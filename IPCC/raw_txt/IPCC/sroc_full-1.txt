Foreword
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was 
jointly established by the World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) in 1988 to assess available information on the 
science, the impacts, and the economics of, and the options 
for mitigating and/or adapting to, climate change. In addition, 
the IPCC provides, on request, scientiﬁc, technical, and socio-
economic advice to the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC). The IPCC has produced a series of Assessment 
Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, and 
other products that have become standard works of reference 
and that are widely used by policymakers, scientists, and other 
experts.
The Special Report on Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the 
Global Climate System was developed in response to invitations 
by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC)1 and the Montreal Protocol on Substances 
that Deplete the Ozone Layer2. IPCC and the Montreal Protocol’s 
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) were 
asked to work together to develop a balanced scientiﬁc, technical 
and policy-relevant Special Report. The request covered both 
a scientiﬁc assessment of the interrelations between the ozone 
layer and climate change and development of user-friendly and 
policy-neutral information to assist all Parties and stakeholders 
in making informed decisions when evaluating alternatives to 
ozone-depleting substances.
Discussions on these topics have a long history, including 
deliberations at the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the 
UNFCCC (held in 1998 in Buenos Aires) which invited Parties 
and all other relevant entities to provide information to the 
UNFCCC Secretariat on available and potential ways and 
means of limiting emissions of hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs) and 
perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs) when used as replacements for ozone 
depleting substances. In 1999, an IPCC/TEAP Expert Meeting 
was organized3, which addressed the issue and forms important 
background for the present effort, along with new information 
on science, technology, and policy needs.
After the decision of the Eighth Conference of the Parties to 
the UNFCCC1,  the Fourteenth Meeting of the Parties to the 
Montreal Protocol (Rome, Italy, 25-29 November 2002), 
welcomed this decision, and requested the TEAP to work 
with the IPCC in preparing the Special Report, and requested 
simultaneous submission of the report to the Open Ended 
Working Group under The Montreal Protocol and the UNFCCC 
SBSTA. The scope, structure, and outline of the Special Report 
were approved by the IPCC in plenary meetings during its 
Twentieth Session in Paris, France, from 19-21 February 2003.
As is usual in the IPCC, success in producing this report has 
depended ﬁrst and foremost on the enthusiasm and cooperation 
of experts worldwide in many related but different disciplines. 
We would like to express our gratitude to all the Coordinating 
Lead Authors, Lead Authors, Contributing Authors, Review 
Editors, and Expert Reviewers. These individuals have devoted 
enormous time and effort to produce this report and we are 
extremely grateful for their commitment to the IPCC process.
We would also like to express our sincere thanks to the Steering 
Committee for this Report, which consisted of co-chairs from 
both the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) 
and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): 
Stephen Andersen, Lambert Kuijpers, and José Pons
for the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel 
(TEAP), and
Susan Solomon, Ogunlade Davidson and Bert Metz (chair 
of the Steering Committee)
for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC).

Preface
This Special Report on Safeguarding the Ozone and the Global 
Climate System has been developed in response to invitations 
from Parties to the UNFCCC and the Montreal Protocol. It 
provides information relevant to decision-making in regard to 
safeguarding the ozone layer and the global climate system: 
two global environmental issues involving complex scientiﬁc 
and technical considerations. The scope, structure, and 
outline of this Special Report were approved by the IPCC at 
its Twentieth Session in Paris, France, 19–21 February 2003. 
The responsibility for preparing the report was given jointly to 
IPCC’s Working Groups I and III and the Montreal Protocol's 
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP). A joint 
IPCC/ TEAP Steering Committee (see below) was established to 
manage preparation of the report following IPCC procedures.
Background
Scientiﬁc evidence linking chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) and 
other Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) to global ozone 
depletion led to the initial control of chemicals under the 1987 
Montreal Protocol and to Amendments and Adjustments in 
the 1990s that added additional ODSs, agreed phaseouts, and 
accelerated those phaseouts. This international process has 
resulted in (i) elimination of production of most CFCs, methyl 
chloroform, and halons, (ii) the increased use of existing 
hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs), (iii) the new production 
of a wide range of industrial ﬂuorine containing chemicals, 
including new types of HCFCs, hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs) and 
perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs), (iv) use of non-halogenated chemical 
substitutes such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and ammonia 
and (v) the development of not-in-kind alternative methods 
such as water-based cleaning procedures.
 
The likelihood that CFCs and other ODSs also affect the 
climate system was ﬁrst identiﬁed in the 1970s, and the global 
warming effectiveness of halocarbons, including HFCs, has been 
further elucidated over the past three decades. For example, the 
1989 Scientiﬁc Assessment of Stratospheric Ozone included a 
chapter on halocarbon global warming potentials (GWPs) and 
the 1989 Technology Assessment presented these GWPs in 
discussions of the importance of energy efﬁciency in insulating 
foam, refrigeration, and air conditioning. As various approaches 
were developed to the phase-out of ODSs under the Montreal 
Protocol, it was realized that some actions taken to reduce future 
depletion of the ozone layer, in particular the introduction of 
HFCs and PFCs, could increase or decrease global warming 
impact. 
This scientiﬁc and technical information allowed Parties to the 
Montreal Protocol to choose options to replace ODSs, mindful 
of the global warming impact and was reﬂected in some 
investment decisions under the Montreal Protocol Multilateral 
Fund. When the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated in 1997, 
countries had new incentives to take account of how choices 
among substitutes could affect the objectives of both protocols. 
These considerations created a need for more comprehensive 
information regarding options for ODS replacement that take 
into account the need of safeguarding the ozone layer as well 
as the global climate system. In May 1999, the IPCC and 
TEAP held a joint expert meeting on options for the limitation 
of Emissions of HFCs and PFCs and in October 1999 TEAP 
published its report: “The implications to the Montreal Protocol 
of the Inclusion of HFCs and PFCs in the Kyoto Protocol”. This 
Special Report of 2005 is the latest cooperative effort. 
 
The potential of each ODS substitute to inﬂuence the climate 
system depends not only upon the physical and chemical 
properties of the substance itself but also upon the factors that 
inﬂuence emissions to the atmosphere, such as containment, 
recycling, destruction and energy efﬁciency in particular 
applications. Gases, applications and sectors considered in the 
report are those related to emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs 
and PFCs, as well as to alternatives for the use of HFCs and 
PFCs. The report does not consider unrelated industrial or other 
uses of the same chemicals The report covers chemicals and 
technologies in use or likely to be used in the next decade.
Organization of the Report
The report provides the scientiﬁc context required for 
consideration of choices among alternatives to ODSs (chapters 
1 and 2); potential methodologies for assessing options (chapter 
3); and technical issues relating to GHG emission reduction 
opportunities for each of the sectors involved, including 
refrigeration, air conditioning, foams, aerosols, ﬁre protection 
and solvents (chapters 4 to 10). The report also addresses the 
future availability of HFCs (chapter 11).
 
Chapters 1 and 2 address linkages between ozone depletion 
and climate change, and draw from previous international 
scientiﬁc assessments, particularly the periodic assessments 
conducted under the auspices of WMO, UNEP, and the IPCC 
(e.g., the most recent Scientiﬁc Assessment of Ozone Depletion, 
2002, the Assessment of the Environmental Impacts of Ozone 
Depletion, 2002, and Climate Change: The Scientiﬁc Basis, 
2001). Chapter 1 covers stratospheric chemistry and dynamics

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Climate System
and their coupling to climate change, while chapter 2 covers 
radiative forcing of each of the relevant gases as well as their 
roles in tropospheric chemistry and air quality. The present 
report does not seek to cover the breadth and depth of the more 
specialized ozone and climate change assessments, but rather 
to provide a summary of relevant interactions between the two 
environmental issues to aid the understanding and application 
of the rest of the report. 
 
Chapter 3 summarizes available methodologies to 
characterize or compare technologies (such as the lifecycle 
climate performance parameter, LCCP), particularly those 
approaches that are applied across the diverse sectors covered 
in this report. 
 
Chapters 4 through 10 then provide technical descriptions 
and information for each of the key sectors of halocarbon use: 
refrigeration (4), residential and commercial air conditioning 
and heating (5), mobile air conditioning (6), foams (7), medical 
aerosols (8), ﬁre protection (9), and non-medical aerosols, 
solvents and HFC-23 byproduct emissions from HCFC-22 
production (10). Each chapter provides an overview of its 
sector, the relevant technologies, information on consumption 
and emission of relevant gases, and practices and alternative 
technologies to reduce emissions and net warming impacts. This 
includes consideration of process improvement in applications, 
improved containment, recovery and recycling during operation, 
end-of-life recovery, disposal and destruction. The choices 
among options within each sector involve detailed consideration 
of technical factors including performance, environmental 
health and safety, cost, availability of alternatives, and total 
energy and resource efﬁciencies. 
  
Chapter 11 covers both supply and demand issues for HFCs, 
and integrates emissions estimates across sectors and regions. 
It aggregates the emissions information for various chemicals 
from the various sectors, and considers the balance between 
supply and demand of HFCs. 
 
As in past IPCC reports, this report contains a Summary for 
Policymakers (SPM) and a Technical Summary (TS), in addition 
to the main chapters. Each section of the SPM and TS has been 
referenced to the appropriate section of the relevant chapter, so 
that material in the SPM and TS can easily be followed up in 
further detail in the chapters. The report also contains annexes 
with a the list of Authors and Expert Reviewers, a glossary, a 
list of acronyms and abbreviations, a list of units and conversion 
factors, and an overview of major chemical formulae and 
nomenclature of substances that are considered in this report.
 
The report was compiled between August 2003 and April 
2005 by 145 experts from 35 countries. The draft report was 
circulated for review by experts, which submitted valuable 
suggestions for improvement. This was followed by a second 
review by both governments and experts. In these two review 
rounds, about 6600 comments were received from about 175 
experts, governments and non-governmental organizations. 
This review process, and its oversight by Review Editors who 
are independent of the author teams, is an intrinsic part of any 
IPCC assessment and is an important part of ensuring the quality 
and credibility of the product. 
 
The ﬁnal report was considered by a joint Session of IPCC 
Working Groups I and III held in Addis Ababa from April 6th 
to 8th, 2005, where the SPM was approved line-by-line and the 
underlying report was accepted by the IPCC Panel.

climate change and are among possible non-ozone depleting alternatives for ODSs. Red denotes gases included under the Montreal Protocol and 
its amendments and adjustments4 while green denotes those included under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. Options considered in this

This IPCC Special Report was developed in response to 
invitations by the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC)1 and the Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer2 to prepare a balanced 
scientific, technical and policy relevant report regarding 
alternatives to ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) that affect 
the global climate system. It has been prepared by the IPCC 
and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) 
of the Montreal Protocol. 
Because ODSs cause depletion of the stratospheric ozone 
layer3, their production and consumption are controlled 
under the Montreal Protocol and consequently are being 
phased out, with efforts made by both developed and 
developing country parties to the Montreal Protocol. Both the 
ODSs and a number of their substitutes are greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) which contribute to climate change (see Figure  
SPM-1). Some ODS substitutes, in particular 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs),

Summary for Policymakers
6 It should be noted that the National Inventory Reporting community uses the term ‘indirect emissions’ to refer specifically to those greenhouse gas emissions 
which arise from the breakdown of another substance in the environment. This is in contrast to the use of the term in this report, which specifically refers to 
energy-related CO2 emissions associated with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches such as Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) or Life Cycle Climate 
Performance (LCCP).
are covered under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. 
Options chosen to protect the ozone layer could influence 
climate change. Climate change may also indirectly influence 
the ozone layer.
This report considers the effects of total emissions of ODSs 
and their substitutes on the climate system and the ozone 
layer. In particular, this provides a context for understanding 
how replacement options could affect global warming. The 
report does not attempt to cover comprehensively the effect of 
replacement options on the ozone layer.
The report considers, by sector, options for reducing 
halocarbon emissions, options involving alternative 
substances, and technologies, to address greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction. It considers HFC and PFC emissions 
insofar as these relate to replacement of ODSs. HFC and 
PFC emissions from aluminum or semiconductor production 
or other sectors are not covered.
The major application sectors using ODSs and their HFC/
PFC substitutes include refrigeration, air conditioning, foams, 
aerosols, fire protection and solvents. Emissions of these 
substances originate from manufacture and any unintended 
byproduct releases, intentionally emissive applications, 
evaporation and leakage from banks contained in equipment 
and products during use, testing and maintenance, and end-
of-life practices.
With regard to specific emission reduction options, the 
report generally limits its coverage to the period up to 2015, 
for which reliable literature is available on replacement 
options with significant market potential for these rapidly 
evolving sectors. Technical performance, potential assessment 
methodologies and indirect emissions6 related to energy use 
are considered, as well as costs, human health and safety, 
implications for air quality, and future availability issues.

Summary for Policymakers
Figure SPM-2. Direct and indirect radiative forcing (RF) due to 
changes in halocarbons from 1750 to 2000.9 Error bars denote ±2 
standard-deviation uncertainties. [Based on Table 1.1]
7  Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system, and is 
an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. It is expressed in watts per square meter (W m–2). A greenhouse gas causes 
direct radiative forcing through absorption and emission of radiation and may cause indirect radiative forcing through chemical interactions that influence other 
greenhouse gases or particles. 
8  Numbers in square brackets indicate the sections in the main report where the underlying material and references for the paragraph can be found.
9  PFCs used as substitutes for ODSs make only a small contribution to the total PFC radiative forcing.
10 In this Summary for Policymakers, the following words have been used where appropriate to indicate judgmental estimates of confidence: very likely (90–99% 
chance); likely (66–90% chance); unlikely (10–33% chance); and very unlikely (1–10% chance).
2.1 What are the past and present effects of 
ODSs and their substitutes on the Earth’s 
climate and the ozone layer?
Halocarbons, and in particular ODSs, have contributed to 
positive direct radiative forcing7 and associated increases 
in global average surface temperature (see Figure SPM-
2). The total positive direct radiative forcing due to 
increases in industrially produced ODS and non-ODS 
halocarbons from 1750 to 2000 is estimated to be 0.33 
± 0.03 W m–2, representing about 13% of the total due 
to increases in all well-mixed greenhouse gases over that 
period. Most halocarbon increases have occurred in recent 
decades. Atmospheric concentrations of CFCs were stable 
or decreasing in the period 2001–2003 (0 to –3% per year, 
depending on the specific gas) while the halons and the 
substitute hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and HFCs 
increased (+1 to +3% per year, +3 to +7% per year, and +13 
to +17% per year, respectively). [1.1, 1.2, 1.5 and 2.3]8
Stratospheric ozone depletion observed since 1970 is 
caused primarily by increases in concentrations of reactive 
chlorine and bromine compounds that are produced by 
degradation of anthropogenic ODSs, including halons, 
CFCs, HCFCs, methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), carbon 
tetrachloride (CCl4) and methyl bromide (CH3Br). [1.3 
and 1.4]
Ozone depletion produces a negative radiative forcing 
of climate, which is an indirect cooling effect of the 
ODSs (see Figure SPM-2). Changes in ozone are believed 
to currently contribute a globally averaged radiative forcing 
of about –0.15 ± 0.10 W m–2. The large uncertainty in the 
indirect radiative forcing of ODSs arises mainly because of 
uncertainties in the detailed vertical distribution of ozone 
depletion. This negative radiative forcing is very likely10 to be 
smaller than the positive direct radiative forcing due to ODSs 
alone (0.32 ± 0.03 W m–2). [1.1, 1.2 and 1.5]
Warming due to ODSs and cooling associated with ozone 
depletion are two distinct climate forcing mechanisms 
that do not simply offset one another. The spatial and 
seasonal distributions of the cooling effect of ozone depletion 
differ from those of the warming effect. A limited number of 
global climate modelling and statistical studies suggest that 
ozone depletion is one mechanism that may affect patterns 
of climate variability which are important for tropospheric 
circulation and temperatures in both hemispheres. However, 
observed changes in these patterns of variability cannot be 
unambiguously attributed to ozone depletion. [1.3 and 1.5]

Summary for Policymakers
Figure SPM-3. Observed and modelled low- and mid-latitude 
(60ºS–60ºN) column ozone amounts as percent deviations from the 
1980 values. [Box 1.7]
11 GWPs are indices comparing the climate impact of a pulse emission of a greenhouse gas relative to that of emitting the same amount of CO2, integrated over a 
fixed time horizon.
Each type of gas has had different greenhouse warming 
and ozone depletion effects (see Figure SPM-2) depending 
mainly on its historic emissions, effectiveness as a 
greenhouse gas, lifetime and the amount of chlorine and/
or bromine in each molecule. Bromine-containing gases 
currently contribute much more to cooling than to warming, 
whereas CFCs and HCFCs contribute more to warming than 
to cooling. HFCs and PFCs contribute only to warming. [1.5 
and 2.5]
2.2 How does the phase-out of ODSs affect 
efforts to address climate change and 
ozone depletion?
Actions taken under the Montreal Protocol have led to 
the replacement of CFCs with HCFCs, HFCs, and other 
substances and processes. Because replacement species 
generally have lower global warming potentials11 (GWPs), 
and because total halocarbon emissions have decreased, 
their combined CO2-equivalent (direct GWP-weighted) 
emission has been reduced. The combined CO2-equivalent 
emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs derived from 
atmospheric observations decreased from about 7.5 ± 0.4 
GtCO2-eq per year around 1990 to 2.5 ± 0.2 GtCO2-eq 
per year around 2000, equivalent to about 33% and 10%, 
respectively, of the annual CO2 emissions due to global fossil 
fuel burning. Stratospheric chlorine levels have approximately 
stabilized and may have already started to decline. [1.2, 2.3 
and 2.5]
Ammonia and those hydrocarbons (HCs) used as 
halocarbon substitutes have atmospheric lifetimes ranging 
from days to months, and the direct and indirect radiative 
forcings associated with their use as substitutes are very 
likely to have a negligible effect on global climate. Changes 
in energy-related emissions associated with their use may 
also need to be considered. (See Section 4 for treatment of 
comprehensive assessment of ODS replacement options.) 
[2.5]
Based on the Business-As-Usual scenario developed in 
this report, the estimated direct radiative forcing of HFCs 
in 2015 is about 0.030 W m–2; based on scenarios from 
the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES), 
the radiative forcing of PFCs9 in 2015 is about 0.006  
W m–2. Those HFC and PFC radiative forcings correspond to 
about 1.0% and 0.2%, respectively, of the estimated radiative 
forcing of all well-mixed greenhouse gases in 2015, with the 
contribution of ODSs being about 10%. While this report 
particularly focused on scenarios for the period up to 2015, 
for the period beyond 2015 the IPCC SRES scenarios were 
considered but were not re-assessed. These SRES scenarios 
project significant growth in radiative forcing from HFCs 
over the following decades, but the estimates are likely to be 
very uncertain due to growing uncertainties in technological 
practices and policies. [1.5, 2.5 and 11.5]
Observations and model calculations suggest that the 
global average amount of ozone depletion has now 
approximately stabilized (for example, see Figure 
SPM-3). Although considerable variability in ozone is 
expected from year to year, including in polar regions 
where depletion is largest, the ozone layer is expected to 
begin to recover in coming decades due to declining ODS 
concentrations, assuming full compliance with the Montreal 
Protocol. [1.2 and 1.4]

Summary for Policymakers
Over the long term, projected increases in other 
greenhouse gases could increasingly influence the 
ozone layer by cooling the stratosphere and changing 
stratospheric circulation. As a result of the cooling effect and 
of reducing ODS concentrations, ozone is likely to increase 
over much of the stratosphere, but could decrease in some 
regions, including the Arctic. However, the effects of changes 
in atmospheric circulation associated with climate change 
could be larger than these factors, and the net impact on 
total ozone due to increases in atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases is currently uncertain in both magnitude 
and sign. Based on current models an Arctic ‘ozone hole’ 
similar to that presently observed over the Antarctic is very 
unlikely to occur. [1.4]
The relative future warming and cooling effects of 
emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs and halons 
vary with gas lifetimes, chemical properties and time of 
emission (see Table SPM-1). The atmospheric lifetimes 
range from about a year to two decades for most HFCs and 
HCFCs, decades to centuries for some HFCs and most 
halons and CFCs, and 1000 to 50,000 years for PFCs. 
Direct GWPs for halocarbons range from 5 to over 10,000. 
ODS indirect cooling is projected to cease upon ozone layer 
recovery, so that GWPs associated with the indirect cooling 
effect depend on the year of emission, compliance with the 
Montreal Protocol and gas lifetimes. These indirect GWPs are 
subject to much greater uncertainties than direct GWPs. [1.5, 
2.2 and 2.5]
2.3 What are the implications of substitu-
tion of ODSs for air quality and 
other environmental issues relating to 
atmospheric chemistry?
Substitution for ODSs in air conditioning, refrigeration, 
and foam blowing by HFCs, PFCs, and other gases such as 
hydrocarbons are not expected to have a significant effect 
on global tropospheric chemistry. Small but not negligible 
impacts on air quality could occur near localized emission 
sources and such impacts may be of some concern, for 
instance in areas that currently fail to meet local standards. 
[2.4 and 2.6]
Persistent degradation products (such as trifluoroacetic 
acid, TFA) of HFCs and HCFCs are removed from 
the atmosphere via deposition and washout processes. 
However, existing environmental risk assessment and 
monitoring studies indicate that these are not expected to 
result in environmental concentrations capable of causing 
significant ecosystem damage. Measurements of TFA in 
sea water indicate that the anthropogenic sources of TFA are 
smaller than natural sources, but the natural sources are not 
fully identified. [2.4]

Summary for Policymakers
12 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and banks expressed in terms of CO2-equivalents use GWPs for direct radiative forcing for a 100-year time horizon. Unless 
stated otherwise, the most recent scientific values for the GWPs are used, as assessed in this report and as presented in Table SPM-1 (Column for ‘GWP for direct 
radiative forcing’).
13 Halons cause much larger negative indirect than positive direct radiative forcing and, in the interest of clarity, their effects are not given here.
14 In the BAU projections, it is assumed that all existing measures continue, including Montreal Protocol (phase-out) and relevant national policies. The current 
trends in practices, penetration of alternatives, and emission factors are maintained up to 2015. End-of-life recovery efficiency is assumed not to increase.
15 In this Summary for Policymakers the ‘refrigeration’ sector comprises domestic, commercial, industrial (including food processing and cold storage) and transpor-
tation refrigeration. [4] ‘Stationary air conditioning (SAC)’ comprises residential and commercial air conditioning and heating. [5] ‘Mobile air conditioning (MAC)’ 
applies to cars, buses and passenger compartments of trucks.
3.1 How are production, banks and 
emissions related in any particular year?
Current emissions of ODSs and their substitutes are 
largely determined by historic use patterns. For CFCs and 
HCFCs, a significant contribution (now and in coming 
decades) comes from their respective banks. There are no 
regulatory obligations to restrict these CFC and HCFC 
emissions either under the Montreal Protocol or the 
UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, although some countries 
have effective national policies for this purpose.
Banks are the total amount of substances contained in existing 
equipment, chemical stockpiles, foams and other products not 
yet released to the atmosphere (see Figure SPM-1). The build-
up of banks of (relatively) new applications of HFCs will – in 
the absence of additional bank management measures – also 
significantly determine post 2015 emissions.
3.2 What can observations of atmospheric 
concentrations tell us about banks and 
emissions?
Observations of atmospheric concentrations, combined 
with production and use pattern data, can indicate the 
significance of banks, but not their exact sizes. 
The most accurate estimates of emissions of CFC-11 and 
CFC-12 are derived from observations of atmospheric 
concentrations. Those emissions are now larger than estimated 
releases related to current production, indicating that a 
substantial fraction of these emissions come from banks built 
up through past production. Observations of atmospheric 
concentrations show that global emissions of HFC-134a are 
presently smaller than reported production, implying that 
this bank is growing. The total global amount of HFC-134a 
currently in the atmosphere is believed to be about equal to 
the amount in banks. [2.5 and 11.3.4]
In the case of CFC-11 and some other gases, the lack of 
information on use patterns makes it difficult to assess the 
contribution to observed emissions from current production 
and use. Further work in this area is required to clarify the 
sources.
3.3  How are estimated banks and emissions 
projected to develop in the period 2002 
to 2015?
Banks of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs were estimated 
at about 21 GtCO2-eq in 200212,13. In a Business-As-Usual 
(BAU) scenario, banks are projected to decline to about 18 
GtCO2-eq in 201514. [7, 11.3 and 11.5]
In 2002, CFC, HCFC and HFC banks were about 16, 4   
and 1 GtCO2-eq (direct GWP weighted), respectively (see 
Figure SPM-4). In 2015, the banks are about 8, 5 and 5 
GtCO2-eq, respectively, in the BAU scenario. Banks of PFCs 
used as ODS replacements were about 0.005 GtCO2-eq in 
2002.
CFC banks associated with refrigeration, stationary air-
conditioning (SAC)15 and mobile air-conditioning (MAC) 
equipment are projected to decrease from about 6 to 1 
GtCO2-eq over the period 2002 to 2015, mainly due to 
release to the atmosphere and partly due to end-of-life 
recovery and destruction. CFC banks in foams are projected 
to decrease much more slowly over the same period (from 
10 to 7 GtCO2-eq), reflecting the much slower release of 
banked blowing agents from foams when compared with 
similarly sized banks of refrigerant in the refrigeration and air-
conditioning sector. 
HFC banks have started to build up and are projected to 
reach about 5 GtCO2-eq in 2015. Of these, HFCs banked 
in foams represent only 0.6 GtCO2-eq, but are projected to 
increase further after 2015.

Summary for Policymakers
16 For these emission values the most recent scientific values for GWPs are used (see Table SPM-1, second column, ‘GWP for direct radiative forcing’). If the 
UNFCCC GWPs would be used (Table SPM-1, last column, ‘UNFCCC Reporting GWP’), reported HFC emissions (expressed in tonnes of CO2-eq) would be 
about 15% lower.
In the BAU scenario, total direct emissions of CFCs, 
HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs are projected to represent about 
2.3 GtCO2-eq per year by 2015 (as compared to about 2.5 
GtCO2-eq per year in 2002). CFC and HCFC emissions 
are together decreasing from 2.1 (2002) to 1.2 GtCO2-eq 
per year (2015), and emissions of HFCs are increasing 
from 0.4 (2002) to 1.2 GtCO2-eq per year (2015)16. 
PFC emissions from ODS substitute use are about 0.001 
GtCO2-eq per year (2002) and projected to decrease. [11.3 
and 11.5]
Figure SPM-4 shows the relative contribution of sectors 
to global direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are 
related to the use of ODSs and their substitutes. Refrigeration 
applications together with SAC and MAC contribute the 
bulk of global direct GHG emissions in line with the higher 
emission rates associated with refrigerant banks. The largest 
part of GHG emissions from foams is expected to occur after 
2015 because most releases occur at end-of-life.
With little new production, total CFC banks will decrease 
due to release to the atmosphere during operation and 
disposal. In the absence of additional measures a significant 
part of the CFC banks will have been emitted by 2015. 
Consequently, annual CFC emissions are projected to 
decrease from 1.7 (2002) to 0.3 GtCO2-eq per year (2015).
HCFC emissions are projected to increase from 0.4 (2002) 
to 0.8 GtCO2-eq per year (2015), owing to a steep increase 
expected for their use in (commercial) refrigeration and SAC 
applications. 
The projected threefold increase in HFC emissions is the 
result of increased application of HFCs in the refrigeration, 
SAC and MAC sectors, and due to byproduct emissions of 
HFC-23 from increased HCFC-22 production (from 195 
MtCO2-eq per year in 2002 to 330 MtCO2-eq per year in 
2015 BAU). 
Uncertainties in emission estimates are significant. 
Comparison of results of atmospheric measurements with 
inventory calculations shows differences per group of 
substances in the order of 10 to 25%. For individual gases the 
differences can be much bigger. This is caused by unidentified 
emissive applications of some substances, not accounted for in 
inventory calculations, and uncertainties in the geographically 
distributed datasets of equipment in use. [11.3.4]
The literature does not allow for an estimate of overall 
indirect6 GHG emissions related to energy consumption. 
For individual applications, the relevance of indirect 
GHG emissions over a life cycle can range from low to 
high, and for certain applications may be up to an order 
of magnitude larger than direct GHG emissions. This 
is highly dependent on the specific sector and product/
application characteristics, the carbon-intensity of the 
consumed electricity and fuels during the complete life cycle 
of the application, containment during the use-phase, and the 
end-of-life treatment of the banked substances. [3.2, 4 and 5]

Summary for Policymakers
17 Not-in-kind technologies achieve the same product objective without the use of halocarbons, typically with an alternative approach or unconventional technique. 
Examples include the use of stick or spray pump deodorants to replace CFC-12 aerosol deodorants; the use of mineral wool to replace CFC, HFC or HCFC 
insulating foam; and the use of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) to replace CFC or HFC metered dose inhalers (MDIs).
18 Comprehensive methods, e.g. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), cover all phases of the life cycle for a number of environmental impact categories. The respective 
methodologies are detailed in international ISO standards ISO 14040:1997, ISO 14041:1998, ISO 14042:2000, and ISO 14043:2000. 
19 Typical simplified methods include Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI), which assesses direct and indirect greenhouse emissions connected only with the 
use-phase and disposal; and Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP), which also includes direct and indirect greenhouse emissions from the manufacture of the 
active substances.
20 For this Report, best practice is considered the lowest achievable value of halocarbon emission at a given date, using commercially proven technologies in the 
production, use, substitution, recovery and destruction of halocarbon or halocarbon-based products (for specific numbers, see Table TS-6).
21 For comparison, CO2 emissions related to fossil fuel combustion and cement production were about 24 GtCO2 per year in 2000.
22 The Mitigation Scenario used in this Report, projects the future up to 2015 for the reduction of halocarbon emissions, based on regionally differentiated 
assumptions of best practices.
4.1 What major opportunities have been 
identified for reductions of greenhouse 
gas emissions and how can they be 
assessed?
Reductions in direct GHG emissions are available for 
all sectors discussed in this report and can be achieved 
through:
• improved containment of substances;
• reduced charge of substances in equipment; 
• end-of-life recovery and recycling or destruction of 
substances; 
• increased use of alternative substances with a reduced or 
negligible global warming potential; and
• not-in-kind technologies17.
A comprehensive assessment would cover both direct 
emissions and indirect energy-related emissions, full life-
cycle aspects, as well as health, safety and environmental 
considerations. However, due to limited availability 
of published data and comparative analyses, such 
comprehensive assessments are currently almost absent. 
Methods for determining which technology option has 
the highest GHG emission reduction potential address 
both direct emissions of halocarbons or substitutes and 
indirect energy-related emissions over the full life cycle. In 
addition, comprehensive methods18 assess a wide range of 
environmental impacts. Other, simplified methods19 exist 
to assess life-cycle impacts and commonly provide useful 
indicators for life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of an 
application. Relatively few transparent comparisons applying 
these methods have been published. The conclusions from 
these comparisons are sensitive to assumptions about 
application-specific, and often region- and time-specific 
parameters (e.g., site-specific situation, prevailing climate, 
energy system characteristics). [3.5]
Comparative economic analyses are important to identify 
cost-effective reduction options. However, they require a 
common set of methods and assumptions (e.g., costing 
methodology, time-frame, discount rate, future economic 
conditions, system boundaries). The development of 
simplified standardized methodologies would enable better 
comparisons in the future. [3.3]
The risks of health and safety impacts can be assessed in most 
cases using standardized methods. [3.4 and 3.5] 
GHG emissions related to energy consumption can be 
significant over the lifetime of appliances considered in 
this report. Energy efficiency improvements can thus lead 
to reductions in indirect emissions from these appliances, 
depending on the particular energy source used and 
other circumstances, and produce net cost reductions, 
particularly where the use-phase of the application is long 
(e.g., in refrigeration and SAC).
The assessed literature did not allow for a global estimate 
of this reduction potential, although several case studies at 
technology and country level illustrate this point.
Through application of current best practices20 and 
recovery methods, there is potential to halve (1.2  
GtCO2-eq per year reduction) the BAU direct emissions 
from ODSs and their GHG substitutes by 201521. About 
60% of this potential concerns HFC emissions, 30% 
HCFCs and 10% CFCs. 
The estimates are based on a Mitigation Scenario22 which 
makes regionally differentiated assumptions on best practices in 
production, use, substitution, recovery and destruction of these 
substances. Sectoral contributions are shown in Figure SPM-5.

Summary for Policymakers
23 The presented cost data concern direct emission reductions only. Taking into account energy efficiency improvements may result in even net negative specific costs 
(savings).
24 Costs in this report are given in 2002 US dollars unless otherwise stated.
Of the bank-related emissions that can be prevented in the 
period until 2015, the bulk is in refrigerant-based applications 
where business-as-usual emission rates are considerably more 
significant than they are for foams during the period in 
question. With earlier action, such as recovery/destruction 
and improved containment, more of the emissions from CFC 
banks can be captured.
4.2 What are the sectoral emission 
reduction potentials in 2015 and what 
are associated costs?
In refrigeration applications direct GHG emissions can 
be reduced by 10% to 30%. For the refrigeration sector as 
a whole, the Mitigation Scenario shows an overall direct 
emission reduction of about 490 MtCO2-eq per year by 
2015, with about 400 MtCO2-eq per year predicted for 
commercial refrigeration. Specific costs are in the range 
of 10 to 300 US$/tCO2-eq23,24. Improved system energy 
efficiencies can also significantly reduce indirect GHG 
emissions.
In full supermarket systems, up to 60% lower LCCP19 values 
can be obtained by using alternative refrigerants, improved 
containment, distributed systems, indirect systems or cascade 
systems. Refrigerant specific emission abatement costs range 
for the commercial refrigeration sector from 20 to 280 US$/
tCO2-eq.
In food processing, cold storage and industrial refrigeration, 
ammonia is forecast for increased use in the future, with 
HFCs replacing HCFC-22 and CFCs. Industrial refrigeration 
refrigerant specific emissions abatement costs were determined 
to be in the range from 27 to 37 US/tCO2-eq. In transport 
refrigeration, lower GWP alternatives, such as ammonia, 
hydrocarbons and ammonia/carbon dioxide have been 
commercialized.
The emission reduction potential in domestic refrigeration 
is relatively small, with specific costs in the range of 0 to 
130 US$/tCO2-eq. Indirect emissions of systems using 
either HFC-134a or HC-600a (isobutane) dominate total 
emissions, for different carbon intensities of electric power 
generation. The difference between the LCCP19 of HFC-134a 
and isobutane systems is small and end-of-life recovery, at a 
Figure SPM-5. Sectoral reduction potentials 
for direct emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and 
HFCs in 2015 as compared to the BAU 
projections. The overall reduction potential 
is about half (1.2 GtCO2-eq per year) of the 
BAU direct GHG emissions.

Summary for Policymakers
certain cost increase, can further reduce the magnitude of the 
difference. [4]
Direct GHG emissions of residential and commercial air-
conditioning and heating equipment (SAC) can be reduced 
by about 200 MtCO2-eq per year by 2015 relative to the 
BAU scenario. Specific costs range from –3 to 170 US$/
tCO2-eq23. When combined with improvements in system 
energy efficiencies, which reduce indirect GHG emissions, 
in many cases net financial benefits accrue. Opportunities 
to reduce direct GHG (i.e., refrigerant) emissions can be 
found in (i) more efficient recovery of refrigerant at end-
of-life (in the Mitigation Scenario assumed to be 50% and 
80% for developing and developed countries, respectively); 
(ii) refrigerant charge reduction (up to 20%); (iii) better 
containment and (iv) the use of refrigerants with reduced or 
negligible GWPs in suitable applications. 
Improving the integrity of the building envelope (reduced 
heat gain or loss) can have a significant impact on indirect 
emissions. 
HFC mixtures and hydrocarbons (HCs) (for small systems) 
are used as alternatives for HCFC-22 in developed countries. 
For those applications where HCs can be safely applied, the 
energy efficiency is comparable to fluorocarbon refrigerants. 
Future technical developments could reduce refrigerant 
charge, expanding the applicability of HCs. [5]
In mobile air conditioning, a reduction potential of 180 
MtCO2-eq per year by 2015 could be achieved at a cost of 
20 to 250 US$/tCO2-eq23. Specific costs differ per region 
and per solution. 
Improved containment, and end-of-life recovery (both of 
CFC-12 and HFC-134a) and recycling (of HFC-134a) could 
reduce direct GHG emissions by up to 50%, and total (direct 
and indirect) GHG emissions of the MAC unit by 30 to 40% 
at a financial benefit to vehicle owners. New systems with 
either CO2 or HFC-152a, with equivalent LCCP, are likely 
to enter the market, leading to total GHG system emission 
reductions estimated at 50 to 70% in 2015 at an estimated 
added specific cost of 50 to 180 US$ per vehicle.
Hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon blends, which have been used 
to a limited extent, present suitable thermodynamic properties 
and permit high energy efficiency. However, the safety and 
liability concerns identified by vehicle manufacturers and 
suppliers limit the possible use of hydrocarbons in new 
vehicles. [6.4.4]
Due to the long life-span of most foam applications, by 
2015 a limited emission reduction of 15 to 20 MtCO2-eq 
per year is projected at specific costs ranging from 10 to 
100 US$/tCO2-eq23. The potential for emission reduction 
increases in following decades. 
Several short-term emission reduction steps, such as the 
planned elimination of HFC use in emissive one-component 
foams in Europe, are already in progress and are considered as 
part of the BAU. Two further key areas of potential emission 
reduction exist in the foams sector. The first is a potential 
reduction in halocarbon use in newly manufactured foams. 
However, the enhanced use of blends and the further phase-
out of fluorocarbon use both depend on further technology 
development and market acceptance. Actions to reduce 
HFC use by 50% between 2010 and 2015, would result 
in emission reduction of about 10 MtCO2-eq per year, at 
a specific cost of 15 to 100 US$/tCO2-eq, with further 
reductions thereafter23. 
The second opportunity for emission reduction can be 
found in the worldwide banks of halocarbons contained in 
insulating foams in existing buildings and appliances (about 
9 and 1 GtCO2-eq for CFC and HCFC, respectively in 
2002). Although recovery effectiveness is yet to be proven, 
and there is little experience to date, particularly in the 
buildings sector, commercial operations are already recovering 
halocarbons from appliances at 10 to 50 US$/tCO2-eq23. 
Emission reductions may be about 7 MtCO2-eq per year in 
2015. However, this potential could increase significantly in 
the period between 2030 and 2050, when large quantities of 
building insulation foams will be decommissioned. [7]
The reduction potential for medical aerosols is limited due 
to medical constraints, the relatively low emission level and 
the higher costs of alternatives. The major contribution (14 
MtCO2-eq per year by 2015 compared to a BAU emission 
of 40 MtCO2-eq per year) to a reduction of GHG emissions 
for metered dose inhalers (MDIs) would be the completion 
of the transition from CFC to HFC MDIs beyond what was 
already assumed as BAU. The health and safety of the patient 
is considered to be of paramount importance in treatment 
decisions, and there are significant medical constraints to limit 
the use of HFC MDIs. If salbutamol MDIs (approximately 
50% of total MDIs) would be replaced by dry powder 
inhalers (which is not assumed in the Mitigation Scenario) 
this would result in an annual emission reduction of about 10 
MtCO2-eq per year by 2015 at projected costs in the range of 
150 to 300 US$/tCO2-eq. [8]
In fire protection, the reduction potential by 2015 is small 
due to the relatively low emission level, the significant 
shifts to not-in-kind alternatives in the past and the 
lengthy procedures for introducing new equipment.
Direct GHG emissions for the sector are estimated at about 
5 MtCO2-eq per year in 2015 (BAU). Seventy five percent of 
original halon use has been shifted to agents with no climate 
impact. Four percent of the original halon applications 
continue to employ halons. The remaining 21% has been

Summary for Policymakers
shifted to HFCs with a small number of applications shifted 
to HCFCs and to PFCs. PFCs are no longer needed for new 
fixed systems and are limited to use as a propellant in one 
manufacturer’s portable extinguisher agent blend. Due to the 
lengthy process of testing, approval and market acceptance of 
new fire protection equipment types and agents, no additional 
options will likely have appreciable impact by 2015. With 
the introduction of a fluoroketone (FK) in 2002, additional 
reductions at an increased cost are possible in this sector 
through 2015. Currently those reductions are estimated to be 
small compared to other sectors. [9]
For non-medical aerosols and solvents there are several 
reduction opportunities, but the reduction potentials are 
likely to be rather small because most remaining uses 
are critical to performance or safety. The projected BAU 
emissions by 2015 for solvents and aerosols are about 14 and 
23 MtCO2-eq per year, respectively. Substitution of HFC-
134a by HFC-152a in technical aerosol dusters is a leading 
option for reducing GHG emissions. For contact cleaners 
and plastic casting mould release agents, the substitution of 
HCFCs by hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) and HFCs with lower 
GWPs offers an opportunity. Some countries have banned 
HFC use in cosmetic, convenience and novelty aerosol 
products, although HFC-134a continues to be used in many 
countries for safety reasons.
A variety of organic solvents can replace HFCs, PFCs and 
ODSs in many applications. These alternative fluids include 
lower GWP compounds such as traditional chlorinated 
solvents, HFEs, HCs and oxygenated solvents. Many not-in-
kind technologies, including no-clean and aqueous cleaning 
processes, are also viable alternatives. [10]
Destruction of byproduct emissions of HFC-23 from 
HCFC-22 production has a reduction potential of up to 
300 MtCO2-eq per year by 2015 and specific costs below 
0.2 US$/tCO2-eq according to two European studies in 
2000.
Reduction of HCFC-22 production due to market forces 
or national policies, or improvements in facility design and 
construction also could reduce HFC-23 emissions. [10.4]
4.3 What are the current policies, measures 
and instruments?
A variety of policies, measures and instruments have been 
implemented in reducing the use or emissions of ODSs 
and their substitutes, such as HFCs and PFCs. These 
include regulations, economic instruments, voluntary 
agreements and international cooperation. Furthermore, 
general energy or climate policies affect the indirect GHG 
emissions of applications with ODSs, their substitutes, or 
not-in-kind alternatives. 
This report contains information on policies and approaches 
in place in some countries (mainly developed) for reducing 
the use or emissions of ODSs and their substitutes. Those 
relevant policies and approaches include:
• Regulations (e.g., performance standards, certification, 
restrictions, end-of-life management)
• Economic instruments (e.g., taxation, emissions trading, 
financial incentives and deposit refunds)
• Voluntary agreements (e.g., voluntary reductions in use 
and emissions, industry partnerships and implementation 
of good practice guidelines)
• International cooperation (e.g., Clean Development 
Mechanism)
It should be noted that policy considerations are dependent 
on specific applications, national circumstances and other 
factors.
4.4 What can be said about availability 
of HFCs/PFCs in the future for use in 
developing countries?
No published data are available to project future 
production capacity. However, as there are no technical 
or legal limits to HFC and PFC production, it can be 
assumed that the global production capacity will generally 
continue to satisfy or exceed demand. Future production 
is therefore estimated in this report by aggregating sectoral 
demand. 
In the BAU scenario, global production capacity is expected 
to expand with additions taking place mainly in developing 
countries and through joint ventures. Global production 
capacity of HFCs and PFCs most often exceeds current 
demand. There are a number of HFC-134a plants in 
developed countries and one plant in a developing country 
with others planned; the few plants for other HFCs are 
almost exclusively in developed countries. The proposed 
European Community phase-out of HFC-134a in mobile 
air conditioners in new cars and the industry voluntary 
programme to reduce their HFC-134a emissions by 50% will 
affect demand and production capacity and output. Rapidly 
expanding markets in developing countries, in particular 
for replacements for CFCs, is resulting in new capacity for 
fluorinated gases which is at present being satisfied through 
the expansion of HCFC-22 and 141b capacity. [11]

Technical Summary
This IPCC Special Report was developed in response to 
invitations by the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC)1,2 and the Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer3 to prepare a balanced 
scientific, technical and policy relevant report regarding 
alternatives to ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) that affect 
the global climate system. It has been prepared by the IPCC 
and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) 
of the Montreal Protocol. 
Because ODSs cause depletion of the stratospheric ozone 
layer4, their production and consumption are controlled 
under the Montreal Protocol and consequently are being 
phased out, with efforts made by both developed and 
developing country parties to the Montreal Protocol. Both the 
ODSs and a number of their substitutes are greenhouse gases 
(GHGs) which contribute to climate change (see Figure  
TS-1). Some ODS substitutes, in particular 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), are 
covered under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. Options

climate change and are among possible non-ozone depleting alternatives for ODSs. Red denotes gases included under the Montreal Protocol and 
its amendments and adjustments5 while green denotes those included under the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. Options considered in this

Technical Summary
chosen to protect the ozone layer could influence climate 
change. Climate change may also indirectly influence the 
ozone layer.
This report considers the effects of total emissions of ODSs 
and their substitutes on the climate system and the ozone 
layer. In particular, this provides a context for understanding 
how replacement options could affect global warming. The 
report does not attempt to cover comprehensively the effect of 
replacement options on the ozone layer.
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have been used to 
replace chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in several applications 
as they have shorter lifetimes in the atmosphere and 
consequently cause less ozone depletion. HFCs and PFCs 
have been identified as potential long-term replacements for 
ODSs because they contain neither bromine nor chlorine 
and do not cause any significant ozone depletion. However, 
all of these species are also GHGs and so contribute to 
climate change in varying degrees. Additional alternatives for 
halocarbon use include ammonia and organic substances, the 
direct emissions of which have a very small effect on climate 
although indirect emissions may be important.
The report considers, by sector, options for reducing 
halocarbon emissions, options involving alternative 
substances, and technologies, to address greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction. It considers HFC and PFC emissions 
insofar as these relate to replacement of ODSs. HFC and 
PFC emissions from aluminum or semiconductor production 
or other sectors where ODS replacement is not involved are 
not covered.  
The major application sectors using ODSs and their HFC/
PFC substitutes include refrigeration, air conditioning, foams, 
aerosols, fire protection and solvents. Emissions of these 
substances originate from manufacture and any unintended 
byproduct releases, intentionally emissive applications, 
evaporation and leakage from banks contained in equipment 
and products during use, testing and maintenance, and end-
of-life practices.
With regard to specific emission reduction options, the 
report generally limits its coverage to the period up to 2015, 
for which reliable literature is available on replacement 
options with significant market potential for these rapidly 
evolving sectors. Technical performance, potential assessment 
methodologies and indirect emissions7 related to energy use 
are considered, as well as costs, human health and safety, 
implications for air quality, and future availability issues.
The Technical Summary (TS) brings together key information 
from the underlying report and follows to some extent 
the report structure, which is in three parts. The first part 
describes scientific links between stratospheric ozone depletion 
and climate change and provides relevant information on 
radiative forcing, observations of changes in forcing agents 
and emissions (section 2 of the TS). It addresses how the 
phase-out of ODSs is affecting both stratospheric ozone 
and climate change as well as the implications for air quality 
and local environmental issues. The report does not seek to 
cover the breadth and depth of other specialized assessments 
of ozone depletion and climate change, but rather to assess 
relevant interactions between the two environmental issues 
pertinent to the consideration of replacement options.
The second part assesses options to replace ODSs, including 
environmental, health, safety, availability and technical 
performance issues (section 3 and 4 of the TS). The report 
assesses practices and alternative technologies to reduce 
emissions and net warming impacts within each use 
sector, including consideration of process improvement in 
applications, improved containment, end-of-life recovery, 
recycling, disposal and destruction as well as relevant policies 
and measures. 
The third part of the report covers supply and demand issues. 
The report aggregates available information on emissions 
from the various sectors and regions and considers the balance 
between supply and demand, bearing in mind those issues 
relevant to developing countries (section 3.8 in the TS). 
7 It should be noted that the National Inventory Reporting community uses the term ‘indirect emissions’ to refer specifically to those greenhouse gas emissions 
which arise from the breakdown of another substance in the environment. This is in contrast to the use of the term in this report, which specifically refers to 
energy-related CO2 emissions associated with Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approaches such as Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) or Life Cycle Climate 
Performance (LCCP).

Technical Summary
2.1 How do the CFCs and their 
replacements contribute to the radiative 
forcing of the climate system? 
Many halocarbons, including CFCs, PFCs, HFCs and 
HCFCs, are effective GHGs because they absorb Earth’s 
outgoing infrared radiation in a spectral range where energy 
is not removed by CO2 or water vapour (sometimes referred 
to as the atmospheric window, see Figure TS-2). Halocarbon 
molecules can be many thousand times more efficient at 
absorbing radiant energy emitted from the Earth than a 
molecule of CO2 , and small amounts of these gases can 
contribute significantly to radiative forcing8 of the climate 
system. [1.1]9
Radiative efficiencies (W m–2 ppb–1) for the halocarbons and 
other well-mixed GHGs that are reported under the Montreal 
and Kyoto Protocols are given in Table TS-1. For most of 
the species considered here, the magnitude of the direct 
radiative forcing generated by a gas is given by the product 
of its mixing ratio (in parts per billion, ppb) and radiative 
efficiency. For the more abundant greenhouse gases − CO2, 
methane and nitrous oxide − there is a nonlinear relationship 
between mixing ratio and radiative forcing. [1.1]
The primary radiative effect of CO2 and water vapour is to 
warm the surface climate but cool the stratosphere. However, 
due to their absorption in the atmospheric window, the 
direct radiative effect of halocarbons is to warm both the 
troposphere and stratosphere. [1.2 and Box 1.4]
2. Halocarbons, ozone depletion and climate change
8 Radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a factor has in altering the balance of incoming and outgoing energy in the Earth-atmosphere system, and is 
an index of the importance of the factor as a potential climate change mechanism. It is expressed in watts per square meter (W m–2). A greenhouse gas causes 
direct radiative forcing through absorption and emission of radiation and may cause indirect radiative forcing through chemical interactions that influence other 
greenhouse gases or particles.

Technical Summary
Apart from their direct effect on climate, some gases have 
an indirect effect either from radiative forcing caused by 
their degradation products or through their influences on 
atmospheric chemistry. Halocarbons containing chlorine and 
bromine are ODSs and, because ozone is a strong absorber 
of UV radiation, they have an indirect cooling effect which 
is significant compared to their direct warming effect. For 
hydrocarbons, indirect effects associated with tropospheric 
ozone production may be significantly greater than direct 
effects. [1.1, 1.5, Box 1.3, 2.2 and 2.5]
2.2 How long do CFCs and their 
replacements remain in the atmosphere 
after they are emitted?
Gases with longer lifetimes remain in the atmosphere, and 
consequently may affect climate, for a longer time. The 
lifetimes of several halocarbons and replacement species 
are given in Table TS-1. Most CFCs are removed from the 
atmosphere on time scales ranging from about 50 to 100 
years. With the exception of HFC-23, which has a lifetime 
of 270 years, HCFCs and HFCs are removed efficiently in 
Table TS-1. Radiative efﬁciencies, lifetimes and positive direct radiative forcing for the well-mixed GHGs and halocarbons normally reported 
under the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols due to their increases between 1750 and 2000 and between 1970 and 2000. See Section 1.1, especi-
ally Table 1.1, and Section 2.2, especially Table 2.6, for details.

a The radiative efﬁciency of CO2 decreases as its concentration increases. 
b Removal of CO2 from the atmosphere involves many different processes and its rate cannot be expressed accurately with a single lifetime. However, carbon 
cycle models typically estimate that 30 to 50% of CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere for more than 100 years. 
c The lifetimes of CH4 and N2O incorporate indirect effects of the emission of each gas on its own lifetime.

the troposphere through atmospheric chemistry oxidation 
processes. As a result, they have lifetimes ranging from about 
one year to a few decades. PFCs are very inert molecules and 
their emissions contribute to warming of the climate system 
over timescales that can exceed 1000 years. [2.2]
Most halocarbon gases are sufficiently long-lived that they 
become mixed throughout the atmosphere before they are 
destroyed. They therefore have nearly constant mixing ratios 
throughout the troposphere. In contrast, ammonia and 
organic compounds have lifetimes that typically range from 
days to weeks, thereby making their distributions variable 
both spatially and temporally. [2.2]
2.3 How are the atmospheric concentrations 
and emissions of CFCs, halons, HCFCs, 
HFCs and PFCs changing?
Atmospheric observations, as seen for example in Figure TS-3, 
show that global concentrations of the CFCs increased largely 
during the period from the 1970s to the 1990s, so that their 
contributions to radiative forcing grew mainly during this 
period, while the concentrations of replacement species are 
now increasing. HCFC-22 is the most abundant HCFC, with 
a current concentration of 160 ppt. Its concentration began 
to increase in the early 1970s concurrently with those of the 
CFCs, while the concentrations of other significant HCFCs 
increased mainly in the 1990s, as did those of the HFCs. 
[1.2, 2.3]
Currently observed rates of change differ among ODSs, 
depending mainly upon their emissions and atmospheric 
lifetimes (see Table TS-2). Following the Montreal Protocol 
and its subsequent amendments, large reductions in ODS 
production and emission have occurred. The concentrations 
of some CFCs have peaked, while others are expected to 
decline in the future. In the complete absence of emissions, 
the concentrations of these gases would decrease, but at a 
slow rate that is determined by their atmospheric lifetimes 
of decades to centuries. Continuing emissions will cause 
increases in the concentrations of these gases or diminish 
their rates of decrease. Observations of annual changes 
in atmospheric concentrations provide the most reliable 
estimates of total global emissions for long-lived gases. For 
example, CFC-11 is observed to be decreasing at a rate about 
60% slower than would occur in the absence of emissions, 
while CFC-12 is still increasing slightly, indicating continuing 
emissions of both species. CFC-113, however, is decreasing 
at a rate close to that expected in the absence of emissions. 
Table TS-2 shows observed global concentrations and growth 
or decay rates of the major CFCs, halons, HCFCs, HFCs 
and PFCs, together with the estimated emissions to the 
atmosphere required to explain currently observed trends.

Technical Summary
Figure TS-4. Radiative forcing (W m–2) due to changes in well 
mixed GHGs and ozone over the time periods 1750 – 2000 and 
1970 – 2000. The negative radiative forcing from stratospheric 
ozone is due to stratospheric ozone depletion resulting from 
halocarbon emissions between 1970 and 2000. In contrast, the 
tropospheric ozone radiative forcing is largely independent of the 
halocarbon radiative forcing. [Figure 1.3]
For comparison, earlier estimates of emissions (WMO, 
2003)10 are also shown for the year 1990, which is slightly 
after the peak in ODS emissions. Emissions of CFC-113 
and CH3CCl3, both used largely as solvents and having 
no accumulated banks, decreased by more than a factor of 
10 from 1990 to 2000. Stratospheric chlorine levels have 
approximately stabilized and may have already started to 
decline. [2.3]
The estimated current emissions of CFC-11 and CFC-12 
shown in Table TS-2 are larger than estimates of new 
production, indicating that a substantial fraction of these 
emissions originates from banks of these chemicals built 
up from past production. Such banks include material 
contained in foams, air conditioning, refrigeration and other 
applications. In contrast, production is currently greater than 
emission for nearly all of the HCFCs and HFCs, implying 
that banks of these chemicals are currently accumulating and 
could contribute to future radiative forcing. One measure of 
the relevance of such banks is the ratio of bank size to the 
amount already in the atmosphere. For example, in the case 
of HFC-134a these amounts are estimated to be about equal. 
[2.3, 2.5 and 11.3]
Continuing atmospheric observations of CFCs and other 
ODSs now enable improved validation of estimates for the 
lag between production and emission to the atmosphere. This 
provides new insight into the overall significance of banks and 
of end-of-life options which are relevant to the future use of 
HCFC and HFC substitutes. [2.5]
For some gases, there are now sufficient atmospheric 
observations to constrain not just global but also regional 
emissions in certain areas. For example, atmospheric 
measurements suggest sharp increases in European emissions 
of HFC-134a over the period 1995–1998 and in HFC-152a 
over the period 1996–2000, with some subsequent levelling 
off through to 2003. [2.3]
2.4 How much do the halocarbon gases and 
their replacements contribute to positive 
radiative forcing of the climate system 
relative to pre-industrial times? What 
about relative to 1970?
The contributions to direct radiative forcing due to increases 
in halocarbon concentrations from 1750 to 2000 and from 
1970 to 2000 are summarized in Table TS-1 and Figure  
TS-4. The direct radiative forcing due to these increases from 
1750 to 2000 is estimated to be 0.33 ± 0.03 W m–2, which 
represents about 13% of the total due to increases in all of 
the well-mixed GHGs over that period. The contributions of 
CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs are about 0.27 W m–2, 0.033  
W m–2 and 0.006 W m–2 respectively. [1.1 and 1.5]
Because increases in halocarbon concentrations occurred 
mainly during the last three decades, their relative 
contribution to total radiative forcing is larger during this 
period. The direct radiative forcing due to increases in 
halocarbons from 1970 to 2000 was 0.27 ± 0.03 W m–2, 
which represents about 23% of that due to increases in all of 
the well-mixed GHGs. The contribution to direct radiative 
forcing due to HCFCs is presently dominated by HCFC-22, 
while that due to HFCs is dominated by HFC-134a and 
HFC-23, with the latter being emitted mainly as a byproduct 
of manufacture of HCFC-22. [1.1, 1.5]

Technical Summary
Figure TS-5. Top: Time-series of de-seasonalized global mean 
column ozone anomalies estimated from five different data sets, 
based on ground-based (black line) and satellite measurements 
(colored lines). Anomalies are expressed as percentages of the time 
average for the period 1964−1980. Bottom: October mean total 
column ozone measurements from the Dobson spectrophotometer  
at Halley, Antarctica (73.5°S, 26.7°W). [Figures 1.4 and 1.5]
2.5 How has stratospheric ozone changed in 
recent decades and why?
As shown in Figure TS-5, the amount of stratospheric ozone 
has decreased over the past few decades, particularly in 
the Antarctic. The largest decreases since 1980 have been 
observed over the Antarctic during the spring (the Antarctic 
ozone hole), with the monthly total column ozone amounts 
in September and October being about 40–50% below pre-
ozone-hole values. [1.2, 1.3 and 1.4]
Arctic ozone loss in any given year depends strongly on the 
meteorological conditions. Arctic ozone has been chemically 
depleted by up to 30% in recent cold years, but the losses 
observed in warm years have been very small. Globally 
averaged ozone has decreased by roughly 3% since 1980. 
The ozone column decreased by about 6% over the mid-
latitudes (35°−60°) in the Southern Hemisphere and 3% in 
the Northern Hemisphere. Significant long-term changes 
in column ozone have not been observed in the tropics. 
Observations and model calculations suggest that the global 
average amount of ozone depletion has now approximately 
stabilized (see Figure TS-5).  [1.2]
The observed ozone changes are caused by both chemical and 
dynamical factors, with the chemical factors being dominant. 
This ozone depletion is caused primarily by increases in 
concentrations of reactive chlorine and bromine compounds 
that are produced by degradation of anthropogenic ODSs, 
including halons, CFCs, HCFCs, methyl chloroform 
(CH3CCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and methyl bromide 
(CH3Br). Human activities have increased the amount of 
chlorine in the stratosphere, relative to estimated natural 
background levels, by a factor of about 5 since 1970. CFCs 
are the primary source of this change, while HCFCs currently 
contribute about 5% to the total stratospheric chlorine 
loading. [1.2, 1.3 and 1.4]
2.6 How has ozone depletion affected the 
radiative forcing of the climate system?
Observations and modelling show that ozone depletion has 
acted to cool the stratosphere, which in turn can contribute 
to cooling of the troposphere and surface. The warming of 
the climate by ODSs and the cooling associated with ozone 
depletion are two distinct mechanisms that are governed by 
different physical processes and feedbacks and for which there 
are quite different levels of scientific understanding. For the 
purposes of this report, we follow IPCC (2001)11 and assume 
that the observed depletion is caused entirely by ODSs and 
that the ozone radiative forcing can be considered to be an 
indirect effect due to ODSs. Gases containing bromine (such 
as halons) are particularly effective ozone depleters and have 
a larger contribution to the indirect effect on a per-molecule 
basis than other ozone-depleting gases such as the CFCs. [1.1, 
1.2, 1.3 and 1.5]

Technical Summary
The best estimate of the negative indirect radiative forcing 
associated with ozone depletion over the period 1970−2000 
is −0.15 ± 0.10 W m–2, where the large uncertainty is 
determined by the range of model estimates and arises mainly 
because of uncertainties in the detailed vertical distribution 
of ozone depletion. This indirect effect is very likely12 to be 
smaller in magnitude than the positive direct radiative forcing 
due to ODSs alone (0.32 ± 0.03 W m−2 ) which is far better 
understood . If some fraction of the observed global ozone 
changes were not attributable to ODSs the magnitude of this 
indirect effect would be reduced. [1.5]
The relative contributions of different types of gas to positive 
direct and negative indirect radiative forcing are shown in 
Figure TS-6. However, the warming and cooling effects 
produced by direct and indirect radiative forcing do not 
simply offset one another because the spatial and seasonal 
distributions of the effects on surface climate are different. 
[1.2, 1.5 and Box 1.4]
A limited number of global climate modelling and statistical 
studies suggest that ozone depletion is one mechanism 
that may affect patterns of climate variability which are 
important for tropospheric circulation and temperatures in 
both hemispheres. In particular, the significant depletion of 
stratospheric ozone occurring in the Antarctic region is likely 
to have affected stratospheric circulation, and consequently 
the troposphere. There are indications that the Antarctic 
ozone hole has contributed to the cooling observed over 
the Antarctic plateau and to warming in the region of the 
Antarctic Peninsula. [1.3]
2.7 What factors are expected to control 
ozone in the coming century?  
Will it ‘recover’ to pre-ozone-hole 
values? Has the recovery already begun?
Global ozone recovery is expected to follow decreases in 
chlorine and bromine loading in the stratosphere as ODS 
concentrations decline due to reductions in their emissions. 
While this is expected to be the dominant factor in ozone 
recovery, emissions of other GHGs (such as CO2, methane 
and nitrous oxide) can affect both tropospheric and 
stratospheric chemistry and climate, and will have some effect 
on ozone recovery. [1.3 and 1.4]
Figure TS-7 shows a range of predictions for changes in 
stratospheric ozone for the latitude range 60°S−60°N from 
two-dimensional photochemical models together with 
comparable ground-based and satellite measurements taken 
up to 2003. Such computer simulations show global ozone 
recovery occurring gradually as halogen gas emissions and 
concentrations decrease. However, the time of recovery varies 
significantly, depending on assumptions made about future 
climate and future composition of the atmosphere, and 
consequently remains quite uncertain. [1.4 and Box 1.7]
Future temperature changes related to GHG emissions 
are expected to enhance stratospheric ozone depletion in 
some parts of the stratosphere and decrease it in others. 
Increases in CO2 concentration are expected to cool the 
stratosphere, which is known to reduce the rates of gas-
phase ozone destruction in much of the stratosphere and 
thereby increase ozone concentrations at altitudes above 
about 25 km. In contrast, lower temperatures could decrease 
ozone concentrations at lower altitudes. While the latter 
effect is expected to be most important in the Arctic in late 
winter to early spring, it may be small compared with other 
Figure TS-6. Radiative forcing due to changes in halocarbons from 
1750 to 2000. [Based on Table 1.1]

chance); unlikely (10–33% chance); and very unlikely (1–10% chance).

Technical Summary
processes and will slowly decrease with time as the chlorine 
and bromine loadings decrease. Changes in stratospheric 
circulation may also occur in association with increases in 
GHGs and these could either increase or decrease future 
mid-latitude and polar ozone. The net result of future GHG 
emissions on global ozone depends upon the combination 
of these effects and its magnitude and direction are poorly 
quantified at present. [1.3 and 1.4]
As can be seen from the measurements shown in Figure  
TS-7, detection of the beginning of ozone recovery is difficult 
because of the high variability in ozone levels. This variability 
is due to both meteorological variability and the confounding 
influence of volcanic eruptions on the ozone layer. As a result, 
it is not yet possible to state that the beginning of ozone 
recovery has been unambiguously identified. [1.2, 1.4 and 
Box 1.7]
Models suggest that minimum levels of Antarctic ozone may 
already have occurred or should occur within the next few 
years. Predictions of the timing of a minimum in Arctic ozone 
are more uncertain due to far greater natural variability in 
this region, but models suggest that it should occur within 
the next two decades. An Arctic ‘ozone hole’ similar to that 
currently observed over the Antarctic is very unlikely to occur. 
[1.3 and 1.4]
2.8 How much are CFCs, HCFCs and their 
possible replacements expected to 
affect the future radiative forcing of the 
climate system?
The estimated radiative forcing of HFCs in 2015 is in the 
range 0.022–0.025 W m–2 based on the SRES emission 
scenarios and in the range 0.019–0.030 W m–2 based on 
scenarios from Chapter 11 of this report. The radiative 
forcing of PFCs in 2015 is about 0.006 W m–2 based on 
SRES scenarios. These HFC and PFC radiative forcings 
correspond to about 6–10% and 2% respectively of the total 
estimated radiative forcing due to CFCs and HCFCs in 2015 
(estimated to be 0.297 W m–2 for the baseline scenario). [2.5 
and 11.5]
Scenario-based projections of future radiative forcing are 
shown in Figure TS-8. Such projections over longer time 
scales become more uncertain due to the growing influences 
of uncertainties in future technological practices and policies, 
but the contribution of HFCs may be 0.1 to 0.25 W m–2 by 
2100 based upon the range of SRES emission scenarios, while 
that of PFCs may be 0.02 to 0.04 W m–2 by 2100. [1.5 and 
2.5]
Figure TS-8 shows estimates of the separate contributions to 
future halocarbon radiative forcing from: past emissions (i.e. 
what is currently in the atmosphere); future emissions of new 
production assuming no change in current practices (based on 
the WMO Ab scenario); and emissions from current banks of 
halocarbons. Two different estimates of this last component 
are shown, one based on the WMO (2003) Ozone Assessment 
and the other based on later sections of this report. Although 
the magnitude of current ODS banks remains uncertain, their 
contribution to radiative forcing is expected to be comparable 
with that of HFC emissions to the atmosphere in the next few 
decades. This indicates that choices with respect to end-of-life 
options, such as the destruction of currently banked material, 
can provide significant benefits for the climate system. End-
of-life recovery, recycling and destruction practices could also 
reduce emissions of all newly produced halocarbons and their 
contribution to radiative forcing shown in Figure TS-8. [1.5]
In addition to reducing atmospheric chlorine loading, actions 
taken under the Montreal Protocol and its adjustments and 
amendments have also acted to reduce total CO2-equivalent 
Figure TS-7. Observed and modelled changes in low- and mid-
latitude (60°S – 60°N) de-seasonalised column ozone relative to 
1980. The black symbols indicate ground-based measurements, 
and the coloured symbols various satellite-based data sets. The 
range of model predictions comes from the use of several different 
two-dimensional photochemistry models forced with the same 
halocarbon scenario; some models also allowed for the effect 
of changing CO2 amounts on stratospheric temperatures. The 
measurements show that column ozone values between 60°S and 
60°N decreased beginning in the early 1980s and the models capture 
the timing and extent of this decrease quite well. Modelled halogen 
source gas concentrations decrease in the early 21st century in 
response to the Montreal Protocol, so that simulated ozone values 
increase and recover towards pre-1980 values. [Box 1.7]

emissions. This has occurred because the replacement species 
generally have lower global warming potentials (GWPs) and 
because total halocarbon emissions have been reduced. The 
reduction can be seen by comparing emissions in 1990 and 
in 2000 given in Table TS-2, and is shown more generally in 
Figure TS-9. Thus the combined CO2-equivalent emissions of 
CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs have decreased from a peak of 7.5 
± 0.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 around 1990 to 2.5 ± 0.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
around 2000, which is equivalent to about 10% of the annual 
contribution due to global fossil fuel burning in that year. 
[2.3 and 2.5]
Ammonia and those hydrocarbons used as halocarbon 
substitutes have atmospheric lifetimes ranging from days 
to months, and the direct and indirect radiative forcings 
associated with their use as substitutes are very likely to have a 
negligible effect on global climate. 
2.9 What is the global warming potential 
and how is it used?
The GWP is a measure of the future radiative effect of an 
emission of a substance relative to the emission of the same 
amount of CO2 integrated over a chosen time horizon. 
The GWP value for a species is proportional to its radiative 
efficiency and increases with its lifetime in the atmosphere. 
GWPs are most useful as relative measures of the climate 
response due to direct radiative forcing of well-mixed 
greenhouse gases whose atmospheric lifetimes are controlled 
by similar processes, which includes most of the halocarbons. 
[2.5 and Box 2.4]
The choice of time horizon is a policy consideration and 
makes a compromise between the relative weighting of short-
term and long-term effects. Current practice most often uses 
GWPs calculated with a 100-year time horizon. This does 
not take into account the full effect of very long-lived gases 
with high radiative efficiency, such as PFCs, that persist in 
the atmosphere for much longer than 100 years. Similarly, 
integrating over 100 years reduces the contribution of short-
lived species that last for only part of that period, relative 
to that of CO2 which continues to contribute to radiative 
forcing throughout the 100-year time horizon and beyond.

negative radiative forcing due to ozone depletion.
c The UNFCCC reporting guidelines use GWP values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (see FCCC/SBSTA/2004/8, http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2004/

d ODSs are not covered under the UNFCCC.
e The IPCC Second Assessment Report does not contain GWP values for HFC-245fa and HFC-365mfc. However, the UNFCCC reporting guidelines contain

Technical Summary
Direct GWP values are given in Table TS-3. These were 
changed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report (IPCC, 
2001) relative to the previous assessment (IPCC, 1996)13 due 
to revisions to the radiative efficiency of CO2 and to some 
lifetimes and radiative efficiencies for other species. Revisions 
to GWP values given for some species in this report are due 
mainly to the use of updated lifetimes as described in section 
2.5.4. [2.5]
The indirect GWPs associated with ozone depletion caused 
by the different ODSs are given in Table TS-3. As ODS 
indirect cooling effects are projected to cease upon ozone 
layer recovery, their duration depends not only on gas 
lifetime but also on the time of ozone recovery. Estimates of 
indirect GWPs incorporate this latter dependence by setting 
all indirect effects to zero after the time at which equivalent 
effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) is estimated to return 
to its pre-1980 values. Indirect GWPs therefore depend on 
the year of emission and have large uncertainties arising 
from: uncertainty in the radiative forcing caused by ozone 
depletion; uncertainties in the amount of EESC attributed 
to each species; and uncertainty in the time at which EESC 
returns to its pre-1980 values.  [1.5 and 2.5]
Given the very different levels of scientific understanding 
and relative uncertainties associated with direct and indirect 
radiative forcing of ODSs, the lack of cancellation in their 
effects on surface climate and the dependence of indirect 
GWPs on the year of emission, this report does not consider 
the use of net GWPs combining direct and indirect effects. 
Where direct GWPs are used with ODS emissions, or to 
construct CO2-equivalent values, it should be recognized that 
there are also indirect effects that may be significant over the 
next several decades. [1.2, 1.5, Box 1.4 and 2.5]
2.10 Are HCFCs, HFCs or their replacements 
expected to have other effects on future 
environmental chemistry?
The emissions of organic gases (including HCFCs, 
HFCs, PFCs and hydrocarbons) and ammonia due to the 
replacement of ODSs in refrigeration and air conditioning 
are not expected to have significant large-scale impacts on 
air quality. The local impact of hydrocarbon and ammonia 
substitutes can be estimated by comparing the anticipated 
emission to local emissions from all sources. Small but not 
negligible impacts could occur near localized emission sources 
and such increases may be of concern, for instance, in areas 
that currently fail to meet local standards. [2.4 and 2.6]
Persistent degradation products of HFCs and HCFCs (such
as trifluoroacetic acid, TFA) are removed from the atmosphere 
via deposition and washout processes and TFA is toxic to 
some aquatic life at concentrations approaching 1 mg L–1. 
However, degradation of identified sources cannot account 
for the observed TFA abundances in the oceans, surface 
waters and atmosphere, indicating that there are larger 
natural sources of TFA. Current observations show typical 
concentrations in the ocean of about 0.2 μg L–1, while 
concentrations as high as 40 μg L–1 have been observed in 
the Dead Sea and Nevada lakes, suggesting a linkage to salt 
chemistry. Calculations based on projected HCFC and HFC 
emissions suggest that the concentration of TFA in rain-water 
due to their degradation is expected to be between 0.1  
μg L–1 and 0.5 μg L–1 in the year 2010. Thus increases to 
toxic levels of 1 mg L–1 in specific ecosystems resulting from 
use of halocarbons are not supported by current studies. [2.4]

Technical Summary
3.1 Where do GHG emissions occur that 
are related to the use of ODSs and their 
substitutes?
Ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and their substitutes 
are being used in a wide range of products and processes. 
Many of these substances (or byproducts released during 
manufacture) are greenhouse gases (GHGs), the emissions 
of which will result in a contribution to the direct positive 
forcing of the climate. Direct emissions of GHGs may occur 
during the manufacture of these substances, during their 
use in products and processes and at the end of the life of 
these products (see Figure TS-1). Banks are the total amount 
of substances contained in existing equipment, chemical 
stockpiles, foams and other products, which are not yet 
released to the atmosphere.
The indirect GHG emissions of applications of ODSs and 
their replacements are the GHG emissions related to the 
energy consumption (fuels and electricity) during the entire 
life cycle of the application7. This effect is different from 
the indirect negative radiative forcing of ODSs discussed in 
preceding sections. 
The UNFCCC addresses anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and the removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not 
controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and its Kyoto protocol 
regulates emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), 
nitrous oxide (N2O), HFCs, PFCs and sulphur hexafluoride 
(SF6). The Montreal Protocol, on the other hand, controls 
not the emission but rather the production and consumption 
of ODSs. Thus, the emissions due to releases of CFCs and 
HCFCs present in banks (e.g. refrigeration equipment, foams) 
are not covered by either the Montreal Protocol or Climate 
Convention and Kyoto Protocol. These emissions could make 
a significant future contribution to global warming. 
3.2 How are estimated banks and emissions 
projected to develop during the period 
2002 to 2015?
Current banks and emissions
Current emission profiles of ODSs and their substitutes are 
largely determined by historical use patterns, resulting in a 
relatively high contribution (at the present time and in the 
coming decades) from the CFCs and HCFCs banked in 
equipment and foams. Annual emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, 
HFCs and PFCs14 in 2002 were about 2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(see Table TS-415,16). Refrigeration applications together with 
stationary air conditioning (SAC) and mobile air conditioning 
(MAC) contribute the bulk of global direct GHG emissions. 
About 80% of the 2002 emissions are CFCs and HCFCs.
The banks stored in equipment and foams may leak during 
the use phase of the products they are part of and at the 
end of the product life cycle (if they are not recovered or 
destructed). The bank-turnover varies significantly from 
application to application: from months (e.g. solvents) to 
several years (refrigeration applications) to over half a century 
(foam insulation).
Banks of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs were estimated 
at about 21 GtCO2-eq (2002). CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs  
contribute about 16, 4 and 1 GtCO2-eq, respectively (see 
Table TS-5), while banks of PFCs used as ODS replacements 
contribute only about 0.005 GtCO2-eq. The build-up of 
the banks of (relatively) new applications of HFCs will 
significantly determine future (>2015) emissions without 
additional bank management measures.
3. Options for ODS phase-out and reducing GHG 
emissions
14 This concerns only emissions of HFCs and PFCs that result from their use as ODS-substitutes. Total emissions of HFCs and notably PFCs are higher because of 
emissions from other applications that are not within the scope of this report (e.g. emissions from aluminum production and the semiconductor industry).
15 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and banks expressed in terms of CO2-equivalents use GWPs for direct radiative forcing for a 100-year time horizon. Unless 
stated otherwise, the most recent scientific values for the GWPs are used, as assessed in this report and as presented in Table TS-3.
16 Halons cause much larger negative indirect radiative forcing than positive direct radiative forcing and, in the interest of clarity, their effects are not included in 
estimates of total emissions and banks expressed in MtCO2-equivalents.

Technical Summary
2015 Business-as-usual projections
The sector chapters have developed business-as-usual (BAU) 
projections for the use and emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, 
halons, HFCs and some PFCs (where these are used as 
replacements for ODSs). These projections have assumed that 
all existing measures will continue, including the Montreal 
Protocol (phase-out) and relevant national regulations. 
The usual practices and emission rates are kept unchanged 
up to 2015. End-of-life recovery efficiency is assumed not 
to increase. An overview of key assumptions for the BAU 
projections of 2015 is given in Table TS-6.

Technical Summary
The activities underlying the emissions of fluorocarbons 
are expected to grow significantly between 2002 and 2015. 
These activities and services (such as refrigeration, air 
conditioning and insulation) will be provided by a number 
of technologies and substances, including CFCs and HCFCs. 
In industrialized countries, the use and emissions of CFCs 
and HCFCs will decline following the Montreal Protocol 
phase-out requirement as obsolete equipment is retired. In 
developing countries, the production of HCFCs can continue 
until 2040, and significant increase in their production is 
expected. These changes, and their impacts, are reflected in 
the data in Table TS-4. [11.6]
The decline in CFC emissions is not accompanied by a 
similar increase in emissions of HFCs because of continuing 
trends towards non-HFC technology and substitutes with 
lower GWPs. In addition, but not included in the BAU 
scenario, the capture and safe disposal of substances that 
were emitted in the past are likely to increase with respect to 
HFCs since these substances are controlled under the Kyoto 
Protocol. The  BAU case assumes the continuing application 
of all existing measures, and the mitigation scenario embodies 
improvements that could be implemented assuming global 
application of current best-practice emission reduction 
techniques.
In the BAU scenario, banks are projected to decline to 18 
GtCO2-eq in 2015. CFC banks associated with refrigeration, 
SAC17 and MAC equipment are expected to fall from about 
6 GtCO2-eq in 2002 to 1 GtCO2-eq by 2015, mainly due 
to release to the atmosphere and partly due to end-of-life 
recovery and destruction. CFC banks in foams remain 
significant (decreasing from 10 to 7 GtCO2-eq over the 
same period). HCFC banks will increase from about 4 to 
5 GtCO2-eq, primarily due to the projected increase of 
HCFC-22 use in commercial refrigeration. Total HFC banks 
will start to build up to 5 GtCO2-eq in 2015. HFC banks 
in foams represent only 0.6 GtCO2-eq and are projected to 
increase further after 2015. [11.4 and 11.6]
In the BAU scenario, total direct emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, 
HFCs and PFCs are projected to represent about 2.3 GtCO2-
eq yr–1 by 2015 (as compared to about 2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 in 
2002)16: Combined CFC and HCFC emissions are decreasing 
from 2.1 (2002) to 1.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (2015), and emissions 
of HFCs are increasing from 0.4 (2002) to 1.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(2015)18. PFC emissions from ODS substitute use are about 
0.001 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (2002) and projected to decrease. 
Table TS-4 shows the relative contribution of sectors to global 
direct GHG emissions that are related to the use of ODSs 
and their substitutes. Refrigeration applications together with 
SAC and MAC contribute the bulk (77% in 2015 BAU) of 
global direct GHG emissions, which is in line with the higher 
emission rates associated with refrigerant banks. The largest 
part of GHG emissions from foams are expected to occur 
after 2015 because most releases occur at end-of-life.  
HFC-23 byproduct emissions account for 14% of all direct 
GHG emissions (2015 BAU).
Due to the leakage of CFCs from banks to the atmosphere, 
emissions of CFCs will decrease from 1.7 (2002) to 0.3 
GtCO2-eq (2015). HCFC emissions are projected to increase 
from 0.4 (2002) to 0.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (2015), owing to 
a steep increase in their use in (commercial) refrigeration 
and SAC applications. The projected threefold increase in 
HFC emissions is the result of the increased application of 
HFCs in the refrigeration, SAC and MAC sectors and due to 
byproduct emissions of HFC-23 from increased HCFC-22 
production. HCFC-22 production is projected to increase by 
about 40% over the 2002−2015 period. [11.4 and 11.6]
The literature does not allow for an estimate of overall 
indirect GHG emissions related to energy consumption. 
For individual applications, the relevance of indirect GHG 
emissions over a life cycle can range from low to high, and 
for certain applications may be up to an order of magnitude 
larger than direct GHG emissions. This is highly dependent 
on the specific sector and product/application characteristics, 
the carbon-intensity of the consumed electricity and fuels 
during the complete life cycle of the application, containment 
during the use-phase and the end-of-life treatment of the 
banked substances. Table TS-7 presents examples of the 
ranges found in the literature with respect to the proportion 
of direct emissions to total GHG emissions for applications 
using HFCs. For applications using other substances, these 
proportions may differ significantly. The relatively old 
vintage stock of refrigeration equipment using CFCs may, in 
particular, provide a larger share of direct emissions. [3.2, 4 
and 5] 
17 In this Technical Summary, the ‘refrigeration’ sector comprises domestic, commercial, industrial (including food processing and cold storage) and transportation 
refrigeration. [4] ‘Stationary air conditioning (SAC)’ comprises residential and commercial air conditioning and heating. [5] ‘Mobile air conditioning (MAC)’ 
applies to cars, buses and passenger compartments of trucks.
18 For these emission values the most recent scientific values for GWPs were used (see Table TS-3). If the UNFCCC GWPs would be used, reported HFC emissions 
(expressed in tonnes of CO2-eq) would be about 15% lower.

Technical Summary
2015 mitigation-scenario projections
Mitigation options are identified and described for each sector 
in the respective sector chapters. In Section 4 of this Technical 
Summary, more detailed information on sectoral reduction 
opportunities is given. On a more aggregated level, overall 
sector emission reduction potentials are determined for 2015 
relative to the BAU scenario. The estimates are based on a 
mitigation scenario, which assumes the global application of 
best practices in use, recovery and destruction of ODSs and 
ODS-substitutes. The scenario assumptions are presented 
in Table TS-6, and the sectoral GHG emissions in the 
mitigation scenario in 2015 are shown in Table TS-4. 
Through global application of best practices and recovery 
methods, about 1.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of direct GHG emissions 
can be reduced by 2015, as compared with the BAU scenario. 
About 60% of this potential is HFC emission reduction; 
HCFCs and CFCs contribute about 30% and 10%, 
respectively. Almost 75% of the reduction potential can be 
found in the refrigeration, SAC and MAC sectors, and about 
25% can be found in the destruction of HFC-23 byproduct 
emissions from HCFC-22 production. This latter option 
represents about 40% of the HFC-reduction potential. [11.6] 
Of the bank-related emissions that can be prevented during 
the period preceding 2015, the bulk is in refrigerant-based 
applications where BAU emission rates are considerably more 
significant than they are for foams during the same period. 
With earlier action, more of the CFC banks can be captured.
Most indirect energy-related GHG emissions occur during 
the use-phase of the applications and, in many cases, energy 
efficiency improvements can result in significant reductions 
in GHG emissions, particularly where the use-phase is long. 
Energy efficiency improvements can be profitable and reduce 
the net costs of the emission reduction options, although the 
reduction potential is again highly dependent on the specific 
circumstances. While the assessed literature did not allow 
for a global estimate of this reduction potential, several case 
studies at the technology and country level illustrate this 
point.
Uncertainties
Uncertainties in emission projections are significant. A 
comparison of atmospheric measurements with inventory 
calculations shows differences per group of substances (CFCs, 
HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs) in the order of 10−25%. For 
individual gases, the differences can be much bigger. These 
differences are caused by unidentified emissive applications of 
some substances (e.g. CFC-11, HCFC-141b, HCFC-142b) 
that are not accounted for in inventory calculations and by 
uncertainties in the geographically distributed data sets of 
equipment in use. [11.3.4]

3.3 Which options are available for reducing 
GHG emissions?
In general, technical options to reduce direct GHG emissions 
can be achieved through:
• improved containment of substances;
• reduced charge of substances in equipment and products; 
• end-of-life recovery and recycling or destruction of 
substances; 
• increased use of alternative substances with a reduced or 
negligible global-warming potential; 
• not-in-kind technologies.
Reductions of indirect GHG emissions can be achieved by 
improving the energy efficiency of products and processes 
(and by reducing the specific GHG emissions of the energy 
system). To determine which technology option has the 
highest GHG emission reduction potential, both direct and 
indirect emissions have to be assessed. The comparison of 
technology options is not a straightforward exercise as even 
within one technological application significant variations 
in direct and indirect emissions may occur. Figure TS-10 
shows the distribution of direct emissions from mobile 
air conditioners in a fleet of passenger cars and of indirect 
energy-related emissions from supermarket refrigerators. 
The graphs show that even within a single technology class 
considerable differences in potentials usually exist to reduce 
direct and/or indirect emissions. The proper monitoring, 
benchmarking and understanding of system performance 
will be a crucial first step in facilitating short- and mid-term 
emission reductions. However, to achieve major emission 
reductions in the long run, choices have to be made 
between the different established technology options and, 
consequently, there is a need to be prepared and informed by 
standardized environmental assessment tools.
3.4 Which assessment tools can provide 
information on technology choices?
The protection of the stratospheric ozone layer and climate 
requires the selection of technologies which differ with respect 
to their impacts on climate, on health, safety and other 
environmental endpoints and on their private and social costs. 
Analyses of these various impacts can assist decision-makers 
to choose among competing replacement technologies. 
However, the results of such analyses can vary, depending 
upon which of the many factors that are not intrinsic to the 
technologies are taken into consideration; these include the 
analytical approach (e.g. top-down compared with bottom-
up), degree of product or process optimization, service and 
disposal practices, regional circumstances and a wealth of 
other inputs and assumptions. To make intelligent choices, 
decision-makers must therefore be aware of the sensitivities, 
uncertainties and limitations inherent in each type of analysis 
and must also be able to evaluate whether the approach and 
assumptions used in an analysis are reasonable for the regions

Technical Summary
and time periods in which the competing technologies would 
be applied. 
To face such challenges, well-established and clearly described 
methodologies are needed. This report provides an overview 
of the different types of analyses and provides concise 
guidance on how to evaluate and apply them. For each 
type of analysis, the most important analytical approaches 
and variables are discussed, along with their sensitivities, 
uncertainties and limitations.
Any assessment of technical options to reduce the impacts 
of emissions involves the evaluation of multiple factors. 
These include the influence of direct and indirect emissions 
on radiative forcing, costs, health, safety and environmental 
impacts for each application and compound; service or 
design practices that can lead to reduced leakage; the effects 
of recovery and recycling. These factors may be subject to 
large uncertainties and differ from application to application 
and region to region. Non-technical factors also need to be 
considered, such as differing regulatory and management 
environments in different parts of the world, the availability 
of infrastructure, investment financing and historical factors. 
In many cases, only incomplete information on these factors 
is available, thereby limiting the comprehensiveness of the 
assessment.
This report deals with direct emissions of halocarbons that are 
associated with their production, use and decommissioning 
as well as indirect emissions due to energy requirements. 
Such emissions are quantified and costs associated with their 
reduction are evaluated according to methodologies presented 
herein. For a comprehensive assessment, not only private costs 
need to be quantified: also external costs that are not paid by 
the private sector but which are a burden to society should be 
accounted for.
The purpose of the methodologies chapter in this report 
(Chapter 3) is to describe procedures for quantifying both 
ODS and GHG emissions and the costs associated with 
reducing these emissions. A broad spectrum of assessment 
tools exists, ranging from tools with very well-established 
procedures applicable at global level to those loosely defined 
and not applied in a consistent manner. Table TS-8 provides 
an overview of methodologies identified as being relevant to 
this report.
In assessing environmental and climate change impacts, 
decision-makers prefer to have a comprehensive picture of 
all relevant environmental aspects. However, information 
other than that on direct and indirect GHG emissions is 
often difficult to quantify. Consequently, Total Equivalent 
Warming Impact (TEWI, a measure of GHG emissions 
during the use-phase and disposal) and Life Cycle Climate 
Performance (LCCP, which also includes the direct GHG 
emissions during manufacture and the indirect GHG 
emissions that are associated with the embodied energy of 
the substances of concern) have more practical value than 
more encompassing methodologies like Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA), Environmental Burden and others. It is worth noting 
that there is no scientifically established basis for reducing 
multiple impact results (like LCA) to a single overall score or 
number.
In the past, little attention was paid to ensure the 
comparability of results from different technology 
assessments. There is a wide range of available results on 
GHG performance from different assessments – often 
not comparable. The treatment of uncertainties is often 
incomplete, and resulting recommendations are not 
sufficiently robust to be compared across sectors. In the 
light of the many assumptions and different methodologies, 
an important role has been identified for technology 
comparisons under agreed conditions using a common set of 
methods and assumptions. The development of simple and 
pragmatic standard methodologies and their respective quality 
criteria is recommended. Future work will need to bridge 
the gap between the application of specific comparisons and 
sufficiently robust results that can be used for policy design in 
entire subsectors. 
Analyses of sectoral and global emissions and emission 
reduction potentials are based on extensive databases on 
equipment populations and other product distributions 
that comprise field data on substance emissions and 
energy consumption. These databases should ideally be 
consistent and compatible with national GHG emission 
inventories. Information on fluid sales to the different 
parties involved in the subsector will need to be made 
available. The improvement of these fairly comprehensive 
data sets for analysis in support of robust sectoral policies 
requires significant resources and results in a number of 
confidentiality issues which need to be addressed cautiously. 
To achieve acceptability across subsectors with respect to 
future developments, decision-makers could consider paying 
special attention to increasing the involvement of relevant 
stakeholders and to introducing additional measures in order 
to increase transparency for outside users through more 
extensive documentation of methods and assumptions.

 Methodology to assess 
Overview
    Direct emissions 
 Production  
1) Identification of all feedstock requirements and chemical processing stages necessary to  
 
 
 
 
 transform feedstock to intermediaries and final product. 
 
  
2) Accounting for all emissions occurring at each stage through measurement and/or modelling. 
 Use 
1) Measurements to estimate losses of fluids during lifetime of equipment, which yield direct emissions.  
 
 
2) Transportation and distribution losses are included as direct use emissions.
 Decommissioning 
1) Emissions are accounted for based on the final destination of the products. 
 
  
2) If no recovery, all remaining fluids are assumed to be direct emissions. 
 
  
3) If recovered, emissions may also occur during fluid reprocessing.
    Indirect emissions 
 Production 
1) Modelling and/or measurement of built-in energy in equipment used for feedstock sourcing,  
 
 
 
 preprocessing, transport and transformation to final product in the plants.
 
  
2) Modelling and/or measurements of total energy consumption to produce one unit of a particular  
 
 
 fluid from feedstocks. 
 
  
3) Relating energy consumption to emission of GHGs through region- or country-specific data.

2) Relating energy consumption to emission of GHGs through region- or country-specific data.
    Costs 
 Private costs 
Costs are calculated based on expertise of private companies. These mainly include capital costs,  
 
 
 
labour, land, materials, maintenance and administrative costs.
 Social costs 
Costs usually charged to society, such as air and water pollution, associated with production of goods  
 
 
 
by private sectors. Costs are estimated through the quantification of benefits and damages induced by  
 
 
 
final product.
 Discount rates 
Use this to consider different time distribution of costs incurred. Present value or levelized cost is  
 
 
 
evaluated taking into consideration market or social discount rates for private or social costs, respectively.
 Sustainable development 
Quantification, or at least qualification, of positive and negative impacts caused on a society’s well- 
 
 
 
being by changes in production and use of fluids.
    Health and safety 
 Health and safety 
1) Focus on risk assessment of chemicals and then minimising the negative health and safety impacts  
 
 
 
 through risk management of systems.
 
  
2) For relevant substances use the references to existing databases and data sources.

Technical Summary
3.5 What are regional differences?
Difference in economic development is a very important 
factor explaining regional differences in assessments. Key 
assumptions on technical performance indicators, such as 
equipment lifetime and operational cost of equipment and 
products, vary greatly from developed to developing countries 
in ways that seem to be related with the cost of capital.
In developing countries, traditional private costs are usually 
accounted for, while other hidden private costs (e.g. for 
Research and Development (R&D), training, environmental 
liability) are seldom considered. External costs are generally 
poorly accounted for because there are usually no regulations 
in place to deal with externality issues and the awareness 
amongst the population is low. On-site health and safety 
regulations are usually taken into consideration due to the 
existence and enforcement of labour laws in most developing 
countries.
Between developed and developing countries significant 
variations can also be found with respect to the uncertainty 
range of their emission estimates (both direct and indirect 
emissions), which in turn are used as input for further 
analysis. In the case of direct emissions, some progress 
has been made in the diffusion of emission inventory 
methodologies under the Montreal Protocol Multilateral 
Fund investments in developing countries. However, for 
both developed and developing countries, uncertainties are 
generally significant. Improving the quantification of indirect 
GHG emissions, which are significant relative to total GHG 
emissions, remains a challenge for all countries. Difficulties 
centre around such issues as data availability on energy 
consumption, determination of the carbon intensity of the 
energy consumed and the GHG emission estimates related to 
the embodied energy in production inputs. These challenges 
point to the necessity for a concerted global effort if decision-
makers are to be provided with the information needed to 
make decisions supportive of global ozone layer and climate 
policies. 
The above challenges are compounded by the fact that each 
technology that results in direct or indirect emissions has 
unique data requirements for determining their climate 
and ozone impacts. This situation raises issues of capacity, 
standards, policy and regulation, for which developed 
countries have established better, though not comprehensive, 
frameworks within which to respond. This emphasizes the 
need to develop simple, standard methodologies and the 
respective quality criteria, as recommended in the report.

3.6 What major opportunities have been 
identified for reducing GHG emissions 
associated with the use of ODSs, 
their substitutes and related indirect 
emissions?
The major opportunities for reducing direct emissions in 
terms per sector and per substance group are quantified in 
Table TS-4. Table TS-9 summarizes the sector characteristics 
and specific mitigation opportunities. In Section 4 of this

emissions are discussed in more detail.

Opportunities for emissions reduction
 
 
 
 
• HFC-134a and isobutane (HC-600a) are the primary alternative refrigerants for the previously  
 
 
 
 
 
used CFC-12. Each has demonstrated a mass production capability for safe, efficient, reliable and  
 
 
 
 
 
economic use. The choice of HFC-134a or HC-600a varies per region and is strongly influenced by  
 
 
 
 
 
the regulatory environment and liability. 
 
 
 
 
• For both refrigerants, indirect emissions dominate total emissions, almost without taking the carbon  
 
 
 
 
 
intensity of electric power generation into consideration. At equal energy efficiencies, HC-600a  
 
 
 
 
 
domestic refrigerators have a better LCCP, with or without end-of-life recovery. The difference with  
 
 
 
 
 
HFC-134a is small, and end-of-life recovery can further reduce the magnitude of the difference.

the range of 3−22%, with an average of 18%.
 
 
 
 
• In 2002, all refrigerant types banked in commercial refrigeration equipment − predominantly CFCs, 
 
 
 
 
 
HCFCs and HFCs − represented 606 ktonnes of a total of 2691 ktonnes for all refrigerating and air

• The projected emissions by 2015 in this subsector are about 902 MtCO2-eq yr–1 in the BAU-scenario.
 
 
 
Opportunities for emissions reduction
 
 
 
 
• Significant total emission reductions, that is improved LCCP, can be achieved by using refrigerants  
 
 
 
 
 
HFCs, hydrocarbons, ammonia or CO2, employing charge reduction, more efficient containment and   
 
 
 
 
overall improved energy efficiency through new system designs. 
 
 
 
 
• In full supermarket systems, LCCP values up to 60% lower than centralized direct systems of  
 
 
 
 
 
traditional design can be obtained by applying direct systems using alterative refrigerants, better  
 
 
 
 
 
containment, distributed systems, indirect systems or cascade systems. Published results show  
 
 
 
 
 
alternatives to have 0−35% higher initial cost and an energy usage 0−20% higher than that of current   
 
 
 
 
systems. 
 
 
 
 
• Refrigerant emissions abatement cost was found to be in the range of 20−280 US$ per tCO2-eq (10%   
 
 
 
 
yr–1 discount rate). Development work on new systems is continuing to reduce cost and energy usage   
 
 
 
 
in these systems. This will further reduce the abatement costs. Taking a possible increase in energy  
 
 
 
 
 
efficiency into consideration may also result in negative abatement costs (savings).
 
 
 
 
• For small commercial units, namely stand-alone equipment and condensing units (vending   
 
 
 
 
 
machines, ice-cream freezers, walk-in coolers, etc.), global companies have begun employing low- or   
 
 
 
 
zero-GWP alternatives to HFCs (hydrocarbons and CO2) and alternative technologies, which promise

Technical Summary
3.7 Which policy instruments are available 
to achieve the reductions in the 
emissions of GHGs addressed in this 
report? 
As discussed in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, a wide 
range of policies, measures and instruments can be used to 
reduce GHG emissions. These include:
• regulations (e.g. mandatory technology and performance 
standards; product bans);
• financial incentives (e.g. taxes on emissions, production, 
import or consumption; subsidies and direct government 
spending and investment; deposit-refund systems; tradable 
and non-tradable permits); 
• voluntary agreements. 
Almost all of the policy instrument categories mentioned 
above have been considered for, or implemented in, reducing 
the use or emissions of ODSs and their substitutes, such as 
HFCs and PFCs. Furthermore, general energy or climate 
policies affect the indirect GHG emissions of applications 
with ODSs, their substitutes or not-in-kind alternatives. In 
addition, specific policies for reducing the GHG emissions of 
ODS substitutes (i.e. HFCs and PFCs) have been formulated. 
Examples are given in Table TS-10.
3.8 What can be said about the future 
availability of HFCs/PFCs for use in 
developing countries?
No published data are available to project future production 
capacity. However, as there are no technical or legal limits 
to HFC and PFC production, it can be assumed that the 
global production capacity will generally continue to satisfy or 
exceed demand. Future production is therefore estimated in 
this report by aggregating sectoral demand. 
In the BAU scenario, global production capacity is expected 
to expand with additions taking place mainly in developing 
countries and through joint ventures. Global production 
capacity of HFCs and PFCs most often exceeds current 
demand. There are a number of HFC-134a plants in 
developed countries and one plant in a developing country 
with others planned; the few plants for other HFCs are 
almost exclusively in developed countries. The proposed 
European Community phase-out of HFC-134a in mobile 
air conditioners in new cars and the industry voluntary 
programme to reduce their HFC-134a emissions by 50% will 
affect demand and production capacity and output. Rapidly 
expanding markets in developing countries, in particular 
for replacements for CFCs, is resulting in new capacity for 
fluorinated gases which is at present being satisfied through 
the expansion of HCFC-22 and 141b capacity. [11]

 Type of instrument Specific instrument examples
 Regulations 
Mandatory performance standards:
 
Energy-efficiency performance standards and leak-tightness performance standards are in place in several countries,  
 
notably for refrigeration and cooling applications. Regulations that prohibit venting and require recycling have 
 
been enacted in many countries but are often difficult to enforce. Effective application requires complementary  
 
 
compliance programmes and mandatory training of technicians. Vehicle emission performance standards (e.g.  
 
 
restriction of the amount of  GHGs emitted by cars, including both fuel and MAC emissions) are being considered   
 
(e.g. by the State of California). 
 
Obligation to use certified companies for servicing of installations and equipment (e.g. ‘STEK’ programme in the   
 
Netherlands). 
 
Bans and restrictions on the use of specific substances for certain applications: HFCs phase-out schemes are in place  
 
or proposed in several countries (e.g. Austria, Denmark, Switzerland). The proposed EU Directive aims to amend the  
 
existing EU Vehicle Type Approval legislation which will introduce a GWP threshold for HFCs used in MAC. 
 
End-of-life management measures, such as mandatory recycling and bans on venting
 Financial incentives  The relative costs of HFCs/PFCs and other alternatives to ODSs will impact the choices of both the users and the   
 and market  
producers of these substances. HFCs and PFCs are complex chemicals, and they tend to be more expensive than 
 mechanisms 
the ODSs they replace, thus further encouraging the substitution to not-in-kind alternatives. Financial incentives 
  
 
can further shape this cost differential between substances and technologies. 
 
Deposits or taxes on HFC import and production are collected by several countries. Deposits and taxes raise the cost  
 
of HFCs, encouraging containment and making recycling more attractive. 
 
Tax rebates for delivery of used HFCs and PFCs to destruction facilities provide incentives to minimize emissions. In  
 
Norway rebates are NKr 183 (26 US$) per tCO2-eq 
 
Subsidies: In addition to the international grants from the Multilateral Fund under the Montreal Protocol and, for   
 
example, the Global Environment Facility, national governments subsidize research and development as well as the  
 
implementation of new, low-GHG emission technologies.
 
Subsidy (50%) on the cost of collection and destruction of halons and CFCs was provided in the Netherlands to  
 
 
discourage venting, just before stocks of these substances became illegal in 2004. 
 
Emission reduction of HFCs and PFCs can be funded by the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto   
 
Protocol. CDM projects exist for Korea and China and are under development for India and Mexico. 
 
Large point sources of HFCs may be included in emission trading schemes. To date, these sources (e.g. the 
 
HFC-23 byproduct emissions of HCFC-22 production) have not usually been included in emissions trading schemes,
  
although the UK scheme is a notable exception. Monitoring the use and emissions of such substances may be less 
 
practical for the more diffuse emission sources.
 
 Voluntary  
There are several industry- and government-sponsored emission reduction and responsible use programmes.  
 
 agreements 
Adherence to responsible use principles can lead to reductions in HFC emissions beyond current projections.  
 
 
Principles for responsible use include:
 
 
• Use HFCs only in applications where they provide safety, energy efficiency, environmental or critical economic or  
 
 public health advantage;
 
 
• Limit emissions of HFCs to the lowest practical level during manufacture, use and disposal of equipment and  
 
 
 products; 
 
 
• If HFCs are to be used, select the compound or system with the smaller climate impact that satisfies the application  
 
 requirements. 
 
 
Good practice guidelines have been developed regarding the selection and maintenance of equipment, including  
 
 
improved containment of substances and recovery during servicing and at the end-of-life.

Technical Summary
4.1 What are the most important findings 
for the refrigeration sector?
Refrigerants are by far the largest contributors to direct 
emissions of GHGs. In this report, the refrigeration sector is 
classified into the following subsectors: domestic refrigeration, 
commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and food 
processing and cold storage and transport refrigeration. 
The sectors residential and commercial air conditioning 
and heating (SAC) and mobile air conditioning (MAC) are 
presented in separate sections (4.2 and 4.3) in this Technical 
Summary. Table TS-11 presents a detailed breakdown of 
banks and direct emissions of GHGs over all these sectors 
utilizing refrigerants.
The five general options to reduce direct GHG emissions for 
the refrigeration sector can be specified as follows:
• improved containment: leak-tight systems;
• recovery, recycling and the destruction of refrigerants 
during servicing and at the end-of-life of the equipment;
• application of reduced charge systems:
• lower refrigerant charge per unit of cooling capacity;
• reduced refrigeration capacity demand;
• use of alternative refrigerants with a reduced or negligible 
global-warming potential (e.g. hydrocarbons (HCs), 
carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia, etc.); 
• not-in-kind technologies.
These principles equally apply for the SAC and MAC sectors.
4.1.1 Domestic refrigeration
Domestic refrigerators and freezers are used for food storage 
in dwelling units and in non-commercial areas such as 
offices throughout the world. More than 80 million units are 
produced annually with internal storage capacities ranging 
from 20 litres to more than 850 litres. With an estimated 
unit average lifespan of 20 years, this results in an installed 
inventory of approximately 1500 million units. As a result of 
the Montreal Protocol, manufacturers initiated the transition 
from CFC refrigerant applications during the early 1990s. 
This transition is complete in developed countries and has 
made significant progress in developing countries. However, 
the typical lifespan of domestic refrigerators results in units 
manufactured using CFC-12 refrigerant still comprising the 
majority of the installed base. This in turn significantly retards 
the rate of reduction in the demand for CFC-12 refrigerant in 
the servicing sector. 
Isobutane (HC-600a) and HFC-134a are the major 
alternative refrigerants replacing CFC-12 in new domestic 
refrigeration equipment (see Table TS-12). Each of these has 
demonstrated mass production capability for safe, efficient, 
reliable and economic use. Similar product efficiencies result 
from the use of either refrigerant. Independent studies have 
concluded that application design parameters introduce 
more efficiency variation than is presented by the refrigerant 
choice. Comprehensive refrigerant selection criteria include 
safety, environmental, functional, cost and performance 
requirements. The choice of refrigerant can be strongly 
influenced by local regulatory and litigation environments. 
Each refrigerator typically contains 50−250 g of refrigerant 
enclosed in a factory-sealed hermetic system. A simplified 
summary of relative technical considerations for these two 
refrigerants is:
• HC-600a uses historically familiar mineral oil as the 
lubricant in the hermetic system. Manufacturing processes 
and designs must properly deal with the flammable 
nature of this refrigerant. Among these are the need 
for proper factory ventilation and appropriate electrical 
equipment, prevention of refrigerant leakage and access 
to electrical components, use of sealed or non-sparking 
electrical components when there is accessibility to leaking 
refrigerant and the use of proper brazing techniques or, 
preferably, avoidance of brazing operations on charged 
systems. Field service procedures must also properly 
accommodate the refrigerant flammability.
• HFC-134a uses moisture-sensitive polyolester oil as the 
lubricant in the hermetic system. Manufacturing processes 
and service procedures must take care to properly maintain 
low moisture levels. Long-term reliability requires a more 
careful avoidance of contaminants during production 
or servicing compared to either CFC-12 or HC-600a 
practices.
The use of the hydrocarbon blend propane (HC-290)/
isobutane (HC-600a) allows the matching of CFC-12 
volumetric capacity and avoids capital expense for retooling 
compressors. These blends introduce manufacturing 
complexities and require the use of charging techniques 
suitable for refrigerant blends having components with 
different boiling points. Application of these blends in 
Europe during the 1990s was an interim step towards the 
transition to HC-600a using retooled compressors. The safety 
considerations for hydrocarbon blends are consistent with 
those for HC-600a.

Technical Summary
Alternative refrigeration technologies such as the Stirling 
cycle, absorption cycle and thermoelectric, thermionic and 
thermoacoustic systems continue to be pursued for special 
applications or situations with primary drivers different from 
conventional domestic refrigerators. These technology options 
are not expected to significantly alter the position of vapour 
compression technology as the technology of choice for 
domestic refrigeration in the foreseeable future.
Vapour compression technology is established and readily 
available worldwide. Current technology designs, based on 
HC-600a or HFC-134a, typically use less than one-half the 
electrical energy required by the units they replace. This 
reliable performance is provided without resorting to higher 
cost or more complex designs. Continued incremental 
improvements in unit performance and/or energy efficiency 
are anticipated. Government regulations and voluntary 
agreements on energy efficiency and labelling programmes 
have demonstrated their effectiveness in driving improved 
efficiency product offerings in several countries.
Good design, manufacturing and service practices will 
minimize refrigerant emissions during refrigerator production 
and use phases; however, special attention must be given to 
the retirement of the large number of units containing CFC-
12. With a typical 20-year lifespan, refrigerator end-of-life 
retirement and disposal occurs at a frequency of about 5% 
of the installed base each year. This means approximately 75 
million refrigerators containing 100 g per unit, or a total of 
7500 tonnes of refrigerant, are disposed of annually. For at 
least another 10 years, this refrigerant will predominantly be 
CFC-12. The small refrigerant charge per unit detracts from 
the economic justification for refrigerant recovery. Regulating 
agencies around the world have provided incentives or non-
compliance penalties to promote recovery of this ODS. 
The current (2002 data) annualized HFC-134a emissions rate 
from domestic refrigerators is 1.0% during product usage. 
HFC emissions for domestic refrigeration are estimated to be 
480 tonnes in 2002, increasing to 7800 tonnes by 2015 in a 
BAU scenario. In the mitigation-scenario, emissions in 2015 
are 2800 tonnes due to improved refrigerant containment 
and recovery. Table TS-12 summarizes emission abatement 
opportunities with increased application of HC-600a 
refrigerant. Similarly, the manufacturing cost premiums 
and capital investments and development costs required for 
implementation are tabulated for the three most common 
refrigerator configurations. 
4.1.2 Commercial refrigeration 
Commercial refrigeration comprises three main types of 
equipment: stand-alone equipment, condensing units and 
full supermarket systems. A wide variety of refrigeration 
systems fall within the subsector of commercial refrigeration, 
from ice-cream freezers, with a cooling capacity of about 
200 W and not varying greatly from domestic freezers, up to 
machinery rooms containing multiple compressor racks that

Technical Summary
consume several hundreds of kilowatts. The most commonly 
used refrigerants in this subsector are HCFC-22, R-404A and 
HFC-134a.
In 2002, all refrigerant types banked in commercial 
refrigeration, predominantly equipment containing CFCs, 
HCFCs and HFCs, represented 605 kt of a total of 2690 kt 
for all refrigerating and air conditioning (AC) systems and all 
refrigerant types; this represents 22% of the total refrigeration 
and AC bank.
On a global basis, commercial refrigeration is the refrigeration 
subsector with the largest refrigerant emissions, calculated as 
CO2-equivalents, representing 40% of the total refrigerant 
emissions (in refrigeration, SAC and MAC). The emission 
levels, including fugitive emissions, ruptures and emissions 
during servicing and at end-of-life, are generally very high, 
especially for supermarkets and hypermarkets. The larger the 
charge, the larger the average emission rate, which results 
from very long pipes, large numbers of fittings and valves and 
very high emissions when ruptures occur. 
Refrigerant leakage rates derived with a bottom-up approach 
suggest a global annual emissions rate of 30% of banked 
system charge. Refrigerant emissions typically represent 60% 
of the total emissions of GHGs resulting from the system 
operation, with the remainder being indirect emissions 
caused by power production. These percentages indicate how 
important emission reductions from this sector are.
Annual refrigerant leakage rate data from over 1700 full 
supermarket systems in the USA and Europe are in the range 
of 3−22% of system charge, with an average of 18%. It may 
be concluded that if the emission estimate of 30% on a global 
basis is correct, the values of 3−22% must represent selected 
company data from countries with a strong emphasis on 
emission reductions.
Projections of future halocarbon refrigerant emissions 
according to different scenarios are given in Table TS-11. 
The high economic growth rates of some of the developing 
countries will have a very significant impact on the growth of 
the refrigerant bank and emissions. 
Significant total emission reductions, that is improved 
LCCP, can be achieved by using refrigerants like HFCs, 
hydrocarbons, ammonia or CO2, by employing charge 
reduction and more efficient containment and by overall 
improved energy efficiency through new system designs. 
This is summarized in Table TS-13. Safety issues have to 
be taken into account if toxic or flammable refrigerants are 
used; these depend on national and, occasionally, on local 
regulations, which may limit the degree to which some of 
these refrigerants can be applied.
In full supermarket systems, up to 60% lower LCCP values 
than in centralized direct systems of traditional design can 
be obtained by applying direct systems using alternative 
refrigerants, better containment, distributed systems, indirect 
systems or cascade systems. 
Published results show that alternative systems have a 0−35% 
higher initial cost and a 0−20% higher energy usage than 
current systems. 
Refrigerant emissions abatement cost is in the range of 
20−280 US$/tCO2-eq19,20. Development work on new 
systems is continuing in order to reduce cost and energy 
usage in these systems, which will further reduce abatement 
costs. Taking into consideration possible increases in energy 
efficiency may also result in negative abatement costs 
(savings).
For small commercial units, namely stand-alone equipment 
and condensing units (vending machines, ice-cream 
freezers, walk-in coolers, etc.), global companies have 
begun employing low- or zero-GWP alternatives to HFCs 
(hydrocarbons and CO2) and alternative technologies. Both of 
these options promise reduced direct and comparable or lower 
indirect emissions.
4.1.3 Food processing, cold storage and industrial 
refrigeration
Food processing and cold storage is one of the important 
applications of refrigeration; the preservation and distribution 
of food while keeping nutrients intact. This application is very 
significant in size and economic importance in all countries, 
including developing ones. The application includes both 
cold storage (at temperatures from −1°C to 10°C), freezing  
(−30°C to −35°C) and the long-term storage of frozen 
products (−20°C to −30°C). The amount of chilled food 
is about 10 to 12 times greater than the amount of frozen 
products. 
19 Costs in this report are given in US dollars in 2002 unless otherwise stated.
20 The presented cost data are for direct emission reductions only. The taking into account of energy efficiency improvements may result in even net negative specific 
costs (savings).

Technical Summary
The majority of refrigerating systems for food processing 
and cold storage are based on reciprocating and screw 
compressors. Ammonia, HCFC-22, R-502 and CFC-12 
are the historically used refrigerants. HFC refrigerants are 
currently being used in place of CFC-12, R-502 and HCFC-
22 in certain regions. The preferred HFCs are HFC-134a and 
HFC blends with a small temperature glide such as R-404A, 
R-507A and R-410A. Ammonia/CO2 cascade systems are

also being used, as are hydrocarbons as primary refrigerants in 
indirect systems.
Limited data are available on TEWI/LCCP for this category. 
A recent study of system performance and LCCP calculations 
for an 11-kW refrigeration system operating with R-404A, 
R-410A and HC-290 showed negligible differences in LCCP, 
based on the assumptions used in the calculations.
Additional information on refrigerant leakage and emissions 
reduction options for the total sector of food processing, cold 
storage and industrial refrigeration is included at the end of 
the following section. 
Industrial refrigeration includes a wide range of cooling 
and freezing applications, such as those in the chemical, oil 
and gas industries, industrial and recreational ice making 
and air liquefaction. Most systems are vapour compression 
cycles, with evaporator temperatures ranging from 15°C 
down to −70°C. Cryogenic applications operate at even lower 
temperatures. The capacity of the units varies from 25 kW 
to 30 MW, with systems often custom-made and erected on-
site. The refrigerants used are preferably single component 
or azeotropes because many of the systems use flooded 
evaporators to achieve high efficiency. Some designs use 
indirect systems with heat transfer fluids to reduce refrigerant 
charge size and/or to minimize the risk of direct contact with 
the refrigerant. 
These refrigeration systems are normally located in industrial 
areas with limited public access. Ammonia is the predominant 
and increasingly used refrigerant, with the second most 
common refrigerant in terms of volume use being HCFC-22, 
although the use of HCFC-22 in new systems is forbidden 
by European regulations since January 2001 for all types of 
refrigerating equipment. The smaller volume CFC refrigerants 
CFC-12 and R-502 are being replaced by HFC-134a and by 
R-404A, R-507A and R-410A. CFC-13 and R-503 are being 
replaced by HFC-23 and by R-508A or R-508B. HCFC-22 is 
being replaced by R-410A, as the energy efficiency of R-410A 
systems can be slightly higher than that of HCFC-22, and 
R-410A is similar to ammonia with respect to evaporation 
temperatures down to −40°C. Hydrocarbon refrigerants 
historically have been used in large refrigeration plants within 
the oil and gas industry. 
CO2 is beginning to find application in this subsector as a 
low-temperature refrigerant and in cascade systems, with 
ammonia in the high stage and CO2 in the low stage. The 
energy efficiency of CO2 systems can be similar to that of 
HCFC-22, ammonia and R-410A in the evaporator range of 
–40°C to –50°C. CO2 is also being used as an indirect system 
heat transfer fluid. 
Annual refrigerant leakage rates of industrial refrigeration 
systems have been estimated to be in the range of 7−10%, 
while those for the combined sector of food processing, cold 
storage and industrial refrigeration were reported to be 17% 
of the total systems refrigerant bank in 2002. The refrigerant 
bank consisted of 35% ammonia and 43% HCFC-22 
by weight, with the remainder being CFCs, HFCs and 
hydrocarbons. The 2002 distribution of the major refrigerants 
and emissions in this total sector are shown in Table TS-14.
Emission reduction options are to use refrigerants with 
lower GWP, to improve design of equipment and operations 
resulting in a reduced system refrigerant charge, to improve 
refrigerant containment and recovery and to improve energy 
efficiency through new system designs. LCCP calculations 
should be used in optimizing refrigerant choice and system 
design for the lowest environmental impact. Industrial 
refrigeration refrigerant emissions abatement cost was 
determined to be in the range of 27−37 US$/tCO2-eq (8% 
yr–1 discount rate).
4.1.4 Transport refrigeration
The transport refrigeration subsector consists of refrigeration 
systems for transporting chilled or frozen goods by road, rail, 
air and sea. Several types of refrigeration configurations are 
used, such as shipboard systems, containers with individual 
refrigeration units which can be transported by sea, rail 
or road and refrigerated trucks and railcars. The transport 
subsector also covers the use of refrigeration in fishing

Technical Summary
vessels where the refrigeration systems are used for both food 
processing and storage.
Technical requirements for transport refrigeration units 
are more stringent than for many other applications of 
refrigeration. The equipment has to operate in a wide range 
of ambient temperatures and under extremely variable 
weather conditions (solar radiation, rain, etc). The transport 
equipment must be able to carry a highly diverse range of 
cargoes with differing temperature requirements and must be 
robust and reliable in the often severe transport environment. 
Despite the robust and sturdy design of transport refrigeration 
units, leaks within the refrigeration system can occur as a 
result of vibrations, sudden shocks, collisions with other 
objects and salt-water corrosion. Ensuring the safe operation 
with all working fluids is essential if − for example, in the 
case of ships − there are no easy options for evacuation in the 
case of refrigerant leakage. Safety must be inherent through 
the choice of fluids or ensured through a number of technical 
measures. There is also a need for continuity with respect 
to equipment maintenance, as the transport equipment can 
require servicing in many locations around the world.
Refrigeration systems are typically using CFC-12, R-502, 
HCFC-22, HFC-134a, R-404A, R-507A, R-410A and 
R-407C. Lower GWP alternatives, such as ammonia, 
hydrocarbons and ammonia/CO2, have been commercialized 
in some vapour compression applications. Ice and liquid or

Technical Summary
solid CO2 are used in some sectors of transport refrigeration 
such as road, rail and air. An overview of the different 
applications currently used as well as the state of development 
of alternatives can be found in Table TS-15. The refrigerant 
bank is presently estimated to be 3300 tonnes of CFCs, 3200 
tonnes of HCFC-22 and 9500 tonnes of HFCs and HFC 
mixtures; the total bank is expected to increase from 16,000 
tonnes at the present time to 23,200 tonnes in 2015 (BAU 
scenario). The expectation is that present-day combined 
refrigerant emissions of 6000 tonnes annually will increase to 
8700 tonnes annually by 2015 for a BAU scenario or will be 
5250 tonnes annually following significantly increased efforts 
in refrigerant recovery and recycling and better containment 
such as the use of hermetically sealed compressors. These 
latter options would significantly lower CO2-equivalent 
emissions, as would the replacement of fluorocarbons with 
lower GWP alternatives. 
There are lower-GWP refrigerant replacement options 
available for all transport refrigeration applications where 
CFCs, HCFCs or HFCs are presently being used; see Table 
TS-15. In several cases, these options might increase the costs 
of the refrigeration system due to equipment- and safety-
related costs. It must be remembered that for the owners 
of transport equipment, and in the absence of external 
incentives, the initial cost of the transport system and 
refrigeration plant is far more important than the running 
costs of the installation.
Due to refrigerant leakage rates of 25−35%, the change 
from an HFC such as R-404A to a lower GWP alternative 
will usually lead to a reduction of the TEWI, if the energy 
consumption is not substantially higher than in today’s 
systems. In several applications, the reduction of TEWI could 
be very significant.
There are many opportunities for reducing the energy 
consumption of transport refrigeration systems, including 
improved insulation to reduce cooling losses and load, 
compressor frequency control for partial load conditions, 
water-cooled condensers for shipboard systems and preventive 
maintenance to reduce heat exchanger fouling.
4.2 What are the most important findings 
for residential and commercial air 
conditioning and heating?
The applications, equipment and products that are included 
in the sector of residential and commercial air conditioning 
and heating can be classified into three groups: stationary air 
conditioners (including both equipment that cools air and 
heat pumps that directly heat air), chillers and water-heating 
heat pumps. 
Stationary air conditioners generally fall into six distinct 
categories: (1) window-mounted and through-the-wall; (2) 
non-ducted split residential and commercial; (3) non-ducted 
single-package; (4) non-ducted water-source; (5) ducted 
residential split and single packaged; (6) ducted commercial 
split and packaged. Water chillers coupled with air handling 
and distribution systems commonly provide comfort air 
conditioning in large commercial buildings. Water-heating 
heat pumps are manufactured using various heat sources: air, 
water from ponds and rivers and the ground.
Which refrigerants were used in the past? 
• HCFC-22 in unitary air conditioners;
• HCFC-22 and R-502 in water-heating heat pumps;
• CFC-11, CFC-12, HCFC-22 and R-500 in centrifugal 
water chillers;
• HCFC-22 and CFC-12 (to a much lower extent) in 
positive displacement water chillers.
Stationary air conditioners: The vast majority of stationary 
air conditioners (and air-heating heat pumps) use the vapour-
compression cycle technology with HCFC-22 refrigerant. 
Nearly all air-cooled air conditioners manufactured prior to 
2000 use this refrigerant as their working fluid. 
Water chillers: Chillers employing screw, scroll and 
reciprocating compressors generally employ HCFC-22. Some 
of the smaller reciprocating chillers (under 100 kW) were 
offered with CFC-12 as the refrigerant. Centrifugal chillers 
are manufactured in the United States, Asia and Europe. Prior 
to 1993, these chillers were offered with CFC-11, CFC-12, 
R-500 and HCFC-22 as refrigerants. 
Water-heating heat pumps: In the past, the most common 
refrigerants for vapour compression heat pumps have been   
R-502 and HCFC-22.
What are current practices?
Stationary air conditioners: A rough estimate would indicate 
that globally more than 90% of the air-cooled air conditioner 
(and heat pump) units currently being produced still use 
HCFC-22 as the refrigerant. This refrigerant is beginning 
to be phased out in some countries ahead of the schedule 
dictated by the Montreal Protocol. The refrigerant options 
being used to replace HCFC-22 are the same for all of the 
stationary air conditioner categories: HFC-134a, HFC blends 
and hydrocarbons. CO2 is also being considered for this 
application. At present, HFC blends are being used in the vast 
majority of non-ODS systems, with hydrocarbons being used 
in a small percentage of low charge systems.

Technical Summary
Water chillers: HFCs and HFC blends (particularly R-407C 
and R-410A) are beginning to replace HCFC-22 unit sales 
in new positive displacement chillers. Larger water-cooled 
screw chillers (e.g. above 350 kW) have been developed to use 
HFC-134a rather than HCFC-22. Ammonia is used in some 
chillers in Europe, and a few small chillers using hydrocarbon 
refrigerants are also produced there each year. HCFC-123 and 
HFC-134a have replaced CFC-11 and CFC-12 in centrifugal 
chillers produced since 1993.
Water-heating heat pumps: In developed countries, HCFC-
22 is still the most commonly used refrigerant, but HFC 
alternatives are being introduced. In developing countries, 
CFC-12 is also still used to a limited extent. Alternatives 
to HFCs in small residential and commercial water-heating 
systems include hydrocarbons and CO2. Hydrocarbons are 
being used in Europe and CO2 is being used in Europe and 
Asia.
What are possible future trends?
Options to reduce GHG emissions in residential and 
commercial air conditioning and heating equipment involve 
containment in CFC/HCFC/HFC vapour-compression 
systems that are applicable worldwide and for all equipment, 
and the use of non-CFC/HCFC/HFC systems. This latter 
option is not applicable in all instances due to economic, 
safety and energy efficiency considerations.
Containment can be achieved through the improved design, 
installation and maintenance of systems to reduce leakage and 
minimize refrigerant charge quantities in the systems, and 
the recovery, recycling and reclaiming of refrigerant during 
servicing and at equipment disposal. In order to minimize 
installation, service and disposal emissions, a trained labour 
force using special equipment is required. The baseline 
emissions and the emissions in a mitigation scenario for 2015 
are presented in Table TS-11.
What are alternative low GWP-refrigerants?
Depending on the application, alternative refrigerants to 
HFCs in residential and commercial air conditioning and 
heating equipment can include hydrocarbons, ammonia, 
water and CO2. 
Stationary air conditioners: The use of hydrocarbons in air-
cooled air conditioning products having refrigerant charge 
levels greater than 1 kg has been the focus of considerable 
risk analysis and safety standards development activities (e.g. 
European Standard EN 378). The most significant issue that 
will confront a manufacturer when considering applying 
hydrocarbon refrigerants is the determination of an acceptable 
level of risk and the associated liability. 
CO2 offers a number of desirable properties as a refrigerant: 
availability, low toxicity, low direct GWP and low cost. CO2 
systems are also likely to be smaller than those using common 
refrigerants. These benefits are offset by the fact that the 
use of CO2 in air conditioning applications requires high 
operating pressures and results in low operating efficiencies, 
thereby contributing to increased indirect CO2 emissions 
through higher energy consumption. Actual system tests of 
non-optimized air conditioning systems have demonstrated 
COPs21 up to 2.25 at air inlet temperatures of 35°C compared 
to COPs up to 4.0 for typical HCFC-22 equipment.
Water chillers: Positive displacement chillers using ammonia 
as the refrigerant are available in the capacity range from 100 
to 2000 kW with a few being larger. Recommended practice 
guidelines limit the use of large ammonia systems in public 
buildings to situations in which the ammonia is confined 
to the machine room where alarms, venting devices and 
scrubbers can enhance safety. Guidelines are available for the 
safe design and application of ammonia systems. Modern, 
compact factory-built units contain the ammonia much more 
effectively than old ammonia plants.
Hydrocarbon refrigerants have a long history of application 
in industrial chillers in petrochemical plants. Before 1997, 
they were not used in comfort air conditioning chiller 
applications due to reservations about systems safety. 
European manufacturers now offer a range of positive 
displacement hydrocarbon chillers. Unit sales of hydrocarbon 
chillers amount to about 100 to 150 annually, primarily in 
northern Europe. This is a small number compared with the 
installed base of more than 77,000 HCFC and HFC chillers 
in Europe. Typical safety measures include proper placement 
and/or gas-tight enclosure of the chiller, application of the 
low-charge system design, fail-safe ventilation systems, and gas 
detector alarm-activating systems. Efficiency is similar to that 
of equivalent HCFC-22 products. The cost of hydrocarbon 
chillers is higher than that of HCFC or HFC equivalents.
CO2 is being investigated for a wide range of potential 
applications. However, CO2 does not match cycle energy 
efficiencies of fluorocarbon refrigerants for typical water 
chilling applications and, consequently, there is no 
environmental incentive to use CO2 in chillers in place of 
HFCs. There has been no commercial application of CO2 in 
chillers to date.
21 COP stands for Coefficient of Performance, a measure of the energy efficiency of a refrigerating system.

Technical Summary
Water is an attractive alternative because it is non-toxic 
and non-flammable. However, it is a very low-pressure 
refrigerant. The low pressures and very high volumetric 
flow rates required in water vapour-compression systems 
necessitate compressor designs that are uncommon in the air 
conditioning field. The few applications that exist use water as 
a refrigerant to chill water or to produce ice slurries by direct 
evaporation from a pool of water. These systems currently 
carry a cost premium of more than 50% above conventional 
systems. The higher costs are inherent and are associated 
with the large physical size of water vapour chillers and the 
complexity of their compressor technology. 
Water-heating heat pumps: Some European manufacturers 
are using propane (HC-290) or propylene (HC-1270) as 
refrigerants in small low-charge residential and commercial 
water-heating heat pumps. The hydrocarbon circuit is 
typically located outdoors or in a ventilated indoor space and 
uses ambient air, earth or ground water sources.
In water-heating applications, propane will yield the same 
or slightly higher energy efficiency as HCFC-22. When 
designing new heat pump systems with propane or other 
flammable refrigerants, adequate safety precautions must 
be taken to ensure safe operation and maintenance. Several 
standards that regulate the use of hydrocarbons in heat pumps 
exist or are being developed in Europe, Australia and New 
Zealand. An example of a standard under development is an 
update of European Standard EN 378.
The transcritical CO2 cycle exhibits a significant temperature 
glide on the high temperature side. Such a glide can be of 
benefit in a counter-flow heat exchanger. Heat pumps using 
CO2 as the refrigerant can generate water temperatures up 
to 90oC and have been developed in Japan for home use. A 
typical heating capacity is 4.5 kW. 
Ammonia has been applied in medium-size and large-capacity 
heat pumps, mainly in Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland 
and the Netherlands. System safety requirements for ammonia 
heat pumps are similar to those for ammonia chillers.
What are alternative not-in-kind technologies?
A number of other non-traditional technologies have been 
examined for their potential to reduce the consumption and 
emission of HFCs. These include desiccant systems, Stirling 
cycle systems, thermoelectrics, thermoacoustics and magnetic 
refrigeration. With the exception of the Stirling cycle and 
desiccants, these all suffer such large efficiency penalties that 
the consequent indirect effects would overwhelm any direct 
emission reduction benefit. Despite receiving research interest, 
the Stirling cycle has remained limited to niche applications 
and has never been commercialized for air conditioning. In 
high latent load applications, desiccant systems have been 
applied to supplement the latent performance of traditional 
mechanical air conditioning.
What is the overall reduction potential?
Direct GHG emissions of residential and commercial air 
conditioning and heating equipment can be reduced by about 
200 MtCO2-eq yr–1 relative to the BAU scenario (2015). 
Specific costs range from –3 to 170 US$/tCO2-eq. Improved 
system energy efficiencies can significantly reduce indirect 
GHG emissions, leading in some cases to overall savings of 
75 US$/tCO2-eq. Opportunities to reduce direct GHG (i.e. 
refrigerant) emissions can be found in (1) a more efficient 
recovery of refrigerant at end-of-life (in the mitigation 
scenario, assumed to be up to 50% and 80% for developing 
and developed countries, respectively); (2) charge reduction 
(up to 20%); (3) better containment; (4) the use of non-
fluorocarbon refrigerants in suitable applications.
4.3 What are the most important findings 
for mobile air conditioning?
What are past and current trends in MAC?
MAC systems have been mass produced in the USA since 
the early 1960s and in Japan since the 1970s. The significant 
increase in the numbers of air-conditioned cars in Europe and 
also in developing countries began later, around 1995.
As indicated in Table TS-16, the global CFC-12 fleet has 
decreased from approximately 212 million vehicles in 1990 
to 119 million vehicles in 2003, while the HFC-134a fleet 
has increased from fewer than 1 million in 1992 up to 338 
million in 2003.
On the basis of a BAU scenario, and including high economic 
growth of rapidly-developing countries, Figure TS-11 shows 
a projected increase in the air-conditioned fleet that reaches 
approximately 965 million air-conditioned vehicles by 2015. 
What are current emissions and projections?
Emissions from vehicles continuing to use MAC systems 
with CFC-12 are about 531 g yr–1 vehicle–1 when all types 
of emissions are included (fugitive emissions represent 
220 g yr–1 vehicle–1). Recovery and recycling are performed for 
CFC-12 in end-of-life of vehicles in some countries, but the 
CFC-12 will still eventually be released into the atmosphere 
following these practices unless it is destroyed. The annual 
emissions (2002) from the global fleet of air-conditioned 
CFC-12-based vehicles are about 514 MtCO2-eq yr–1 (fugitive 
emissions represent 213 MtCO2-eq yr–1). Projections suggest

scenario.
that the effect of the MAC subsector on radiative forcing of 
the climate system will be dominated by emissions of CFC-12 
through to 2006 at the earliest.
The direct emissions from the global fleet of HFC-134a-
based MAC systems are estimated to be about 220 g yr–1 
vehicle–1 including fugitive emissions that account for 130 g 
yr–1 vehicle–1 or, when expressed as CO2-equivalents, about 96 
MtCO2-eq yr–1 including fugitive emissions that account for 
56 MtCO2-eq yr–1. Current ‘do-it-yourself’ kits for recharging 
air conditioners that use disposable cans of fluids lead to 
at least a twofold increase in emissions to the atmosphere 
compared with professional servicing that uses more efficient 
fluid-delivery components. 
Table TS-11 emphasizes the rapid change in refrigerant 
choice that has resulted from implementation of the Montreal 
Protocol.
What are the indirect energy-related CO2 emissions related to 
MAC operation?
The operation of MAC systems worldwide leads to a 
substantial indirect effect through increased fuel use and 
associated CO2 emissions. Current fuel consumption tests 
and standards in the motor vehicle industry do not explicitly 
evaluate this effect, which varies by climate zone. Depending 
on climate conditions, it is estimated that MAC systems 
represent 2.5−7.5% additional fuel consumption, or about 
126 kg (Tokyo) to 369 (Phoenix) kg of CO2 yr–1 vehicle–1. 
With the total number of air-conditioned vehicles estimated 
to be 457 million (in 2003), the indirect effect corresponds 
to as much as 114 MtCO2-eq yr–1 (when averaged across 
the global fleet and assuming an average value of 250 kg   
CO2 yr–1 vehicle–1) relative to 750 MtCO2-eq yr–1 of direct 
emissions. 
What are possible future trends in MAC?
The following options exist for reducing GHG emissions: (1) 
enhance the current HFC-134a systems; (2) move to lower 
GWP refrigerants, either HFC-152a or CO2. Hydrocarbons, 
even if they are low GWP refrigerants and efficient when 
properly used, are not seen as suitable options by car makers 
and suppliers due to safety concerns.
‘Improved’ HFC-134a systems are being introduced 
progressively onto the market, at an additional cost varying 
from 24−36 US$ per system. These employ tighter hoses, 
compressors and service valves, all of which reduce leakage. 
Recent studies suggest that improved HFC-134a systems 
and improved servicing could result in emissions of about 
70 g yr–1 vehicle–1, which is about 60% lower than those 
from current HFC-134a systems. Improvements in recovery 
practices and service training could further reduce emissions. 
Significant energy savings are related to the use of variable 
volume compressors with an external control, which are also 
being progressively introduced in the market. Additional 
savings are related to a MAC system design that integrates 
energy efficiency constraints.
Several recent studies suggest that improvements in energy 
efficiency, through measures such as on/off controls instead of 
standard continuous operation, insulation of doors and roofs 
and so forth, could reduce these emissions by about 30−40%, 
which represents 30−40 MtCO2-eq yr–1.

Technical Summary
MAC systems using CO2 have been successfully demonstrated 
in passenger vehicles and commercial buses. CO2 has a 
GWP that is 1300-fold smaller than HFC-134a, thereby 
limiting the direct effects per charge. However, CO2 systems 
operate at pressures about eightfold higher than those of 
CFC-12 and HFC-134a (discharge pressures in the order of 
12 MPa), and since leak flow rates are related to the square 
of the pressure, CO2 systems imply a much more difficult 
containment. To date, CO2 systems have shown an energy 
efficiency comparable to or better than improved HFC-134a 
systems in cooler ambient climates, but they are likely to be 
less efficient in warmer climates. Nevertheless, as indicated 
in Table TS-17, due to its nearly negligible direct effect, the 
TEWI of CO2 systems is significantly better than that of 
improved HFC-134a systems. Barriers to commercialization 
include the resolution of additional costs and safety issues 
associated with the release of CO2 within the passenger cabin 
and maintenance issues as well as the conversion cost of the 
service system. 
HFC-152a has also been successfully demonstrated in 
MAC systems. While HFC-152a systems can use the same 
components as HFC-134a systems, the former require an 
added safety system because HFC-152a is flammable while 
HFC-134a is non-flammable. Direct emissions (in CO2-
equivalents) are very low (92% reduction, referred to as the 
HFC-134a baseline). HFC-152a systems have so far shown 
an energy efficiency comparable with or better than improved 
HFC-134a systems, but the energy gain could be lost if a 
secondary loop system required by safety considerations is 
used. However, its overall climate impact, expressed in TEWI, 
is still significantly lower than that of HFC-134a and in 
the same order of magnitude of CO2 systems. The principle 
barriers to commercialization at the present time are the 
resolution of the flammability risk and the assurance of a 
commercial global availability of HFC-152a.
Table TS-17 presents a comparison of the primary MAC 
systems currently in use, under development or demonstrated. 
For each option, issues of relative cost are indicated, along 
with points that need to be considered to evaluate the effects 
on the radiative forcing of the climate system, including 
the indirect effects. It has to be emphasized that the choice 
of a given technical option in a given year will have only a 
limited effect in the first years of introduction due to all the 
refrigerant banked in − and emitted by − the current fleet.
4.4 What are the most important findings 
for foams?
What applications are foams currently used for and why? 
Foamed (or cellular) polymers have been used historically in 
a variety of applications that utilize the potential for creating 
either ﬂexible or rigid structures. Flexible foams continue 
to be used eﬀectively for furniture cushioning, packaging 
and impact management (safety) foams. Rigid foams are 
used primarily for thermal insulation applications such as 
those required for appliances, transport and in buildings. In 
addition, rigid foams are used to provide structural integrity 
and buoyancy. 
For thermal insulation applications (the majority of rigid foam 
use), mineral ﬁbre alternatives (e.g. glass ﬁbre and mineral 
wool) have been, and continue to be, major not-in-kind 
alternatives. Table TS-18 illustrates the major beneﬁts and 
limitations of both approaches. 
The implications of these relative beneﬁts and limitations vary 
substantially, both between products within a category and 
between applications. This makes a generic conclusion about 
Table TS-18. Benefits and limitations of the use of both mineral fibres and cellular polymers in thermal insulation applications.

Technical Summary
preferences impossible. The current thermal insulation market 
supports a variety of solutions (at least 15 major product 
types), and this reﬂects the range of requirements demanded 
for the applications served. Unfortunately, there are only 
limited data available on the thermal insulation market at 
global and regional levels. One of the complexities of global 
market analysis is the diﬀerence in building practices around 
the world, which often respond to material availability and 
climatic conditions. 
Purely as an example, a systematic and periodic analysis of the 
European thermal insulation market has enabled the trends 
over the period from 1990−2001 to be identiﬁed (Figure 
TS-12). This analysis indicates a growing reliance on foamed 
products in thermal insulation applications that has been 
driven in part by the increased use of metal-faced panels in 
Europe, which in turn relies increasingly on foamed cores. 
However, the harmonization of ﬁre classiﬁcations in Europe 
over the coming 5 years may cause the trend to be arrested or 
even reversed. Such is the volatility of these markets and the 
importance of maintaining ranges of product types.
In reviewing the not-in-kind options, it is important to 
acknowledge continuing development. For example, it seems 
likely that the use of vacuum insulation panels (evacuated 
and sealed foam matrices) in domestic refrigerators and 
freezers will increase. In fact, most Japanese units already 
contain at least one such panel in strategic design positions. 
Other opportunities include multilayer reﬂective foils but the 
thermal eﬃciency of these is, as yet, far from proven.
The relationship between foam products, processes for 
manufacture and applications is complex. Table TS-19 
summarizes the main interrelationships between generic 
product types and applications for both non-insulating and 
insulating foams, while the main chapter deals with the 
additional overlay of processes for manufacture.

Technical Summary
What blowing agents have been used historically and what are 
the trends for the future? 
At the point of discovery of the ozone hole in the early 
1980s, virtually all of the applications and product types 
listed above used CFCs as either a primary blowing agent 
(rigid foams) or auxiliary blowing agent (ﬂexible foams). The 
total consumption of CFCs by the foam sector in 1986 was 
approximately 250 ktonnes (165 ktonnes rigid; 85 ktonnes 
ﬂexible). Blowing-agent use overall grew by a further 30% 
over the next 15 years, despite improved blowing eﬃciencies 
and reduced losses. In the meantime, however, a variety 
of alternative blowing agents have been evaluated and 
adopted. These include HCFCs (as transitional substances), 
hydrocarbons, HFCs, methylene chloride (for ﬂexible foams) 
and various forms of CO2. Figure TS-13 summarizes the 
situation in 2001.
Figure TS-14 illustrates the projected growth of blowing-agent

Technical Summary
What are the implications of past, present and future use 
patterns?
Past, present and future use patterns have impacts on both 
emissions and the accrual of banked blowing agents. Figure 
TS-15 illustrates the projected emissions between 1990 and 
2015 based on the historical and future use of blowing agents 
in foam. The graph shows the projected annual emission of 
all blowing-agent types up to 2015. Table TS-20 assesses the 
projected development of banks by region and application 
area. It is clear that much of the emissions from the foams 
used in buildings has yet to take place.
What drives the selection of blowing agents?
Thermal conductivity
The ability to retain blowing agents within foams provides 
opportunities to improve the eﬃciency of the thermal 
insulation relative to air-ﬁlled products. However, such 
beneﬁts can only be achieved when the thermal conductivities 
of the retained blowing agents are lower than that of air. This 
is the case for all blowing agents highlighted in the Figure

Technical Summary
TS-15. However, the relative performance of the various 
blowing-agent types does vary with temperature; for example, 
the comparative advantages of HFCs over hydrocarbons are 
greater in refrigerators (average temperature of 5°C) than in 
water heaters (average temperature of 40°C). In addition, the 
size and shape of the cells also aﬀects the overall performance 
of the foams and, therefore, product comparisons are not 
always straightforward. 
Flammability (product and process)
The overall ﬂammability of a foam product is inﬂuenced by 
the choice of polymeric matrix and facing material as well 
by the choice of blowing agent. However, it is often the 
case that the contribution of the blowing agent can shift 
the classiﬁcation of a product or can change the attitude of 
insurers to the risk posed. In addition, the handling of certain 
ﬂammable blowing agents can create fundamental challenges 
in some foam processes. This is particularly the case for small 
and medium enterprises (SMEs), for which economies of 
scale do not exist and discontinuous processes dominate. In 
the case of ﬂammable blowing agents, investment criteria vary 
considerably depending on whether the investment relates to 
a new plant or modiﬁcation of an existing plant. In the latter 
case, costs can often be prohibitive if the plant is old or if it 
is owned by a small or medium enterprise. Employer liability 
issues can also be a cause for concern in some regions with a 
strong litigious heritage.
 
What has already been done to minimize use?
When the three aspects presented above are taken into 
consideration, HFCs emerge as the preferred option in 
several key sectors, although the progress made in developing 
alternative technologies has ensured that uptake has been 
constrained. An example of this is the continuing extension of 
the application of hydrocarbon technologies. However, even in 
cases where HFCs have been adopted, there are two additional 
points to consider: 
(1) How much HFC is required in the formulation to 
achieve the required performance?
(2) Which HFC should be chosen? 
The cost of HFCs can be a general constraint on uptake. 
Blowing-agent costs typically represent a signiﬁcant element 
of overall variable costs. Accordingly, any substantial elevation 
in blowing-agent costs can inﬂuence variable costs by up 
to 15%. In a highly competitive market, such increases are 
unsustainable and prevent selection, unless formulation 
changes can be made to reduce dependence on the more 
expensive blowing agent. An example of this is the co-blowing 
of HFC-based polyurethane foams with CO2 generated from 
the reaction of isocyanate and water. 
Nonetheless, the overall decision is a complex one based on 
combinations of direct blowing-agent cost, related formulation 
issues (e.g. the use of increased ﬂame retardant or foam density 
penalties), product performance, process safety and capital 
costs. As noted previously, the latter are particularly relevant to 
SMEs and other small volume consumers.
The net eﬀect of the above selection of considerations on HFC 
demand has been to reduce previous (1999) projections of 115 
ktonnes consumption in 2010 to 60 ktonnes in 2010 in this 
current report. This can already be considered as a reduction 
facilitated by the application of responsible use principles by 
the foam industry.
Lowest GWP selection
Since the two prime liquid HFCs (HFC-245fa and HFC-
365mfc) have similar 100-year GWPs, the choice between 
the two has been driven more by a consideration of respective 
boiling points and blowing eﬃciencies. For gaseous blowing 
agents, HFC-152a has a much lower 100-year GWP than 
HFC-134a. However, HFC-152a is more ﬂammable than 
HFC-134a and is also emitted much faster from some types 
of foam (e.g. extruded polystyrene). This can mean that short-
term impacts of HFC-152a use can be as signiﬁcant as those 
of HFC-134a. In addition, the thermal insulating beneﬁt 
of HFC-152a can be short-lived. All of these factors have to 
be evaluated during the selection of the appropriate blowing 
agent. 
What additional  measures can reduce future emissions further 
and what actions are required?
Further substitution 
While the adoption of responsible use criteria in HFC 
selection has successfully reduced the consumption of HFCs 
in the foam sector by nearly 50% over that predicted in 1999, 
there are several areas in which further substitution may be 
possible over the next 5−10 years. For example: 
• wider hydrocarbon use in polyurethane spray foam;
• wider CO2 use in extruded polystyrene (XPS);
• wider hydrocarbon use in appliance foams;
• changes in the attitude of insurers to hydrocarbons in 
panels.
Although the impacts of each of these trends can be modelled 
individually, the uncertainties are too great to be meaningful. 
Accordingly, in this assessment, two high-level mitigation 
scenarios are presented to evaluate the impact of pursuing such 
options.
Process of good practice 
Work has already been initiated on establishing procedures 
for the identiﬁcation and minimization of process losses. 
While this work is important in setting the right tone for the 
handling of HFCs in foam processes, the potential savings 
are unlikely to reach more than 2−3% of total life-cycle 
emissions, since most processes are already well enclosed. One

Technical Summary
exception might be in the emissions during polyurethane spray 
application, where further eﬀort is still required to quantify 
losses; future eﬀorts may lead to improvements in spray head 
design. 
Waste management
Waste minimization is a clear objective of all businesses. 
However, foam manufacturers face speciﬁc challenges: 
• product proliferation requiring more versatile production 
processes;
• intrinsic fabrication losses (e.g. cutting pipe sections from 
block foam).
The management of this waste is therefore a key issue in 
minimizing emissions. The mitigation-scenario models assess 
the eﬀects of a combination of process and waste management 
improvements.
 
Bank management (refrigerators)
The size of existing and future banks of blowing agent in 
the appliance and transport sectors has been estimated. The 
baseline scenario already takes into account the recovery 
activity occurring in Europe and Japan, so bank sizes do 
not automatically equate to future emissions. With proven 
technology and the cost of recovery from refrigerators 
currently estimated at 10−50 US$/tCO2-eq, it would appear 
reasonable to assume that all refrigerator foams could be 
managed at end-of-life by 2015, if the investment in plants to 
do so were appropriately dispersed geographically. This would, 
however, involve investment in developing as well as developed 
countries. One scenario evaluated in this report examines the 
potential impact of all appliances being processed at end-of-
life with anticipated recovery levels in excess of 80% of the 
original blowing-agent loading.
Bank management (buildings)
For the building sector, the technical feasibility and economic 
viability of blowing-agent recovery is less well established. 
Activities such as the Japan Testing Center for Construction 
Materials (JTCCM) project in Japan are assisting the 
development of further knowledge in this area. At present, 
however, the general consensus is that recovery will be 
considerably more expensive than from appliances because of 
the lower yield (caused by losses in the use and recovery phases) 
and the additional costs of demolition waste separation. 
One exception to this trend is in the metal-faced panel market 
where blowing-agent retention and ease of dismantling may 
allow recovery through existing refrigerator plants. The bank 
available from polyurethane panels has been assessed and 
is expected to exceed 700 ktonnes in ﬂuorocarbon blowing 
agents by 2015. Recovery costs are expected to be in the same 
range as for appliances, but work is continuing to conﬁrm this. 
Both scenarios have been modelled, but with a more modest 
expectation of 20% recovery from traditional building sources.
What is the significance of these potential scenarios to wider 
climate and ozone strategies? 
The baseline emissions for the BAU scenario are shown 
in Figure TS-16. Because the life cycles of foams are so 
signiﬁcant, all graphs in this section illustrate the likely 
impact of possible emission reduction scenarios up to 2100. 
The baseline assumption is a freeze at 2015 consumption 
levels for both HCFCs and HFCs. It is assumed that HCFCs 
are phased-out linearly between 2030 and 2040. Bearing in 
mind that technology developments are likely to continue in 
the foams sector, reliance on HFCs is not expected beyond 
2030, and a linear decline is assumed from 2020. As a further 
reference point, the ongoing emissions from the banks 
already established at 2015 are also shown. The three primary 
elements of the mitigation scenario can be summarized as 
follows:
• a linear decrease in the use of HFCs between 2010 and 
2015, leading to a 50% reduction by 2015;
• the adoption of production emission reduction strategies 
from 2005 onwards for all block foams and from 2008 
onwards in other foam subsectors;
• the extension of existing end-of-life measures to all 
appliances and steel-faced panels by 2010 together with a 
20% recovery rate from other building-based foams from 
2010.
The resulting impacts of these three measures are as shown in 
Figure TS-17 and Table TS-21.

Technical Summary
It can be seen that focusing on reducing HFC consumption 
provides the most signiﬁcant saving in the period up to 2015 
and, on the basis that any such reduction is extrapolated out 
to use patterns beyond 2015, this focus oﬀers the greatest 
‘HFC-speciﬁc’ beneﬁt to 2100 as well. In contrast, end-of-
life measures deliver lower savings during the period up to 
2015, but they do have the potential to deliver more overall 
savings in the period up to 2100 if all blowing-agent types are 
considered. The value is particularly signiﬁcant for CFCs, for 
which the GWPs are high and there is an incremental eﬀect of 
ozone depletion.
The potential savings in ODSs emissions from all viable 
end-of-life strategies is shown n Figure TS-18 based in ODP 
tonnes. It can be seen that year-on-year savings in the order of 
2000−3000 ODP tonnes will accrue for the period to 2100.

Technical Summary
The estimates for reductions in both GHG and ODS 
emissions identiﬁed in this analysis from end-of-life measures 
are relatively conservative, since they are measured against a 
baseline where only 10−20% of blowing loss is accounted for 
when the foam is land-ﬁlled. This partially explains why there 
are signiﬁcant emissions after 2065. Eﬀectively, the landﬁll 
sites have become banks of their own. If a more aggressive 
assumption were to be applied to foams destined for landﬁll 
(i.e. 100% emission at the point of landﬁll), Figure TS-19 
illustrates the consequence in GHG emission terms. 
While it is recognized that the truth probably lies somewhere 
between the two extremes, the potential release of such 
signiﬁcant amounts of blowing agent over a relatively 
short period (2030−2050) draws attention to the potential 
incremental value of end-of-life management as a mitigation 
option.
4.5 What are the most important findings 
for medical aerosols?
Medical aerosols are important in the treatment of asthma and 
COPD
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
are the most common chronic diseases of the air passages 
(airways or bronchi) of the lungs and are estimated to aﬀect 
over 300 million people worldwide. These illnesses account for 
high health care expenditure and cause signiﬁcant loss of time 
from work and school and, in addition, COPD is responsible 
for premature death.
Asthma is a chronic condition with two main components, 
airway inﬂammation and airway narrowing. Most asthma 
patients have symptoms every day, with more severe attacks 
intermittently. Asthma most often starts in childhood, and 
prevalence varies from approximately 1% in some countries 
such as Indonesia to over 30% in children in New Zealand 
and Australia. 
COPD is a condition typiﬁed by narrowing and inﬂammation 
of the airways in conjunction with damage to the lung 
tissue. It is caused primarily by cigarette smoking, with 
environmental air pollution as a potential cofactor, and 
ultimately leads to permanent disability and death. The 
prevalence of COPD in many developed countries is between 
4–17% in adults over 40 years old. Data are less certain in 
developing countries, but ﬁgures as high as 26% have been 
quoted. Smoking is declining in some developed countries, 
but in developing countries both smoking and COPD are 
increasing. 
Inhaled therapy is currently and likely to remain the gold 
standard for treatment. Inhalation of aerosol medication of a 
speciﬁc particle size (1−5 microns) optimizes the local clinical 
eﬀect in the airways where it is needed, with minimal side 
eﬀects. Inhalation aerosols have been the subject of signiﬁcant 
investment in research and development, in response to both 
therapeutic and environmental needs. Currently the two main 
methods of delivering respiratory drugs for most patients are 
the metered dose inhaler (MDI) and the dry powder inhaler 
(DPI). 
 
What is a MDI?
MDIs are the dominant form of treatment for asthma and 
COPD worldwide. The MDI was introduced in the mid-
1950s with CFC-11 and CFC-12 as propellants; CFC-114 
was introduced later. In order to accomplish the phase-out 
of CFCs under the Montreal Protocol, the MDI industry 
undertook an exhaustive search for an appropriate alternative 
aerosol propellant. A medical propellant must be safe for

Technical Summary
human use and meet several additional strict criteria related to 
safety and eﬃcacy: (1) liqueﬁed gas with appropriate vapour 
pressure, (2) low toxicity, (3) non-ﬂammable, (4) chemically 
stable, (5) acceptable to patients (in terms of taste and smell), 
(6) appropriate solvency characteristics and (7) appropriate 
density. It was extremely diﬃcult to identify compounds 
fulﬁlling all of these criteria and in the end only two HFCs − 
HFC-134a and HFC-227ea – emerged as viable alternatives 
to CFCs. 
The components and formulations of CFC-based MDIs had 
to be substantially modiﬁed to use the new HFC propellants. 
As drug devices, MDIs are subject to extensive regulation 
by national health authorities to ensure product safety, 
product eﬃcacy and manufacturing quality. Therefore, the 
process for developing HFC MDIs is essentially the same 
as the development of a wholly new drug product in that it 
involves full clinical trials for each reformulated MDI. The 
development (technical, pharmaceutical, clinical) costs for the 
CFC-to-HFC transition were estimated to be approximately 
US$ 1 billion in 1999 and hence now will be signiﬁcantly 
higher. Similar costs would be expected for de-novo DPI 
development programmes to replace existing molecules in 
MDIs. 
What is a DPI?
DPIs deliver powdered medication of speciﬁc particle size, 
do not use propellants and have no impact on the ozone 
layer or climate. Delivery of the active drug in powder form 
is technically diﬃcult. For example, particles of respirable 
size tend to have poor ﬂow characteristics due to adhesive 
interparticle forces. Additionally, most DPI formulations are 
sensitive to moisture during processing, storage and in use, 
thereby limiting their utility in humid climates. 
Early DPIs providing single premeasured doses had limited 
use in the 1960s and 1970s. Signiﬁcant technical progress has 
led to patient-friendly multidose DPIs becoming more widely 
available in the past decade, and this has mitigated the increase 
in MDI use. DPIs have been formulated successfully for many 
inhaled drugs and are now widely available in many but not all 
countries. However, they are not an alternative to pressurized 
MDIs for all patients or for all drugs. 
The relative cost of DPIs is high, especially compared 
with MDIs containing salbutamol, which still account for 
approximately 50% of the MDIs prescribed worldwide. In a 
study conducted to compare the costs across seven European 
countries, the salbutamol DPIs were found to cost on average 
2.6 times more than MDIs. 
What factors influence treatment choice?
Primary prevention of asthma is not yet feasible, while primary 
prevention of COPD entails not commencing tobacco 
smoking. The prevalence of asthma and COPD is likely to 
continue to increase.
The choice of the most suitable drugs and inhaler are decided 
by physician and patient based on many factors including 
disease and severity, compliance, ease of use, cost, availability 
and patient preference. Inhaler devices are only eﬀective if 
used correctly. Patients will often be able to use one device 
correctly but not another. Both MDIs and DPIs have an 
important role in treatment, and no single delivery system is 
universally acceptable for all patients. It is critical to preserve 
the range of therapeutic options. 
MDIs are the dominant form of treatment for asthma and 
COPD worldwide. In developed countries, the proportion 
of current MDI to DPI use varies substantially between 
countries: in the USA, 9:1 (MDI:DPI); in the UK, 7:3; in 
Sweden, 2:8. This relates to a number of factors, including 
availability (e.g. multidose DPIs are only recently available in 
the USA compared with a local company with a long tradition 
of DPI manufacture in Sweden) and aﬀordability.
What are the future technical developments?
Annual growth in the global market in inhaled asthma/COPD 
medication up to 2015 is projected at approximately 1.5−3% 
yr–1. A large portion of CFCs are being replaced by HFCs 
(approximately 90% HFC-134a and 10% HFC-227ea), 
and all MDI use in the developed world will be HFC by 
2010. From a peak annual CFC use of over 15,000 tonnes 
in 1987−2000, CFC use in MDIs has fallen to an estimated 
8000 tonnes, with HFC accounting for 3000−4000 tonnes, 
in the period 2001−2004, and by 2015, HFC use is estimated 
to rise to 13,000−15,000 tonnes. The lower use of HFCs 
compared to peak CFC use is partly due to increased use of 
DPIs and partly because some HFC MDIs use less propellant 
per actuation. 
No major technical breakthroughs in device technology are 
expected in the short-term. Research and development for a 
new inhalation product is a lengthy, technically challenging 
and expensive process and typically takes over 10 years to 
reach the market. Future inhalation devices such as nebulizers 
and DPIs with a power source to make them independent 
of a patient’s breath or small aqueous multidose devices will 
probably be more expensive than present-day DPIs and will 
therefore be even more expensive than HFC MDIs 
In developing countries, inhaled therapy is almost exclusively 
with pressurized MDIs, either from multinational or local

Technical Summary
manufacturers. Improved economic circumstances together 
with the adoption of international treatment guidelines 
will likely substantially increase inhaled therapy. Aﬀordable 
and less complex DPIs are technically feasible and could be 
manufactured locally in developing countries. There would 
be signiﬁcant pharmaceutical diﬃculties in hot and humid 
climates, and they would remain more expensive than MDIs 
on a cost-per-dose basis. If these became available and 
achieved a signiﬁcant market share, they could mitigate the 
future increases in volumes of HFC needed for MDIs. 
What would be the cost of a complete switch from HFC MDIs to 
DPIs?
Typically, newer multidose DPIs contain more expensive 
drugs, whereas about 50% of MDIs contain salbutamol, 
which is less expensive and oﬀ patent. This explains part of 
the diﬀerence in individual inhaler cost. It has been estimated 
that by 2015 there could be as many as 340 million HFC 
MDI units containing salbutamol. Switching these to an 
equivalent salbutamol DPI would incur signiﬁcant costs to 
health care systems. Hypothetical estimates of the cost of 
switching completely from HFC MDIs to DPIs (assuming a 
minimal twofold increase in price) would be on the order of 
an additional and recurrent US$ 1.7−3.4 billion yr–1 (150−300 
US$/tCO2-eq). The emission reduction achieved would be 
about 10 MtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2015. This additional cost would 
signiﬁcantly impact on patient care.
Would there be any medical constraints for a switch from HFC 
MDIs to DPIs?
Switching patients from reliable and eﬀective medications 
has signiﬁcant implications for patient health and safety, and 
the provision of a range of safe alternatives is critical before 
enforcing change on environmental grounds. Any future 
environmental policy measures that could impact on patient 
use of HFC MDIs would require careful consideration 
and consultation with physicians, patients, national health 
authorities and other health care experts.
What the are key conclusions?
• The major impact in reducing GWP with respect to MDIs is 
the completion of the transition from CFC to HFC MDIs.
• No major breakthroughs for inhaled drug delivery are 
anticipated in the next 10−15 years given the current status 
of technologies and the development time scales involved. 
• The health and safety of the patient is of paramount 
importance in treatment decisions and in policy making that 
might impact those decisions.
• Based on the hypothetical case of switching the most widely 
used inhaled medicine (salbutamol) from HFC MDIs to 
DPI, the projected recurring annual costs would be in the 
order of US$ 1.7 billion with an eﬀective mitigation cost of 
150−300 US$/tCO2-eq for a reduction of about 10 MtCO2-
eq yr–1 by 2015.
4.6 What are the most important findings 
for fire protection?
What are past and current trends in fire protection?
Halons are gases that display exceptional safety, eﬃciency 
and cleanliness in ﬁre-ﬁghting applications. These gases 
were widely used worldwide in both ﬁxed and portable 
ﬁre-extinguishing equipment beginning in the early 1960s. 
Because of their high ODPs, governments and ﬁre protection 
professionals led the ﬁrst sector-wide phase-out under the 
Montreal Protocol. This led to the development of a range of 
eﬀective alternatives for new systems. Since ﬁre protection is a 
highly regulated sector, adopting alternatives requires extensive 
changes in local, national and international standards, 
practices and technology. These changes have reduced 
unnecessary emissions from the halon bank and are also being 
applied to the halon alternatives.
There are two categories of applications that can require halon 
or an alternative: fixed systems and portable extinguishers. 
Halon 1301 dominated the market in fixed systems prior to 
the Montreal Protocol, and its remaining bank was about 
45 ktonnes in 2000. Halon 1211 was primarily used in 
portable extinguishers, and the bank in 2000 was estimated 
at about 154 ktonnes. Halon 2402 was used predominantly 
in the former Soviet Union, and no information on banks or 
emissions is available in the literature. One estimate of 2000 
emissions is 2.3 ktonnes for halon 1301 and 17.8 ktonnes 
for halon 1211, or about 5% and 11% of the bank per year, 
respectively. One study suggests that the emission rate for 
halon 1301 in fixed systems, excluding ships, aircraft and 
military systems, is as little as 0.12% yr–1 when an exceptional 
level of diligence is made in tracking and keeping the halon 
in place for providing critical fire protection. An extremely 
low (0.12% yr–1) rate of emissions has been achieved in one 
region, primarily due to unique cultural factors together with 
unusually strong enforcement action, both of which may be 
difficult to replicate in other regions. On average, emission 
rates for fixed systems are about 2 ± 1% yr–1 and about twice 
that for portable extinguishers, that is, 4 ± 2% yr–1 of the 
bank (installed base including stocks for recharge).
Fire protection is strictly regulated in most countries. New 
agents/techniques can only be used following a demonstration 
of acceptable safety and ﬁre-extinguishment performance 
according to speciﬁc protocols. It is important that countries 
without national standards strive to adopt the practices

Technical Summary
recommended in international standards in order to protect 
against the introduction of unsafe or ineﬀective alternatives. 
Selecting an alternative to halon involves evaluating a wide 
range of factors. These include space and weight, cost, safety, 
requirements for ‘cleanliness’ (i.e. without residue or damage 
such as in the storage of records or cultural heritage buildings), 
environmental performance, eﬀectiveness against a speciﬁc 
ﬁre threat (ﬁres in solid materials (‘Class A’ ﬁres), ﬂammable 
liquids (‘Class B’ ﬁres) and energized electrical equipment 
(‘Class C’ ﬁres) and special circumstances (e.g. very cold 
conditions).
Halon is no longer necessary in most (>95%) new installations 
that would have used halons in pre-Montreal Protocol 
times. The remaining new installations still using halons 
are principally in commercial aircraft and some military 
applications for which an eﬀective alternative to halons has yet 
to be found. Among the applications formerly protected by 
halons, about half of today’s new installations are based upon 
non-gaseous alternatives, such as water and dry powders, while 
the other half make use of in-kind gaseous agents, including a 
range of halocarbons and inert gases. 
In ﬁxed systems where a clean agent is necessary, the 
alternatives currently available are CO2, inert gases (such 
as nitrogen and argon), HFCs, PFCs, HCFCs and, more 
recently, a ﬂuoroketone (FK). Some of these alternatives 
have no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the climate system, while others 
have substantial GWPs. Only the HCFCs are also ozone-
depleting. PFCs and HCFCs were used in the early stages 
of implementation of the Montreal Protocol but do not 
provide any advantage over other halocarbon clean agents. 
New PFC systems are no longer being produced due to the 
environmental impacts of these gases upon the climate relative 
to other alternatives with similar capabilities and costs. CO2 
systems may be appropriate for some applications but are 
lethal at concentrations necessary to extinguish ﬁres, while 
inert gas systems may also be appropriate for use in some 
applications but have signiﬁcant weight and volume impacts 
and are not recommended when speed of ﬁre suppression is 
an issue, due to a discharge rate that is ﬁve to six times slower 
than that of halocarbon systems.
Table TS-22 presents a comparison of the primary systems 
currently in use, under development or demonstratied 
for clean, ﬁxed systems of ﬁre extinguishment suitable for 
occupied spaces (typically replacing halon 1301). For each 
option, issues of relative cost are indicated, along with 
considerations needed to evaluate the eﬀects on the radiative 
forcing of the climate system and practical concerns such as 
system weight and space requirements, special capabilities and 
availability.
Figure TS-20 is an illustration of the production, emission 
levels and resultant bank sizes of halon 1301 and its HFC/
PFC/HCFC/FK alternatives for the period 1965−2015. 
The bank of Halon 1301 in 2002 is projected to be 42,434 
tonnes with 2052 tonnes of emissions, which agrees well with 
atmospheric measurements indicating 1000−2000 tonnes 
of emissions. The combined bank of all HFC/PFC/HCFC/
FK alternatives in ﬁxed systems in 2004 is estimated to be 
approximately 26,700 tonnes. PFCs make up about 2.5% of 
that total. By one estimate, the HCFC portion can be as high 
as approximately 3600 tonnes (about 13%). Studies suggest 
that emission rates of 2 ± 1% year–1 are now practical in these 
systems. At a 2% emission rate, the 2004 emissions represent 
1.4 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent (MtCO2-eq).
For portable extinguishers, ﬁre codes and costs are the primary 
drivers in choosing an alternative (typically replacing Halon 
1211). Portable extinguishers employing HFCs and PFCs 
have found limited market acceptance due primarily to their 
high costs compared to more traditional extinguishing agents 
such as CO2, dry chemicals and water. HCFC acceptance 
has been greater but is also limited by its high cost relative 
to those of more traditional agents. Dry chemical agents are 
between about six and sixteen times cheaper than the clean 
agents and are most eﬀective in terms of ﬁre ratings, but they 
have the disadvantage of agent residue. HFCs, PFCs and 
HCFCs are the most expensive and least eﬀective in terms of 
ﬁre-extinguishing performance (i.e. their ﬁre ratings). Table 
TS-23 presents a comparison of the alternative portable 
ﬁre extinguishers. For each option, relative cost and climate 
considerations are indicated as well as practical concerns such 
as weights and dimensions. Users of Halon 1211 portable 
extinguishers in the past currently have three choices: a 
single HFC/HCFC extinguisher at increased cost, a single 
dry chemical extinguisher if the residue can be tolerated or 
two extinguishers − one of water for ordinary combustibles, 
and a second of CO2 for use in ﬂammable liquid ﬁres or 
near electrically energized equipment. Local and national 
regulations often dictate the choice of portable extinguishers. 
Figure TS-21 is an illustration of the production, emission 
levels and resultant bank sizes of Halon 1211 and its HFC/
PFC/HCFC alternatives for the period 1965−2015. The 
Halon 1211 bank in 2002 is projected to be 124,843 tonnes 
with 17,319 tonnes of emissions. This is approximately twice 
the 7000–8000 tonnes of emissions one would expect based 
on atmospheric measurements. While no data are available in 
the literature, information provided by a producer combined 
with modelling, estimates the portable extinguisher bank of 
HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs at approximately 1471 tonnes at the 
end of 2002 with 0.12 MtCO2-eq of emissions. The estimate 
for 2004 is approximately 1852 tonnes with emissions of 0.16 
MtCO2-eq at a 4% emission rate. Approximately 68% are 
HCFCs, 30% are HFCs and 2% are PFCs.

1 and non-Annex 1 countries.
Explanation of special capabilities:
1. In some jurisdictions HFC-125 is not allowed for use in occupied spaces while in other jurisdictions that use is permitted under certain conditions.
2. Due to the short atmospheric lifetime, no GWP can be given. It is expected to be negligible for all practical purposes (Taniguchi et al., 2003). See Section 
2.5.3.3 ‘Very short-lived hydrocarbons’ for additional information.
3. HFC-23 is effective at low temperatures (cold climates) and in large volumes due to its high vapour pressure.
4. HFC-227ea is effective in shipboard and vehicle applications due to extensive large-scale testing that has established the use parameters and demonstrated its 
specialized capabilities in these applications.
5. HFC-125 is effective in vehicle and aircraft engine applications as a result of extensive large-scale testing that has established the use parameters and demon-
strated its specialized capabilities in these applications.
6. FK-5-1-12 is in the early stages of its product life cycle and has yet to be tested for special applications beyond those achieved through the conventional  
approval testing of the requirements in ISO and NFPA type standards.
7. While the agent FK-5-1-12 is a proprietary product of a single agent-manufacturer, the agent is available from multiple systems manufacturers.

Technical Summary
What are possible future trends in fire protection?
In 2010 and 2015, emissions of the halocarbon alternatives 
in ﬁxed ﬁre-extinguishing systems are estimated by modelling 
to be as high as 2.74 and 3.72 MtCO2-eq, respectively. 
In portable extinguishers, these emissions are estimated 
by modelling to be a high as 0.25 and 0.34 MtCO2-eq, 
respectively. These estimates are based on an emission rate 
of 2% of the ﬁxed system bank and 4% of the portable 
extinguisher bank per year and assume a 3% growth rate 
per year. Eﬀorts to reduce further unnecessary emissions in 
ﬁre-extinguishing systems could reduce these values by about 
50%, while less comprehensive care in emission reductions 
would likely increase them by 50%. This puts the total 
emissions from ﬁxed ﬁre-extinguishing systems in the range 
of 2 ± 1% yr–1 and from portable extinguishers in the range of    
4 ± 2% yr–1.
While several alternatives to HFCs have been proposed for 
ﬁre protection, including inert gases, ﬂuoroketones (FKs) 
and water mist, HFCs and inert gases have become, and 
appear likely to remain, the most commonly used clean 
agents and have achieved equilibrium in the market. Due 
to the lengthy process of testing and approving new ﬁre 
protection equipment types, no additional options are likely 
to have an appreciable impact by 2015. FK 5-1-12 has been 
commercialized and is now available, but there is no basis 
for predicting its rate of market acceptance or its eﬀect on 
the already established equilibrium. There is currently no 
basis for estimating any reduction in the use or emissions of 
HFC/PFC/HCFCs in ﬁre protection by 2015. In addition, 
a relationship exists between the halon bank and the use 
of HFCs. Reductions in the use of halons will result in 
an increased use of HFCs (and other alternatives) to meet 
ﬁre protection requirements. Care must continue in the

Technical Summary
management of the halon bank to ensure an appropriate 
availability of halons. Therefore, clean agent demand will 
be inﬂuenced by economic growth and by decisions that 
regulators and halon owners make with respect to the 
disposition of agents from decommissioned systems. 
In 2010 and 2015, banks of 31 and 24 ktonnes of Halon 
1301, respectively and 33 and 19 ktonnes of Halon 1211, 
respectively, are projected to remain, but the emissions and 
the bank sizes will depend upon the eﬀectiveness of practices 
to control leakage and to handle recovery at end-of-life. Banks 
of HFC/PFC/HCFC/FK in ﬁxed systems at a 2% emission 
rate are projected to be 44 ktonnes in 2010 and 63 ktonnes 
in 2015, of which approximately 3.6 ktonnes consists of 
HCFCs. The portable extinguisher bank at a 4% emission 
rate is projected to be 3.0 ktonnes in 2010 and 3.9 ktonnes 
in 2015, assuming a 3% growth rate, of which it is estimated 
that approximately 68% are HCFCs, 30% are HFCs and 
2% are PFCs. Looking to the future, GHG emissions from 
halocarbon-based clean agent systems may either increase 
or decrease depending on future market acceptance of the 
alternatives to halons. As research into new ﬁre protection 
technologies continues, additional replacement options will 
likely emerge post-2015.
4.7 What are the most important findings 
for non-medical aerosols and solvents 
and for HFC-23 emissions?
What are past and current trends?
Prior to the Montreal Protocol, ODSs were widely used 
as a cleaning solvent for metals, electronics and precision 
applications, and in consumer and technical and safety 
aerosols as propellants or solvents. ODS use in these 
applications has been eliminated or reduced dramatically. 
Most solvent cleaning applications now rely on not-in-
kind substitutes. A small percentage have or are expected to 
transition to HFCs or hydrofluoroethers (HFEs). PFC use is 
declining and expected to be eliminated by 2025.
Non-medical aerosols
Aerosol products use gas pressure to propel liquid, paste 
or powder active ingredients in precise spray patterns with 
controlled droplet size and quantity. They can also be made 
into products that use the gas only. In developed countries, 
98% of non-medical aerosols now use non-ozone-depleting, 
very low GWP propellants (hydrocarbons, dimethylether, 
CO2 or nitrogen). These substitutions led to a total reduction 
of GHG emissions from non-medical aerosol origin by 
over 99% between 1977 and 2001. The remaining aerosol 
products using either HCFCs (in developing countries 
where HCFC consumption is allowed until 2040) or HFCs 
(HFC-152a and HFC–134a) do so because these propellants 
provide a safety, functional or health benefit for the users. 
Additionally, the use of HFCs in non-medical aerosols is 
further limited by cost. HFCs are between five and eight 
times more expensive than hydrocarbons. In 2003, HFC use 
in aerosols represented total emissions of about 22 MtCO2-eq. 
Solvents
It is estimated that by 1999, 90% of the ODS solvent use had 
been reduced through conservation and substitution with not-
in-kind technologies (no-clean flux, aqueous or semi-aqueous 
cleaning and hydrocarbon solvents). The remaining 10% of 
solvent use is shared by several organic solvent alternatives. 
The in-kind substitutes for CFC-113 and CFC-11 include 
HCFCs, PFCs, HFCs and HFEs. The only HCFC solvents 
currently used are HCFC-141b and HCFC-225ca/cb. Most 
HCFC-141b use is for foam blowing; solvent applications 
represented less than 10% of its global use in 2002. The use 
of HCFC-141b is banned in the EU and is rapidly declining 
in other developed countries. In developing countries, the use 
of HCFC-141b is still increasing, especially in China, India 
and Brazil, as economic growth rates are high. HCFC-225ca/
cb use is directed to niche applications, and because of its 
ODP and phase-out schedule, it is being gradually replaced 
by HFC, HFE and not-in-kind alternatives. 
Production byproducts and fugitives
Emissions of ODSs, HFCs and PFCs also occur during the 
production of fluorocarbons, either as undesired byproducts 
or as losses of useful material as fugitive emissions. Fugitive 
losses are small and generally represent less than 1% of total 
production. The most significant of the byproducts is HFC-
23 (fluoroform), which is generated during the manufacture 
of HCFC-22. While the Montreal Protocol will eventually 
phase out the direct use of HCFC-22, its use as a feedstock 
is permitted to continue indefinitely because it does not 
involve the release of HCFC-22 to the atmosphere. Global 
feedstock demand has been increasing and is expected to 
continue to grow beyond 2015. HCFC-22 production is 
growing rapidly in developing countries, especially China and 
India. Commercial (non-feedstock) uses will end by 2020 in 
developed countries and by 2040 in developing countries.
HFC-23 generation ranges from 1.4−4% of total HCFC-
22 production, depending on production management and 
process circumstances. HFC-23 is the most potent (GWP 
of 14,310) and persistent (atmospheric life 270 years) of 
the HFCs. Global emissions of HFC-23 increased by an 
estimated 12% between 1990 and 1995 as a result of a similar 
increase in the global production of HCFC-22. However, due 
to the widespread implementation of process optimization 
and thermal destruction in developed countries, this trend has 
not continued and since 1995 has become smaller than the 
increase in production.

Technical Summary
What emission reduction options are available?
Non-medical aerosols
Although there are no technical barriers for the transition out 
of CFCs to alternatives for non-medical aerosol products, 
in 2001, there was still an estimated 4300 tonnes of CFCs 
used in developing countries and countries with economies 
in transition (CEIT). Technical aerosols are pressurized gas 
products used to clean, maintain, fix, test, manufacture or 
disinfect various types of equipment or used in a number of 
processes. The largest use of HFCs in technical aerosols occurs 
in dusters where the substitution of HFC-134a by HFC-152a 
is a leading factor in reducing GHG emissions. For cleaners 
(contact cleaners, flux removers) and mould release agents, 
the substitution of HCFC-141b by HFEs and HFCs with 
lower GWP offers the opportunity for additional emission 
reduction with no substantial technical issues. Safety aerosols 
(safety signal horns, tire inflators) and insecticides for planes 
and restricted areas continue to rely on HFC-134a due to 
its non-flammability. Cosmetic, convenience and novelty 
aerosol products include artificial snow, silly string and noise-
makers (horns). The majority of noise-makers (>80%) use 
hydrocarbons; artificial snow and string novelties originally 
transitioned to hydrocarbons but, after highly publicized 
safety incidents, were reformulated to HFC-134a. HFC use in 
cosmetic, convenience and novelty aerosols is being banned in 
the EU.
Table TS-24 presents a comparison of non-medical aerosol 
alternatives.
Solvents
Although HFCs are available in all regions, their use as 
solvents has been primarily in developed countries due to 
high costs and the concentration for applications in high-tech 
industries. With increasing concern about climate protection, 
HFC uses tend to be focused in critical applications with 
no other substitutes. Current use in developed countries is 
considered to have peaked and may even decline in the future. 
 
PFC solvents are no longer considered technically necessary 
for most applications, and their use is constrained to a few

Technical Summary
niche applications due to very limited performance and high 
cost. Volumes are known to have decreased since the mid-
1990s as a result of replacement with lower GWP solvents. 
Emission reduction options in solvent applications fall into 
two categories:
(1) Improved containment in existing uses. New and 
retrofitted equipment can significantly reduce emissions 
of all solvents. Optimized equipment can reduce solvent 
consumption by as much as 80% in some applications. 
Due to their high cost and ease of recycling, the 
fluorinated solvents are generally recovered and reused by 
the end-users or their suppliers. 
(2) Alternative fluids and technologies. A variety of organic 
solvents can replace HFCs, PFCs and ODSs in many 
applications. These alternative fluids include lower GWP 
compounds such as traditional chlorinated solvents, 
HFEs and n-propyl bromide. The numerous not-in-kind 
technologies, including hydrocarbon and oxygenated 
solvents, are also viable alternatives in some applications. 
Caution is warranted prior to adoption of any alternatives 
whose toxicity profile is not complete. In a limited 
number of applications, no substitutes are available due 
to the unique performance characteristics of the HFC or 
PFC in that case. 
Tables TS-25 and TS-26 present comparisons of solvent 
alternatives.
Production byproducts and fugitives 
It is technically feasible to reduce future emissions of HFC-23 
from HCFC-22 by over 90% (or by a factor of ten) through 
capture and destruction of the HFC-23 byproduct. However, 
emissions of HFC-23 could grow by as much as 60% between 
now and 2015, from about 15 ktonnes yr–1 to 23 ktonnes 
yr–1 due to anticipated growth in HCFC-22 production. The 
upper bound of HFC-23 emissions is in the order of 3−4% 
of HCFC-22 production, but the actual quantity of HFC-23 
produced depends in part on how the process is operated at 
each facility.
Techniques and procedures to reduce the generation of  
HFC-23 through process optimization can reduce average 
emissions to 2% or less of production. However, actual 
achievements vary for each facility, and it is not possible to 
eliminate HFC-23 emission by this means. Capture and 
destruction of HFC-23 by thermal oxidation is a highly 
effective option to reduce emissions. Destruction efficiency 
can be more than 99.0%, but the impact of ‘down time’ 
of thermal oxidation units on emissions needs to be taken 
into account. Assuming a technological lifetime of 15 years, 
specific abatement costs of less than 0.2 US$/tCO2-eq can be 
calculated.

Technical Summary
The calculation of HFC-23 emissions requires data not only 
on the quantities of HCFC-22 produced (the activity) and 
the rate of emission (which is influenced by process design 
and operating culture) but also on the extent to which 
emissions are abated. This has a particular influence on the 
uncertainty of HFC-23 estimates of future emissions.
Table TS-27 presents a comparison of the process 
optimization and thermal oxidation as reduction options for 
HFC-23 byproduct emissions.
What are possible future trends?
Non-medical aerosols
HFC emissions in non-medical aerosols are estimated 
at 23 MtCO2-eq in 2010. Low growth is projected for 
this sector through to 2015. While there are no technical 
barriers to formulate consumer products without HFCs, 
the use of HFC-152a in some products such as hairspray 
and deodorants will increase in the USA due to the 
implementation of regulations to control ground level ozone 
formation from hydrocarbon emission. Current volatile 
organic compound (VOC) controls in Europe do not exempt 
HFCs because of the broad definition of VOC (boiling point 
<250ºC under standard pressure/temperature conditions). 
No other VOC regulations identified elsewhere in the world 
restrict the use of hydrocarbons in non-medical aerosols. 
Solvents
Most solvent uses are emissive in nature with a short 
inventory period of a few months to 2 years. Although used 
solvents can and are distilled and recycled on site, essentially 
all quantities sold are eventually emitted. The distinction 
between consumption and emission (i.e. banking) is not 
significant for these applications. Projected global emissions of 
HFCs and PFCs from solvent uses are 4.2 MtCO2-eq in 2010 
and 4.4 MtCO2-eq in 2015. Emissions of PFCs are assumed 
to decline linearly until they are no longer used in solvent 
applications by 2025.

Technical Summary
Byproduct emissions of HFC-23
The quantity of HFC-23 produced (and that, potentially, may 
be emitted) is directly related to the production of HCFC-22 
and, as a result, emission forecasts require a scenario for future 
HCFC-22 production volumes. These will depend on the 
consumption of HCFC-22 in developed countries, which is 
declining, and the consumption in developing countries and 
global demand for fluoropolymers feedstock, both of which 
are increasing. 
Based on a BAU scenario that exactly follows the 
requirements of the Montreal Protocol, consumption and 
production of non-feedstock HCFC-22 will fall by a factor 
of ten by 2015 from the average level in 2000−2003 in 
developed countries. In the same countries, growth in the 
demand for fluoropolymer feedstock is projected to continue 
increasing linearly, leading to the feedstock demand for 
HCFC-22 doubling there by 2015. In developing countries, 
the production of HCFC-22 for both feedstock and non-
feedstock uses has grown rapidly in recent years; over the 
period 1997−2001, production for commercial (or non-
feedstock) uses grew linearly at 20 ktonnes yr-1 and feedstock 
use grew at 4.1 ktonnes yr-1. Projected at these rates until 
2015, the total global requirement for HCFC-22 would 
become about 730 ktonnes yr-1 − about 40% of which would 
be for feedstock − compared with a total of 470 ktonnes yr-1 
in the year 2000. (Table TS-28).
In the BAU case to 2015, it has been assumed that emissions 
from existing capacity (in both developed and developing 
countries) will continue at 2% of HCFC-22 production and 
that new capacity (mainly in developing countries) will emit 
HFC-23 at a rate of 4%. Consequently, emissions of HFC-23 
could grow by 60% between now and 2015 − from about 15 
ktonnes yr-1 in 2003 to 23 ktonnes yr-1 (Table TS-28).
In a variation of this scenario, the current best-practice 
technology comprising capture and thermal oxidation of 
the ‘vent gases’ is progressively introduced into all facilities, 
commencing in 2005. Destruction technology is assumed to 
be 100% efficient and to operate for 90% of the on-line time 
of the HCFC-22 plant. Reduced emissions were calculated 
from the same activity (in the form of assumed future HCFC-

22 production) as the BAU case. The difference between the 
two HFC-23 forecasts is therefore solely due to the extent 
to which destruction technology is deployed. The forecasts 
represent potential extreme cases, and future changes in 
activity will tend to increase the probability of one or the 
other. 
Destruction of byproduct emissions of HFC-23 from 
HCFC-22 production has a reduction potential of up to 300 
MtCO2-eq per year by 2015 and specific costs below 0.2 
US$/tCO2-eq according to two European studies in 2000. 
Reduction of HCFC-22 production due to market forces 
or national policies, or improvements in facility design and 
construction also could reduce HFC-23 emissions. [10.4]

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Stratospheric ozone has been depleted over the last 25 years fol-
lowing anthropogenic emissions of a number of chlorine- and 
bromine-containing compounds (ozone-depleting substances, 
ODSs), which are now regulated under the Montreal Protocol. 
The Protocol has been effective in controlling the net growth of 
these compounds in the atmosphere. As chlorine and bromine 
slowly decrease in the future, ozone levels are expected to in-
crease in the coming decades, although the evolution will also 
depend on the changing climate system.
• Emissions of chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochloro-
ﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs) have depleted stratospheric ozone. 
Globally, ozone has decreased by roughly 3% since 1980. 
The largest decreases since 1980 have been observed over 
the Antarctic in spring (the ‘ozone hole’), where the month-
ly column-ozone amounts in September and October have 
been about 40–50% below pre-ozone-hole values. Arctic 
ozone shows high year-to-year variability during winter-
spring due to variability in dynamical transport and chemi-
cal loss (which act in concert). Chemical losses of up to 
30% are observed during cold winters, whereas they are 
small for dynamically active warm years.
• Due to the control of ODSs under the Montreal Protocol and 
its Amendments and Adjustments, the abundance of anthro-
pogenic chlorine in the troposphere has peaked and is now 
declining. The tropospheric abundance of anthropogenic 
bromine began decreasing in the late 1990s. Stratospheric 
concentrations of ODSs lag those in the troposphere by  
several years. Stratospheric chlorine levels have approxi-
mately stabilized and may have already started to decline.
• Changing ODS concentrations will be a dominant fac-
tor controlling changes in stratospheric ozone for the next 
few decades. Stratospheric ozone depletion is likely to be 
near its maximum, but ozone abundance is subject to con-
siderable interannual variability. Assuming full compliance 
with measures adopted under the Montreal Protocol, ozone 
should slowly recover. Currently, there is no unequivocal 
evidence from measurements in the atmosphere that the on-
set of ozone recovery has begun.
• Models suggest that in Antarctica the peak in springtime 
ozone depletion may already have occurred or should oc-
cur within the next few years. Because of greater variability, 
predicting the timing of the peak in springtime Arctic ozone 
depletion is more uncertain but models suggest it should oc-
cur within the ﬁrst two decades of the 21st century. Based 
on these model calculations, we do not expect an Arctic 
‘ozone hole’ similar to that observed over the Antarctic.
• The ozone layer will not necessarily return to its pre-deplet-
ed state, even when the abundance of stratospheric chlorine 
and bromine returns to previous levels. ‘Recovery’ of the 
ozone layer is a complex issue: it depends not just on the 
extent to which the ODSs are replaced by non-ODSs, but 
also on emissions of gases (including ODS substitutes) that 
affect the climate system directly. 
There are many complex two-way interactions between strato-
spheric ozone and climate. Changes in stratospheric tempera-
ture and transport affect the concentration and distribution of 
stratospheric ozone; changes in tropospheric climate affect 
stratospheric circulation; changes in stratospheric ozone inﬂu-
ence the radiative forcing of the atmosphere, and hence surface 
climate, as well as the chemistry of the troposphere. While our 
understanding is still far from complete, new evidence about 
some of these interactions has emerged in recent years.
• Stratospheric ozone depletion has led to a cooling of the 
stratosphere. A signiﬁcant annual-mean cooling of the 
lower stratosphere over the past two decades (of approxi-
mately 0.6 K per decade) has been found over the mid-lati-
tudes of both hemispheres. Modelling studies indicate that 
changes in stratospheric ozone, well-mixed greenhouse 
gases and stratospheric water vapour could all have contri-
buted to these observed temperature changes. In the upper 
stratosphere the annual mean temperature trends are larger, 
with an approximately uniform cooling over 1979–1998 
of roughly 2 K per decade at an altitude of around 50 km. 
Model studies indicate that stratospheric ozone changes and 
carbon dioxide changes are each responsible for about 50% 
of the upper stratospheric temperature trend.
• The southern polar vortex, which creates the dynamical set-
ting for the Antarctic ozone hole, tends to persist longer now 
than in the decades before the appearance of the ozone hole. 
During the period 1990–2000, the vortex break-up in the 
late spring to early summer has been delayed by two to three 
weeks relative to the 1970–1980 period. 
• Future temperature changes in the stratosphere could ei-
ther enhance or reduce stratospheric ozone depletion, de-
pending on the region. Increases in the concentrations of 
well-mixed greenhouse gases, which are expected to cool 
the stratosphere, could reduce the rate of gas-phase ozone 
destruction in much of the stratosphere and hence reduce 
stratospheric ozone depletion. However ozone depletion in 
the polar lower stratosphere depends on the low tempera-
tures there. Until stratospheric ODS abundances return to 
pre-ozone-hole levels, temperature reductions in polar lat-
itudes could enhance polar ozone depletion; this effect is 
expected to be most important in the Arctic late winter to

large effect on ozone.

(transport and temperature). The dynamical feedbacks 
from greenhouse-gas increases could either enhance or re-
duce ozone abundance in these regions; currently, not even 
the sign of the feedback is known. Furthermore, dynamical 
variability can affect ozone in these regions on decadal time 
scales.
• Statistical and modelling studies suggest that changes in 
stratospheric circulation regimes (e.g., between strong and 
weak polar vortices) can have an impact on surface climate 
patterns. Because future changes in ozone will have an im-
pact on the circulation of the stratosphere, these changes 
could also inﬂuence the troposphere. In particular there are 
indications that the Antarctic ozone hole has led to a change 
in surface temperature and circulation – including the cool-
ing that has been observed over the Antarctic continent, ex-
cept over the Antarctic Peninsula where a signiﬁcant warm-
ing has been observed.
Halocarbons are particularly strong greenhouse gases (gases 
that absorb and emit thermal infrared radiation); a halocarbon 
molecule can be many thousands of times more efﬁcient at ab-
sorbing radiant energy emitted from the Earth than a molecule 
of carbon dioxide. Ozone is a greenhouse gas that also strongly 
absorbs ultraviolet and visible radiation. Changes in these gases 
have affected the Earth’s radiative balance in the past and will 
continue to affect it in the future.
• Over the period 1750–2000 halocarbon gases have contri- 
buted a positive direct radiative forcing of about 0.33 W m–2, 
which represents about 13% of the total well-mixed green-
house gas radiative forcing over this period. Over the peri-
od 1970–2000 halocarbon gases represent about 23% of the 
total well-mixed greenhouse gas radiative forcing. Over the 
same period, only about 5% of the total halocarbon radia-
tive forcing is from the ODS substitutes; ODSs themselves 
account for 95%.
• Stratospheric ozone depletion has led to a negative radia-
tive forcing of about 0.15 W m–2 with a range of ±0.1 W m–2 
from different model estimates. Therefore the positive radia-
tive forcing due to the combined effect of all ODSs (0.32 W 
m–2) over the period 1750–2000 is larger than the negative 
forcing due to stratospheric ozone depletion. 
• Assuming that the observed changes in ozone are caused 
entirely by ODSs, the ozone radiative forcing can be con-
sidered an indirect forcing from the ODSs. However, there 
is evidence that some fraction of the observed global ozone 
changes cannot be attributed to ODSs, in which case the 
indirect forcing by ODSs would be weaker.
• The relative contributions of various halocarbons to posi-
tive direct and negative indirect forcing differ from gas to 
gas. Gases containing bromine (such as halons) are particu-
larly effective ozone depleters, so their relative contribution 
to negative forcing is greater than that of other ozone-de-
pleting gases, such as the CFCs.
• The same magnitudes of positive direct radiative forcing 
from halocarbons and of negative indirect forcing from 
ozone depletion are highly likely to have a different mag-
nitude of impact on global mean surface temperature. The 
climate responses will also have different spatial patterns. 
As a consequence, the two forcings do not simply offset one 
another. 
• Both the direct and indirect radiative forcings of ODSs 
will be reduced as a result of the Montreal Protocol. 
Nevertheless, these forcings are expected to remain signiﬁ-
cant during the next several decades. The precise change of 
each of the forcings will be affected by several factors, in-
cluding (1) the way climate change may affect stratospheric 
ozone chemistry and hence the ozone indirect radiative 
forcing; (2) future emissions of ODSs and their substitutes 
(see Chapter 2); and (3) continuing emissions from ‘ODS 
banks’ (ODSs that have already been manufactured but have 
not yet been released into the atmosphere).

Introduction
1.1.1 
Purpose and scope of this chapter
Ozone absorbs solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation (thereby warm-
ing the stratosphere) and is a greenhouse gas (thereby warming 
the troposphere). It thus plays an important role in the climate 
system. Furthermore, absorption of potentially damaging UV 
radiation by the stratospheric ozone layer protects life at the 
Earth’s surface. Stratospheric ozone amounts have been deplet-
ed in recent decades, following emission into the atmosphere 
of various ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), most of which 
are also greenhouse gases. The CFCs (chloroﬂuorocarbons) 
and halons, the major anthropogenic depleters of stratospheric 
ozone, are now controlled under the Montreal Protocol and its 
Amendments and Adjustments. They are being replaced by a 
variety of substances with lower ozone depletion potentials 
(ODPs) but that are generally still greenhouse gases, often 
with large global warming potentials (GWPs). The scientiﬁc 
connection between the different environmental problems of 
climate change and ozone depletion, and between the provi-
sions of the Montreal Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol (and the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
UNFCCC), is the subject of this chapter. 
 
The scientiﬁc issues are complex and the connections be-
tween the two problems more intricate than suggested above. 
For example, not only is ozone a greenhouse gas, so that any 
change in ozone abundance could have an impact on climate, 
but changes in climate could affect ozone in a number of differ-
ent ways. So, the ozone distribution in the future will depend, 
among other things, on the emission and impact of other green-
house gases and not just on those that deplete ozone. For this 
reason, ozone recovery following the reduction in atmospheric 
abundances of the ODSs will not be a simple return to the pre-
ozone-hole atmosphere (WMO, 1999, Chapter 12).
 
Climate change and ozone depletion have both been the 
subject of recent assessments (IPCC, 2001; WMO, 2003) de-
scribing the advances in understanding made in recent years. It 
is now well established, for example, that observed polar and 
mid-latitude ozone depletion is a consequence of the increase in 
stratospheric chlorine and bromine concentrations. The chemi-
cal processes involving these compounds and leading to polar 
ozone depletion are well understood. Similarly, the important 
role of ozone and the ODSs in the climate system has been 
documented. Stratospheric ozone depletion during recent de-
cades has represented a negative radiative forcing of the climate 
system; in contrast, the increase in ODSs has been a positive 
radiative forcing. These earlier reports form an important basis 
for this special report, which aims to address speciﬁcally the 
coupling between the chemistry and climate problems. In par-
ticular, this report will explore the scientiﬁc issues arising from 
the phase-out and replacement of ODSs as they affect strato-
spheric composition and climate change. The earlier reports did 
not have this particular emphasis (although the issues were ad-
dressed by a European Commission report (EC, 2003)).
 1.1.2 
Ozone in the atmosphere and its role in climate
Figure 1.1 illustrates a number of important concepts concern-
ing the ozone layer (Figure 1.1a) and its role in the stratosphere 
(the region between approximately 15 and 50 km altitude in 
which temperature rises with altitude, Figure 1.1b). Ozone, like 
water vapour and carbon dioxide, is an important and naturally 
occurring greenhouse gas; that is, it absorbs and emits radiation 
in the thermal infrared (Figure 1.1c), trapping heat to warm the 
Earth’s surface (Figure 1.1d). In contrast to the so-called well-
mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs), stratospheric ozone has 
two distinguishing properties. First, its relatively short chemi-
cal lifetime means that it is not uniformly mixed throughout the 
atmosphere and therefore its distribution is controlled by both 
dynamical and chemical processes (Section 1.3). In fact, unlike 
the WMGHGs, ozone is produced entirely within the atmos-
phere rather than being emitted into it. Second (Figure 1.1c), it 
is a very strong absorber of short wavelength UV radiation (it 
is also a weak absorber of visible radiation). The ozone layer’s 
absorption of this UV radiation leads to the characteristic in-
crease of temperature with altitude in the stratosphere and, in 
consequence, to a strong resistance to vertical motion. As well 
as ozone’s role in climate it also has more direct links to hu-
mans: its absorption of UV radiation protects much of Earth’s 
biota from this potentially damaging short wavelength radia-
tion. In contrast to the beneﬁts of stratospheric ozone, high sur-
face ozone values are detrimental to human health. 
 
The distribution of ozone in the atmosphere is maintained 
by a balance between photochemical production and loss, and 
by transport between regions of net production and net loss. 
A number of different chemical regimes can be identiﬁed for 
ozone. In the upper stratosphere, the ozone distribution arises 
from a balance between production following photolysis of mo-
lecular oxygen and destruction via a number of catalytic cycles 
involving hydrogen, nitrogen and halogen radical species (see 
Box 1.1). The halogens arise mainly from anthropogenic ODSs 
(the CFCs, HCFCs and halons). In the upper stratosphere, the 
rates of ozone destruction depend on temperature (a reduction in 
temperature slows the destruction of ozone, see Section 1.3.2) 
and on the concentrations of the radical species. In the lower 
stratosphere, reactions on aerosols become important. The dis-
tribution of the radicals (and the partitioning of the nitrogen, 
hydrogen and halogen species between radicals and ‘reservoirs’ 
that do not destroy ozone) can be affected by heterogeneous and 
multiphase chemistry acting on condensed matter (liquid and 
solid particles). At the low temperature of the wintertime polar 
lower stratosphere, this is the chemistry that leads to the ozone 
hole (see Box 1.1).
 
The large-scale circulation of the stratosphere, known as 
the Brewer-Dobson circulation (see Box 1.2), systematically 
transports ozone poleward and downward (ﬁgure in Box 1.2). 
Because ozone photochemical reactions proceed quickly in the 
sunlit upper stratosphere, this transport has little effect on the 
ozone distribution there as ozone removal by transport is quickly 
replenished by photochemical production. However, this trans-

Box 1.1. Ozone chemistry
Stratospheric ozone is produced naturally by photolysis of molecular oxygen (O2) at ultraviolet wavelengths below  
242 nm, 
  
O2 + hν → O + O 
[1]
The atomic oxygen produced in this reaction reacts rapidly with O2 to form ozone (O3),
  
O + O2 + M → O3 + M 
[2]
where M denotes a collision partner, not affected by the reaction. O3 itself is photolyzed rapidly,
  
O3 + hν → O + O2 
[3]
O3 and O establish a rapid photochemical equilibrium through Reactions [2] and [3], and together are called ‘odd oxygen’. 
Finally, in this sequence of reactions (known as the Chapman reactions), ozone is removed by
  
O + O3 → 2O2 
[4]
Destruction by Reaction [4] alone cannot explain observed ozone abundances in the stratosphere and it is now known that, 
away from polar latitudes, the ozone production through Reaction [1] is largely balanced by destruction in catalytic cycles 
of the form
  
XO + O → X + O2
  
X + O3 → XO + O2
   
Net: O + O3 → 2O2 
[Cycle 1]
The net reaction is equivalent to Reaction [4]. Note that, because O and O3 are in rapid photochemical equilibrium, the loss 
of one oxygen atom also effectively implies the loss of an ozone molecule, so that the cycle destroys two molecules of ‘odd 
oxygen’. Notice also that the catalyst, X, is not used up in the reaction cycle. The most important cycles of this type in the 
stratosphere involve reactive nitrogen (X = NO), halogen (X = Cl) and hydrogen (X = H, OH) radicals. In the lower strato-
sphere, cycles catalyzed by Br also contribute to the ozone loss. Owing to the large increase of O with altitude, the rates of 
these cycles increase substantially between 25 and 40 km, as does the rate of ozone production.
In polar regions, the abundance of ClO is greatly enhanced during winter as a result of reactions on the surfaces of polar 
stratospheric cloud particles that form at the low temperatures found there. However, atomic oxygen, O, has very low 
concentrations there, which limits the efﬁciency of Cycle 1. In that case, two other catalytic cycles become the dominant 
reaction mechanisms for polar ozone loss. The ﬁrst, the so-called ClO dimer cycle, is initiated by the reaction of ClO with 
another ClO, 
  
ClO + ClO + M → (ClO)2 + M
  
(ClO)2 + hν → ClOO + Cl
  
ClOO + M → Cl + O2 + M
  
2 (Cl + O3 → ClO + O2)
  
Net: 2O3 → 3O2 
[Cycle 2]
and the second, the ClO-BrO cycle, is initiated by the reaction of ClO with BrO:
  
ClO + BrO → Cl + Br + O2
  
Cl + O3 → ClO + O2
  
Br + O3 → BrO + O2
  
Net: 2O3 → 3O2 
[Cycle 3]
The net result of both Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 is to destroy two ozone molecules and to produce three oxygen molecules. Both 
cycles are catalytic, as chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) are not lost in the cycles. Sunlight is required to complete the cycles 
and to help maintain the large ClO abundance. Cycles 2 and 3 account for most of the ozone loss observed in the late win-
ter-spring season in the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. At high ClO abundances, the rate of ozone destruction can reach 
2 to 3% per day in late winter-spring. Outside the polar regions the ClO-BrO cycle is of minor importance because of much 
lower ClO concentrations, and the effect of the ClO dimer cycle is negligible as the cycle is only effective at the low polar 
temperatures.

port leads to signiﬁcant variations of ozone in the extra-tropical 
lower stratosphere, where the photochemical relaxation time is 
very long (several months or longer) and ozone can accumulate 
on seasonal time scales. Due to the seasonality of the Brewer-
Dobson circulation (maximum during winter and spring), ozone 
builds up in the extra-tropical lower stratosphere during winter 
and spring through transport, and then decays photochemically 
during the summer when transport is weaker. The column- 
ozone distribution (measured in Dobson units, DU) is domi-
nated by its distribution in the lower stratosphere and reﬂects 
this seasonality (Figure 1.2). Furthermore, planetary waves 
are stronger (and more variable) in the Northern Hemisphere 
(NH) than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), because of the 
asymmetric distribution of the surface features (topography and 
land-sea thermal contrasts) that, in combination with surface 
winds, force the waves. Accordingly, the stratospheric Brewer-
Dobson circulation is stronger during the NH winter, and the 
resulting extra-tropical build-up of ozone during the winter and 
spring is greater in the NH than in the SH (Andrews et al., 1987; 
Figure 1.2).
 
Variations in the Brewer-Dobson circulation also inﬂuence 
polar temperatures in the lower stratosphere (via the vertical 
motions); stronger wave forcing coincides with enhanced cir-
culation and higher polar temperatures (and more ozone trans-
Box 1.2. Stratospheric transport, planetary waves and the Brewer-Dobson circulation
The stratospheric Brewer-Dobson circulation consists of rising motion in the tropics and sinking motion in the extratrop-
ics, together with an associated poleward mass ﬂux. Its effect on chemical species is complemented by mixing (mainly 
quasi-horizontal) that acts to transport air parcels both poleward and equatorward. Both processes are primarily driven by 
mechanical forcing (wave drag) arising from the dissipation of planetary-scale waves in the stratosphere. These planetary 
waves are generated in the troposphere by topographic and thermal forcing, and by synoptic meteorological activity, and 
propagate vertically into the stratosphere. Because of ﬁltering by the large-scale stratospheric winds, vertical propagation 
of planetary waves into the stratosphere occurs primarily during winter, and this seasonality in wave forcing accounts for 
the winter maximum in the Brewer-Dobson circulation. In the case of ozone, the Brewer-Dobson circulation (together with 
the associated horizontal mixing) transports ozone poleward and downward and leads to a springtime maximum in extra-
tropical ozone abundance (see ﬁgure).
Because air enters the stratosphere primarily in the tropics, the physical and chemical characteristics of air near the tropical 
tropopause behave as boundary conditions for the global stratosphere. For example, dehydration of air near the cold tropical 
tropopause accounts for the extreme dryness of the global stratosphere (Brewer, 1949). Overall, the region of the tropical 
atmosphere between about 12 km and the altitude of the tropopause (about 17 km) has characteristics intermediate to those 
of the troposphere and stratosphere, and is referred to as the tropical tropopause layer (TTL).

port). Since temperature affects ozone chemistry, dynamical 
and chemical effects on column ozone thus tend to act in con-
cert and are coupled.
 
Human activities have led to changes in the atmospheric 
concentrations of several greenhouse gases, including tropo-
spheric and stratospheric ozone and ODSs and their substitutes. 
Changes to the concentrations of these gases alter the radiative 
balance of the Earth’s atmosphere by changing the balance be-
tween incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation. 
Such an alteration in the Earth’s radiative balance is called a 
radiative forcing. This report, past IPCC reports and climate 
change protocols have universally adopted the concept of ra-
diative forcing as a tool to gauge and contrast surface climate 
change caused by different mechanisms (see Box 1.3). Positive 
radiative forcings are expected to warm the Earth’s surface and 
negative radiative forcings are expected to cool it. The radiative 
forcings from the principal greenhouse gases are summarized 
in Figure 1.3 and Table 1.1 (in Section 1.5.2). Other signiﬁcant 
contributors to radiative forcing that are not shown in Figure 1.3 
include tropospheric aerosol changes and changes in the Sun’s 
output. Changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) provide the largest 
radiative forcing term and are expected to be the largest overall 
contributor to climate change. In contrast with the positive ra-
diative forcings due to increases in other greenhouse gases, the 
radiative forcing due to stratospheric ozone depletion is nega-
tive.
 
Halocarbons are particularly effective greenhouse gases in 
part because they absorb the Earth’s outgoing infrared radia-
tion in a spectral range where energy is not removed by carbon 
dioxide or water vapour (sometimes referred to as the atmos-
pheric window). Halocarbon molecules can be many thousands 
of times more efﬁcient at absorbing the radiant energy emitted 
from the Earth than a molecule of carbon dioxide, which ex-
plains why relatively small amounts of these gases can con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to radiative forcing of the climate system. 
Because halocarbons have low concentrations and absorb in 
the atmospheric window, the magnitude of the direct radiative 
forcing from a halocarbon is given by the product of its tropo-
spheric mixing ratio and its radiative efﬁciency. In contrast, for 
the more abundant greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane 
and nitrous oxide) there is a nonlinear relationship between the 
mixing ratio and the radiative forcing.
 
Since 1970 the growth in halocarbon concentrations and the 
changes in ozone concentrations (depletion in the stratosphere 
and increases in the troposphere) have been very signiﬁcant 
contributors to the total radiative forcing of the Earth’s atmos-
phere. Because halocarbons have likely caused most of the 
stratospheric ozone loss (see Section 1.4.1), there is the possi-
bility of a partial offset between the positive forcing of halocar-
bon that are ODSs and the negative forcing from stratospheric 
ozone loss. This is discussed further in Section 1.5.
 
The climate impacts of ozone changes are not conﬁned to 
the surface: stratospheric ozone changes are probably respon-
sible for a signiﬁcant fraction of the observed cooling in the 
lower stratosphere over the last two decades (Section 1.2.4) and 
may alter atmospheric dynamics and chemistry (Section 1.3.6). 
Further, it was predicted that depletion of stratospheric ozone 
would lead to a global increase in erythemal UV radiation (the 
radiation that causes sunburn) at the surface of about 3%, with 
much larger increases at high latitudes; these predicted high lat-

largely a result of the stratospheric ozone depletion, which resulted 
from halocarbon emissions between 1970 and 2000; it can therefore 
be considered an indirect radiative forcing from halocarbons, which 
offsets their positive direct forcing. In contrast, the tropospheric ozone 
radiative forcing is largely independent of the halocarbon forcing.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Box 1.3. Radiative forcing and climate sensitivity
Radiative forcing is a useful tool for estimating the relative climate impacts, in the global mean, of different climate change 
mechanisms. Radiative forcing uses the notion that the globally averaged radiative forcing (ΔF) is related to the globally 
averaged equilibrium surface temperature change (ΔTs) through the climate sensitivity (λ):
  
ΔTs = λΔF
The reason surface temperature changes in different models are not usually compared directly is that the climate sensitivity 
is poorly known and varies by a factor of three between different climate models (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 9). Further, climate 
model studies have shown that, for many forcing mechanisms, λ in an individual climate model is more or less independent 
of the mechanism. These two factors enable the climate change potential of different mechanisms to be quantitatively con-
trasted through their radiative forcings, while they remain difﬁcult to compare through their predicted surface temperature 
changes. Unfortunately, certain radiative forcings, including ozone changes, have been shown to have different climate 
sensitivities compared with carbon dioxide changes (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 6; WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). One of the reasons 
for this difference is that some aspects of the radiative forcing deﬁnition, such as tropopause height, have a large impact on 
the ozone radiative forcing (see below). These factors are the main reasons for the large uncertainty in the ozone radiative 
forcing and the global mean climate response.
Why is the radiative forcing of stratospheric ozone negative?
The radiative forcing is deﬁned as the change in net radiative ﬂux at the tropopause after allowing for stratospheric tempera-
tures to readjust to radiative equilibrium (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 6). The details of this deﬁnition are crucial for stratospheric 
ozone, and are explained in the ﬁgure.

Box 1.3, Figure. The instantaneous effect of stratospheric ozone depletion (left-hand side of schematic) is to increase the shortwave radiation 
from the Sun reaching the tropopause (because there is less ozone to absorb it), and to slightly reduce the downward longwave radiation 
from the stratosphere, as there is less ozone in the stratosphere to emit radiation. This gives an instantaneous net positive radiative forcing. 
However, in response to less absorption of both shortwave and longwave radiation in the stratosphere, the region cools, which leads to an 
overall reduction of thermal radiation emitted downward from the stratosphere (right-hand side of schematic). The size of this adjustment 
term depends on the vertical proﬁle of ozone change and is largest for changes near the tropopause. For the observed stratospheric ozone 
changes the adjustment term is larger than the positive instantaneous term, thus the stratospheric ozone radiative forcing is negative.

Our aim in this chapter is to review the scientiﬁc understanding 
of the interactions between ozone and climate. We interpret the 
term ‘climate’ broadly, to include stratospheric temperature and 
circulation, and refer to tropospheric effects as ‘tropospheric 
climate’. This is a broad topic; our review will take a more re-
stricted view concentrating on the interactions as they relate to 
stratospheric ozone and the role of the ODSs and their substi-
tutes. For this reason the role of tropospheric ozone in the cli-
mate system is mentioned only brieﬂy. Similarly, some broader 
issues, including possible changes in stratospheric water vapour 
(where the role of the ODSs and their substitutes should be 
minor) and climate-dependent changes in biogenic emissions 
(whose ﬁrst order effect is likely to be in the troposphere), will 
not be discussed in any detail. The relationship between ozone 
and the solar cycle is well established, and the solar cycle has 
been used as an explanatory variable in ozone trend analysis. 
The connection between ozone and the solar cycle was assessed 
most recently in Chapter 12 of WMO (1999) and will not be 
discussed further here.
 
Section 1.2 presents an update on stratospheric observations 
of ozone, ozone-related species and temperature. Section 1.3 
considers, at a process level, the various feedbacks connecting 
stratospheric ozone and the climate system. The understand-
ing of these processes leads, in Section 1.4, to a discussion of 
the attribution of past changes in ozone, the prediction of fu-
ture changes, and the connection of both with climate. Finally, 
Section 1.5 reviews the trade-offs between ozone depletion and 
radiative forcing, focusing on ODSs and their substitutes.

Observed changes in the stratosphere
1.2.1 
Observed changes in stratospheric ozone
Global and hemispheric-scale variations in stratospheric ozone 
can be quantiﬁed from extensive observational records covering 
the past 20 to 30 years. There are numerous ways to measure 
ozone in the atmosphere, but they fall broadly into two catego-
ries: measurements of column ozone (the vertically integrated 
amount of ozone above the surface), and measurements of the 
vertical proﬁle of ozone. Approximately 90% of the vertically 
integrated ozone column resides in the stratosphere. There are 
more independent measurements, longer time-series, and bet-
ter global coverage for column ozone. Regular measurements 
of column ozone are available from a network of surface sta-
tions, mostly in the mid-latitude NH, with reasonable coverage 
extending back to the 1960s. Near-global, continuous column 
ozone data are available from satellite measurements beginning 
in 1979. The different observational data sets can be used to 
estimate past ozone changes, and the differences between data 
sets provide a lower bound of overall uncertainty. The differ-
ences indicate good overall agreement between different data 
sources for changes in column ozone, and thus we have reason-
able conﬁdence in describing the spatial and temporal charac-
teristics of past changes (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). 
 
Five data sets of zonal and monthly mean column ozone 
values developed by different scientiﬁc teams were used to 
quantify past ozone changes in Chapter 4 of WMO (2003); 
they include ground-based measurements covering 1964–2001, 
and several different satellite data sets extending in time over 
1979–2001. Figure 1.4a shows globally averaged column ozone 
changes derived from each of these data sets, updated through 
2004. The analyses ﬁrst remove the seasonal cycle from each

50 hPa layer (about 16–22 km), and are derived from the HadRT and 
LKS data sets described in Seidel et al. (2004). Satellite temperatures 
(available for 1979–2003) are from the Microwave Sounding Unit 
Channel 4, and represent mean temperature in a layer over about 13–
22 km. For direct comparison, the satellite data have been normalized 
to equal the radiosonde time means over 1979–1997. Panel (b) is 
discussed in Section 1.2.4.

data set (mean and linear trend), and the deviations are area 
weighted and expressed as anomalies with respect to the pe-
riod 1964–1980. The global ozone amount shows decreasing 
values between the late 1970s and the early 1990s, a relative 
minimum during 1992–1994, and slightly increasing values 
during the late 1990s. Global ozone for the period 1997–2004 
was approximately 3% below the 1964–1980 average values. 
Since systematic global observations began in the mid-1960s, 
the lowest annually averaged global ozone occurred during 
1992–1993 (5% below the 1964–1980 average). These changes 
are evident in each of the available global data sets.
 
The global ozone changes shown in Figure 1.4a occur main-
ly in the extratropics of both hemispheres (poleward of 25°–
35°). No signiﬁcant long-term changes in column ozone have 
been observed in the tropics (25°N to 25°S). Column ozone 
changes averaged over mid-latitudes (from 35° to 60° latitude) 
are signiﬁcantly larger in the SH than in the NH; averaged for 
the period 1997–2001, SH values are 6% below pre-1980 val-
ues, whereas NH values are 3% lower. Also, there is signiﬁcant 
seasonality to the NH mid-latitude losses (4% losses in the win-
ter-spring period and 2% in summer), whereas long-term SH 
losses are about 6% year round (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4).
 
The most dramatic changes in ozone have occurred during 
the spring season over Antarctica, with the development during 
the 1980s of a phenomenon known as the ozone hole (Figure 
1.5). The ozone hole now recurs every spring, with some inter-
annual variability and occasional extreme behaviour (see Box 
1.6 in Section 1.4.1). In most years the ozone concentration 
is reduced to nearly zero over a layer several kilometres deep 
within the lower stratosphere in the Antarctic polar vortex. Since

63°S has been more than 100 DU below pre-ozone-hole values 
(a 40 to 50% decrease), with up to a 70% local decrease for 
periods of a week or so (WMO, 2003, Chapter 3; Figure 1.6). 
 
Compared with the Antarctic, Arctic ozone abundance in 
the winter and spring is highly variable (Figure 1.6), because 
of interannual variability in chemical loss and in dynamical 
transport. Dynamical variability within the winter stratosphere 
leads to changes in ozone transport to high latitudes, and these 
transport changes are correlated with polar temperature vari-
ability – with less ozone transport being associated with lower 
temperatures. Low temperatures favour halogen-induced chem-
ical ozone loss. Thus, in recent decades, halogen-induced po-
lar ozone chemistry has acted in concert with the dynamically 
induced ozone variability, and has led to Arctic column ozone 
losses of up to 30% in particularly cold winters (WMO, 2003, 
Chapter 3). In particularly dynamically active, warm winters, 
however, the estimated chemical ozone loss has been very 
small.
 
Changes in the vertical proﬁle of ozone are derived primarily 
from satellites, ground-based measurements and balloon-borne 
ozonesondes. Long records from ground-based and balloon 
data are available mainly for stations over NH mid-latitudes. 
Ozone proﬁle changes over NH mid-latitudes exhibit two maxi-
ma, with decreasing trends in the upper stratosphere (about 7% 
per decade at 35–45 km) and in the lower stratosphere (about 
5% per decade at 15–25 km) during the period 1979–2000. 
Ozone proﬁle trends show a minimum (about 2% per decade 
decrease) near 30 km. The vertically integrated proﬁle trends 
are in agreement with the measured changes in column ozone 
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 4).

chlorinated solvents and brominated gases at the Earth’s surface. Also shown are measured annual means (circles) that are based on results from 
two independent, global sampling networks (an update of Figure 1-22 of WMO, 2003) for all gases except CH3Br. Global surface means for 
CH3Br are taken from Khalil et al. (1993) for the years before 1992, and from Montzka et al. (2003) for 1996–2003. Panel (d) shows past and 
potential future changes in the total ozone-depleting halogen burden of the stratosphere, estimated as equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine 
(EESC). The EESC values are derived from the baseline scenario Ab (line) or surface measurements (circles). EESC is derived from measured 
surface mixing ratios of the most abundant CFCs, HCFCs, chlorinated solvents, halons and methyl bromide; it is based on the assumption of 
a 3-year time lag between the troposphere and mid-stratosphere and a factor of 45 to account for the enhanced reactivity of Br relative to Cl in 
depleting stratospheric ozone (Daniel et al., 1999).

1.2.2 
Observed changes in ODSs
As a result of reduced emissions because of the Montreal 
Protocol and its Amendments and Adjustments, mixing ratios 
for most ODSs have stopped increasing near the Earth’s surface 
(Montzka et al., 1999; Prinn et al., 2000). The response to the 
Protocol, however, is reﬂected in quite different observed be-
haviour for different substances. By 2003, the mixing ratios for 
CFC-12 were close to their peak, CFC-11 had clearly decreased, 
while methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) had dropped by 80% from 
its maximum (Figure 1.7; see also Chapter 1 of WMO, 2003).
 
Halons and HCFCs are among the few ODSs whose mix-
ing ratios were still increasing in 2000 (Montzka et al., 2003; 
O’Doherty et al., 2004). Halons contain bromine, which is on 
average 40 to 50 times more efﬁcient on a per-atom basis at 
destroying stratospheric ozone than chlorine. However, growth 
rates for most halons have steadily decreased during recent 
years (Fraser et al., 1999; Montzka et al., 2003). Furthermore, 
increases in tropospheric bromine from halons have been offset 
by the decline observed for methyl bromide (CH3Br) since 1998 
(Yokouchi et al., 2002; Montzka et al., 2003; Simmonds et al., 
2004). 
 
Atmospheric amounts of HCFCs continue to increase be-
cause of their use as CFC substitutes (Figure 1.7b). Chlorine 
from HCFCs has increased at a fairly constant rate of 10 ppt 
Cl yr–1 since 1996, although HCFCs accounted for only 5% of 
all chlorine from long-lived gases in the atmosphere by 2000 
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 1). The ODPs of the most abundant 
HCFCs are only about 5–10% of those of the CFCs (Table 1.2 
in Section 1.5.3).
 
Figure 1.8 contrasts the observed atmospheric abundances 
of CFC-11 with those of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a. The behav-
iour of CFC-11 is representative of the behaviour of CFCs in 
general, and the behaviour of HCFC-22 and HFC-134a is rep-
resentative of HCFCs (as well as HFCs) in general (see Figure 
2.3 in Chapter 2). The most rapid growth rates of CFC-11 oc-
curred in the 1970s and 1980s. The largest emissions were in 
the NH, and concentrations in the SH lagged behind those in 
the NH, consistent with an inter-hemispheric mixing time scale 
of about 1 to 2 years. In recent years, following the implemen-
tation of the Montreal Protocol, the observed growth rate has 
declined, concentrations appear to be at their peak and, as emis-
sions have declined, the inter-hemispheric gradient has almost 
disappeared. In contrast, HCFC-22 and HFC-134a concentra-
tions are still growing rapidly and there is a marked inter-hemi-
spheric gradient.
 
Ground-based observations suggest that by 2003 the cu-
mulative totals of both chlorine- and bromine-containing gases 
regulated by the Montreal Protocol were decreasing in the lower 
atmosphere (Montzka et al., 2003). Although tropospheric chlo-
rine levels peaked in the early 1990s and have since declined, 
atmospheric bromine began decreasing in 1998 (Montzka et al., 
2003).
 
The net effect of changes in the abundance of both chlo-
rine and bromine on the total ozone-depleting halogens in the 
stratosphere is estimated roughly by calculating the equivalent 
effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC; Daniel et al., 1995) 
(Figure 1.7d). The calculation of EESC (see Box 1.8 in Section 
1.5.3) includes consideration of the total amount of chlorine 
and bromine accounted for by long-lived halocarbons, how 
rapidly these halocarbons degrade and release their halogen in 
the stratosphere and a nominal lag time of three years to al-
low for transport from the troposphere into the stratosphere. 
The tropospheric observational data suggest that EESC peaked 
in the mid-1990s and has been decreasing at a mean rate of 
22 ppt yr–1 (0.7% yr–1) over the past eight years (Chapter 1 of 
WMO, 2003). Direct stratospheric measurements show that 
stratospheric chlorine reached a broad plateau after 1996, char-
acterized by variability (Rinsland et al., 2003).

vapour, methane and nitrous oxide

(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Observed variations in these 
constituents are summarized in this section.
 
During the past three decades, aerosol loading in the strato-
sphere has primarily reﬂected the effects of a few volcanic 
eruptions that inject aerosol and its gaseous precursors (primar-
ily sulphur dioxide, SO2) into the stratosphere. The most note-
worthy of these eruptions are El Chichón (1982) and Pinatubo 
(1991). The 1991 Pinatubo eruption likely had the largest im-
pact of any event in the 20th century (McCormick et al., 1995), 
producing about 30 Tg of aerosol (compared with approximate-
ly 12 Tg from El Chichón) that persisted into at least the late 
1990s. Current aerosol loading, which is at the lowest observed 
levels, is less than 0.5 Tg, so the Pinatubo event represents near-
ly a factor of 100 enhancement relative to non-volcanic levels. 
The source of the non-volcanic stratospheric aerosol is primar-
ily carbonyl sulﬁde (OCS), and there is general agreement be-
tween the aerosols estimated by modelling the transformation 
of observed OCS to sulphate aerosols and observed aerosols. 
However, there is a signiﬁcant dearth of SO2 measurements, 
and the role of tropospheric SO2 in the stratospheric aerosol 
budget – while signiﬁcant – remains a matter of some uncer-
tainty. Because of the high variability of stratospheric aerosol 
loading it is difﬁcult to detect trends in the non-volcanic aerosol 
component. Trends derived from the late 1970s to the current 
period are likely to encompass a value of zero.
 
The recent Stratospheric Processes And their Role in Climate 
(SPARC) Assessment of Upper Tropospheric and Stratospheric 
Water Vapour (SPARC, 2000) provided an extensive review of 
data sources and quality for stratospheric water vapour, togeth-
er with detailed analyses of observed seasonal and interannual 
variability. The longest continuous reliable data set is at a single 
location (Boulder, Colorado, USA), is based on balloon-borne 
frost-point hygrometer measurements (approximately one per 
month), and dates back to 1980. Over the period 1980–2000, a 
statistically signiﬁcant positive trend of approximately 1% yr–1 
is observed at all levels between about 15 and 26 km in alti-
tude (SPARC, 2000; Oltmans et al., 2000). However, although 
a linear trend can be ﬁtted to these data, there is a high degree 
of variability in the infrequent sampling, and the increases are 
neither continuous nor steady (Figure 1.9). Long-term increases 
in stratospheric water vapour are also inferred from a number 
of other ground-based, balloon, aircraft and satellite data sets 
spanning approximately 1980–2000 (Rosenlof et al., 2001), al-
though the time records are short and the sampling uncertainty 
is high in many cases.
 
Global stratospheric water vapour measurements have been 
made by the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) sa-
tellite instrument for more than a decade (late 1991 to 2004). 
Interannual changes in water vapour derived from HALOE 
data show excellent agreement with Polar Ozone and Aerosol 
Measurement (POAM) satellite data, and also exhibit strong co-
herence with tropical tropopause temperature changes (Randel 
et al., 2004). An updated comparison of the HALOE measure-
ments with the Boulder balloon data for the period 1992–2004 
is shown in Figure 1.9. The Boulder and HALOE data show 
reasonable agreement for the early part of the record (1992–
1996), but there is an offset after 1997, with the Boulder data 
showing higher values than HALOE measurements. As a result, 
linear trends derived from these two data sets for the (short) 
period 1992–2004 show very different results (increases for the 
Boulder data, but not for HALOE). The reason for the differ-
ences between the balloon and satellite data (for the same time 
period and location) is unclear at present, but the discrepancy 
calls into question interpretation of water vapour trends derived 
from short or infrequently sampled data records. It will be im-
portant to reconcile these differences because these data sets are 
the two longest and most continuous data records available for 
stratospheric water vapour.
 
It is a challenge to explain the magnitude of the water va-
pour increases seen in the Boulder frost-point data. Somewhat 
less than half the observed increase of about 10% per decade 
(through 2001) can be explained as a result of increasing tropo-
spheric methane (transported to the stratosphere and oxidized to 
form water vapour). The remaining increase could be reconciled 
with a warming of the tropical tropopause of approximately 1 K 
per decade, assuming that air entered the stratosphere with wa-
ter vapour in equilibrium with ice. However, observations sug-
gest that the tropical tropopause has cooled slightly for this time 
period, by approximately 0.5 K per decade, and risen slightly 
in altitude by about 20 m per decade (e.g., Seidel et al., 2001; 
Zhou et al., 2001). Although regional-scale processes may also 
inﬂuence stratospheric water vapour (such as summer monsoon 
circulations, e.g., Potter and Holton, 1995), there is no evidence

for increases in tropopause temperature in these regions either 
(Seidel et al., 2001). From this perspective, the extent of the 
decadal water vapour increases inferred from the Boulder meas-
urements is inconsistent with the observed tropical tropopause 
cooling, and this inconsistency limits conﬁdence in predicting 
the future evolution of stratospheric water vapour.
 
The atmospheric abundance of methane has increased by 
a factor of about 2.5 since the pre-industrial era (IPCC, 2001, 
Chapter 4). Measurements of methane from a global monitoring 
network showed increasing values through the 1990s, but ap-
proximately constant values during 1999–2002 (Dlugokencky 
et al., 2003). Changes in stratospheric methane have been 
monitored on a global scale using HALOE satellite measure-
ments since 1991. The HALOE data show increases in lower 
stratospheric methane during 1992–1997 that are in reasonable 
agreement with tropospheric increases during this time (Randel 
et al., 1999). In the upper stratosphere the HALOE data show 
an overall decrease in methane since 1991, which is likely at-
tributable to a combination of chemical and dynamical inﬂu-
ences (Nedoluha et al., 1998; Considine et al., 2001; Röckmann 
et al., 2004).
 
Measurements of tropospheric N2O show a consistent in-
crease of about 3% per decade (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 4). Because 
tropospheric air is transported into the stratosphere, these posi-
tive N2O trends produce increases in stratospheric reactive ni-
trogen (NOy), which plays a key role in ozone photochemistry. 
Measurements of stratospheric column NO2 (a main component 
of NOy) from the SH (1980–2000) and the NH (1985–2000) 
mid-latitudes (about 45°) show long-term increases of approxi-
mately 6% per decade (Liley et al., 2000; WMO, 2003, Chapter 
4), and these are reconciled with the N2O changes by consider-
ing effects of changing levels of stratospheric ozone, water va-
pour and halogens (Fish et al., 2000; McLinden et al., 2001).
1.2.4 
Observed temperature changes in the stratosphere
There is strong evidence of a large and signiﬁcant cooling in 
most of the stratosphere since 1980. Recent updates to the 
observed changes in stratospheric temperature and to the un-
derstanding of those changes have been presented in Chapters 
3 and 4 of WMO (2003). Current long-term monitoring of  
stratospheric temperature relies on satellite instruments and  
radiosonde analyses. The Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) 
and Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) instruments record 
temperatures in several 10–15 km thick layers between 17 and 
50 km in altitude. Radiosonde trend analyses are available up 
to altitudes of roughly 25 km. Determining accurate trends with 
these data sets is difﬁcult. In particular the radiosonde coverage 
is not global and suffers from data quality concerns, whereas 
the satellite trend data is a result of merging data sets from se-
veral different instruments. Figure 1.4b shows global tempera-
ture time-series in the lower and middle stratosphere derived 
from satellites and radiosondes. It reveals a strong imprint of 
1 to 2 years of warming following the volcanic eruptions of 
Agung (1963), El Chichón (1982) and Mt. Pinatubo (1991). 
When these years are excluded from long-term trend analyses, 
a signiﬁcant global cooling is seen in both the radiosonde and 
the satellite records over the last few decades. This cooling 
is signiﬁcant (at the 97% level or greater) at all levels of the 
stratosphere except the 30 km (10 hPa) level in the SSU record 
(Figure 1.10). The largest global cooling is found in the upper 
stratosphere, where it is fairly uniform in time at a rate of about 
2 K per decade (for 1979–1997). In the lower stratosphere (be-
low 25 km) this long-term global cooling manifests itself as 
more of a step-like change following the volcanic warming 
events (Figure 1.4b). The cooling also varies with latitude. The 
lower stratosphere extratropics (from 20° to 60° latitude) show 
a cooling of 0.4–0.8 K per decade in both hemispheres, which 
remains roughly constant throughout the year. At high latitudes 
most of the cooling, up to 2 K per decade for both hemispheres, 
occurs during spring.
 
Much recent progress has been made in modelling these tem-
perature trends (see Shine et al., 2003; WMO, 2003, Chapters 
3 and 4). Models range from one-dimensional (1-D) ﬁxed dy-
namical heating rate (FDH) calculations to three-dimensional 
(3-D) coupled chemistry-climate models; many of their ﬁnd-
ings are presented later in this chapter. FDH is a simple way of 
determining the radiative response to an imposed change whilst 
‘ﬁxing’ the background dynamical heating to its climatological 
value; this makes the calculation of temperature change sim-
pler, as only a radiation model needs to be used. Changes in 
dynamical circulations simulated by models can lead to effects 
over latitudinal bands, which vary between models. However, 
dynamics cannot easily produce a global mean temperature 
change. Because of this, global mean temperature is radiative-
ly controlled and provides an important focus for attribution 
(Figure 1.10). For the global mean in the upper stratosphere the 
models suggest roughly equal contributions to the cooling from 
ozone decreases and carbon dioxide increases. In the global 
mean mid-stratosphere there appears to be some discrepancy 
between the SSU and modelled trends near 30 km: models pre-
dict a deﬁnite radiative cooling from carbon dioxide at these 
altitudes, which is not evident in the SSU record. In the lower 
stratosphere the cooling from carbon dioxide is much smaller 
than higher in the stratosphere. Although ozone depletion prob-
ably accounts for up to half of the observed cooling trend, it 
appears that a signiﬁcant cooling from another mechanism may 
be needed to account for the rest of the observed cooling. One 
possible cause of this extra cooling could be stratospheric water 
vapour increases. However, stratospheric water vapour changes 
are currently too uncertain (see Section 1.2.3) to pinpoint their 
precise role. Tropospheric ozone increases have probably con-
tributed slightly to lower stratospheric cooling by reducing up-
welling thermal radiation; one estimate suggests a cooling of 
0.05 K per decade at 50 hPa and a total cooling of up to 0.5 K 
over the last century (Sexton et al., 2003). The springtime cool-
ing in the Antarctic lower stratosphere is almost certainly nearly 
all caused by stratospheric ozone depletion. However, the simi-
lar magnitude of cooling in the Arctic spring does not seem to 
be solely caused by ozone changes, which are much smaller

than in the Antarctic; interannual variability may contribute 
substantially to the cooling observed in the Arctic wintertime 
(see Section 1.4.1). 
 
One mechanism for altering temperatures in the upper  
troposphere and lower stratosphere comes from the direct radia-
tive effects of halocarbons (WMO, 1986; Ramaswamy et al., 
1996; Hansen et al., 1997). In contrast with the role of carbon 
dioxide, halocarbons can actually warm the upper tropospheric 
and lower stratospheric region (see Box 1.4).
 
In summary, stratospheric temperature changes over the 
past few decades are signiﬁcant (they are, in fact, substantially 
larger than those seen in the surface temperature record over 
the same period), and there are clear quantiﬁable features of 
the contributions from ozone, carbon dioxide and volcanism in 
the past stratospheric temperature record. More deﬁnite attribu-
tion of the causes of these trends is limited by the short time-
series. Future increases of carbon dioxide can be expected to 
substantially cool the upper stratosphere. However, this cooling 
could be partially offset by any future ozone increase (Section 
1.4.2). In the lower stratosphere, both ozone recovery and halo-
carbon increases would warm this region compared with the 
present. Any changes in stratospheric water vapour or changes 
in tropospheric conditions, such as high-cloud properties and 
tropospheric ozone, would also affect future temperatures in 
the lower stratosphere. Furthermore, circulation changes can 
affect temperatures over sub-global scales, especially at mid- 
and polar latitudes. Several studies have modelled parts of these 
expected temperature changes, and are discussed in the rest of 
this chapter (see especially Section 1.4.2).
1.3 
Stratospheric ozone and climate feedback 
processes
The distribution of ozone depends on a balance between chemi-
cal processes, which can be affected by changes in the concen-
tration of the ODSs, and transport processes, which can be af-
fected by climate change. Climate change, in its broadest sense, 
can also affect ozone chemistry directly by modifying the rates 
of temperature-dependent reactions. These interactions are 
discussed in Sections 1.3.1 to 1.3.4. In these sections we also 
discuss the possible impact on ozone of changing stratospheric 
water vapour abundances, which may be regulated by climate.
 
Changes in stratospheric ozone can also affect climate. The 
impact of ozone changes on stratospheric temperatures has 
already been discussed in Section 1.2.4. As well as the direct 
impact of ozone as an absorber of UV radiation and as a green-
house gas, there are other effects that could be important. For 
example, changes in ozone could affect the lifetime of reactive

Box 1.4. Halocarbons and the tropical tropopause
Halocarbons and carbon dioxide are greenhouse gases: they trap longwave radiation to warm the Earth’s surface. However, 
compared with carbon dioxide halocarbons have quite different spectral absorption characteristics and they interact very 
differently with the Earth’s radiation ﬁeld. The very strong 15 µm band dominates the role of carbon dioxide, whereas the 
halocarbons tend to absorb weakly in the 8–13 µm atmospheric window, a region of the spectrum where other gases have 
only a small effect on outgoing longwave radiation. These absorption properties, combined with a typical vertical tempera-
ture proﬁle, means that halocarbons usually warm the atmosphere locally, whereas carbon dioxide generally cools it (the at-
mosphere only warms as a response to the induced surface warming). Further, this effect is largest at the tropical tropopause 
(about 17 km altitude), where temperatures are most different from those of the underlying surface (e.g., Dickinson, 1978; 
Wang et al., 1991). The tropical tropopause can be deﬁned as the height at which the coldest temperatures are found in a 
vertical temperature proﬁle (see Figure 1.1b). The effects of halocarbon, carbon dioxide and ozone changes are contrasted 
in the ﬁgure in this box.
Panel (a) shows that halocarbons may have warmed the tropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere by as much as 0.3 
K, which is locally larger than the cooling effects of carbon dioxide. For the calculation of a globally averaged temperature 
change this warming can be thought of as partially cancelling 
out the cooling effect of ozone depletion in the extra-tropical 
lower stratosphere. However, the patterns are quite distinct 
(compare panels (a) and (b)), and as a result the equator-to-
pole temperature gradient in the lower stratosphere, where 
temperature increases towards higher latitudes, would be re-
duced. 
Although halocarbons are potentially important, because of 
their coupling to water vapour, it is unlikely that halocarbons 
dominate the response of the tropical tropopause to changing 
greenhouse gases, as there is some observational evidence 
for a general cooling of the tropical tropopause over the last 
few decades (Seidel et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2001).

greenhouse gases, by changing the penetration of UV radiation. 
Changes in the structure of the stratosphere, caused by ozone 
changes, could alter the interaction between the troposphere 
and stratosphere and lead to further changes in stratospheric 
ozone. These latter interactions are discussed in Sections 1.3.5 
and 1.3.6.
 
Improved knowledge of these various feedback processes is 
essential for informing the numerical models used to predict fu-
ture chemistry-climate interactions; these models are discussed 
in Section 1.4.
 
Note that other factors, which are not discussed in detail 
here, can also affect the interaction between ozone and climate. 
Perhaps the most obvious is the impact of major volcanic erup-
tions. These can lead to an increase in volcanic aerosol in the 
stratosphere, which can inﬂuence both climate and the chemical 
processes controlling the ozone layer.
1.3.1 
Impact of ODSs on stratospheric ozone
The abundance of ozone in the stratosphere at a particular lo-
cation is governed by three processes: photochemical produc-
tion, destruction by catalytic cycles, and transport processes. 
Photochemical production in the stratosphere occurs mostly 
through the photolysis of O2, with loss via catalytic cycles involv-
ing hydrogen (HOx), nitrogen (NOx), and halogen (ClOx, BrOx) 
radicals (see Box 1.1). The relative importance of the various 
loss cycles in the stratosphere varies substantially with altitude 
(Figure 1.11). Above about 45 km, loss through HOx dominates, 
while below this altitude NOx-catalyzed ozone loss is most im-
portant. The importance of the ClOx-catalyzed ozone loss cycle, 
which varies with chlorine loading, peaks at about 40 km. Below 
about 25 km HOx-driven ozone loss cycles dominate again.
1.3.1.1 
Upper stratosphere
In the upper stratosphere the ozone budget is largely under-
stood, although uncertainties remain regarding the rate con-
stants of key radical reactions. In particular, strong evidence 
has been accumulated that the observed ozone depletion in the 
upper stratosphere is caused by increased levels of stratospher-
ic chlorine (WMO, 1999, Chapter 6; WMO, 2003, Chapter 
4), as originally proposed by Molina and Rowland (1974) and 
Crutzen (1974). Because of the direct correspondence between 
the stratospheric chlorine abundance and ozone depletion in the 
upper stratosphere, it has been suggested (e.g., WMO, 1999, 
Chapter 12) that the response of stratospheric ozone to the de-
clining stratospheric chlorine levels might be ﬁrst detectable in 
the upper stratosphere (see also Box 1.7 in Section 1.4.2). 
1.3.1.2 
Polar regions 
In recent decades stratospheric ozone losses have been most 
pronounced in polar regions during winter and spring (WMO 
2003, Chapter 3; see also Figures 1.5 and 1.6). These losses 
are determined largely by three chemical factors: (1) the con-
version of chlorine reservoirs into active, ozone-destroying 
forms through heterogeneous reactions on the surfaces of polar 
stratospheric cloud particles; (2) the availability of sunlight that 
drives the catalytic photochemical cycles that destroy ozone; 
and (3) the timing of the deactivation of chlorine (i.e., the tim-
ing of the conversion of active chlorine back to the reservoir 
species). Temperature controls the formation and destruction of 
polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) and thus the timing of activa-
tion (1) and deactivation (3) of chlorine. Furthermore, tempera-
ture controls the efﬁciency of the catalytic cycles (especially 
the ClO dimer cycle; see Box 1.1) that destroy ozone in the 
presence of sunlight (2). 
 
However, polar ozone loss would not occur without a prom-
inent dynamical feature of the stratosphere in winter and spring: 
the polar vortex. In both hemispheres, the polar vortex sepa-
rates polar air from mid-latitude air to a large extent, and within 
the vortex the low-temperature conditions that develop are the 
key factor for polar ozone loss. These two factors are dynami-
cally related: a strong vortex is generally also a colder vortex. 
The two crucial questions for future polar ozone are whether, 
in an increased greenhouse-gas climate, the region of low strat-
ospheric temperatures will increase in area and whether it will 
persist for longer in any given year (see Section 1.3.2).
 
When anthropogenically emitted ODSs are eventually re-
moved from the stratosphere, the stratospheric halogen burden 
will be much lower than it is today and will be controlled by 
the naturally occurring source gases methyl chloride (CH3Cl) 
and methyl bromide (CH3Br). Under such conditions, dramat-
ic losses of polar ozone in winter and spring as we see today 
are not expected to occur. However, the rate of removal of an-
thropogenic halogens from the atmosphere depends on the at-
mospheric lifetimes of CFCs (typically 50–100 years) and is 
considerably slower than the rate at which halogens have been 
increasing in the decades prior to approximately the year 2000, 
when the stratospheric halogen loading peaked (Figure 1.7). A

complete removal of anthropogenic halogens from the atmos-
phere will take more than a century. During this period of en-
hanced levels of halogens caused by past anthropogenic emis-
sions, the polar stratosphere will remain vulnerable to climate 
perturbations, such as increasing water vapour or a cooling of 
the stratosphere, that lead to enhanced ozone destruction.
1.3.1.3 
Lower-stratospheric mid-latitudes 
It is well established that ozone in the lower stratosphere at mid-
latitudes has been decreasing for a few decades; both measure-
ments of ozone locally in the lower stratosphere and measure-
ments of column ozone (a quantity that is dominated by the 
amount of ozone in the lower stratosphere) show a clear decline 
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). However, because mid-latitude ozone 
loss is much less severe than polar ozone loss, it cannot be iden-
tiﬁed in measurements in any one year but is rather detected as 
a downward trend in statistical analyses of longer time-series. It 
is clear that chemical loss driven by halogens is very important, 
but other possible effects that may contribute to the observed 
mid-latitude trends have also been identiﬁed. A deﬁnitive quan-
titative attribution of the trends to particular mechanisms has 
not yet been achieved. Chapter 4 of WMO (2003) reviewed this 
issue most recently; we will not repeat that detailed analysis 
here but instead provide a brief summary. 
 
The chemical processes that may affect trends of mid-lati-
tude ozone are essentially related to the ODS trends that are 
known to be responsible for the observed ozone loss in the 
upper stratosphere and in the polar regions. (Transport effects 
are discussed in Section 1.3.4.) Halogen chemistry may lead to 
ozone depletion in the mid-latitude lower stratosphere through 
a number of possible mechanisms, including:
1. Export of air that has encountered ozone destruction during 
the winter from the polar vortex (e.g., Prather et al., 1990).
2. Export of air with enhanced levels of active chlorine from 
the polar vortex (e.g., Prather and Jaffe, 1990; Norton and 
Chipperﬁeld, 1995).
3. In situ activation of chlorine either on cold liquid sulfate 
aerosol particles (e.g., Keim et al., 1996) or on ice particles 
(e.g., Borrmann et al., 1997; Bregman et al., 2002). Further, 
the reaction of N2O5 with water on liquid aerosol particles at 
higher temperatures indirectly enhances the concentrations 
of ClO at mid-latitudes (McElroy et al., 1992).
4. Ozone depletion due to elevated levels of BrO in the lower 
stratosphere, possibly caused by transport of very short-
lived halogen-containing compounds or BrO across the tro-
popause (WMO, 2003, Chapter 2).
The ﬁrst mechanism results from transport combined with po-
lar ozone loss, whereas the remaining three mechanisms all 
involve in situ chemical destruction of ozone at mid-latitudes. 
All four mechanisms listed above are ultimately driven by the 
increase of halogens in the atmosphere over the past decades. 
Thus, while Millard et al. (2002) emphasized the strong inter-
annual variability in the relative contributions of the different 
mechanisms to the seasonal mid-latitude ozone loss during the 
winter-spring period, they nonetheless showed that ozone loss 
driven by catalytic cycles involving halogens was always an 
important contributor (40–70%) to the simulated mid-latitude 
ozone loss in the ﬁve winters in the 1990s that they studied. 
Similarly, Chipperﬁeld (2003) found that the observed mid-
latitude column ozone decrease from 1980 to the early 1990s 
could be reproduced in long-term simulations in a 3-D chem-
istry-transport model (CTM). The modelled ozone is affected 
by dynamical interannual variability, but the overall decreases 
are dominated by halogen trends; and about 30–50% of the 
modelled halogen-induced change is a result of high latitude 
processing on PSCs.
 
Under climate change the strength of the polar vortex may 
change (see Section 1.3.2), but the sign of this change is un-
certain. A change in the strength and temperature of the vortex 
will affect chlorine activation and ozone loss there and, through 
mechanisms (1) and (2), ozone loss in mid-latitudes. 
 
The possibility that chlorine might be activated on cirrus 
clouds or on cold liquid aerosol particles in the lowermost strat-
osphere (mechanism (3)) was revisited recently by Bregman et 
al. (2002). Based on their model results it seems unlikely that 
this process is the main mechanism for the observed long-term 
decline of ozone in the mid-latitude lower stratosphere. 
 
Very short-lived organic chlorine-, bromine-, and iodine-con-
taining compounds possess a potential to deplete stratospheric 
ozone. However a quantitative assessment of their impact on 
stratospheric ozone is made difﬁcult by their short lifetime, so 
there is need to consider the transport pathways from the tropo-
sphere to the stratosphere of these compounds in detail (WMO, 
2003, Chapter 2). An upper limit for total stratospheric iodine, 
Iy, of 0.10 ± 0.02 ppt was recently reported (for below 20 km) 
by Bösch et al. (2003). The impact of this magnitude of iodine 
loading on stratospheric ozone is negligible.
 
The disturbance of the mid-latitude ozone budget caused by 
anthropogenic emissions of ODSs will ultimately cease when 
the stratospheric halogen burden has reached low enough levels 
(see Section 1.2.2 and Box 1.7 in Section 1.4.2). However, like 
polar ozone, mid-latitude ozone will for many decades remain 
vulnerable to an enhancement of halogen-catalyzed ozone loss 
caused by climate change and by natural phenomena such as 
volcanic eruptions.
1.3.2 
Impact of temperature changes on ozone chemistry
The increasing abundance of WMGHGs in the atmosphere is ex-
pected to lead to an increase in temperature in the troposphere. 
Furthermore, increasing concentrations of most of these gases, 
notably CO2, N2O and CH4, are expected to lead to a tempera-
ture decrease in the stratosphere. By far the strongest contribu-
tion to stratospheric cooling from the WMGHGs comes from 
CO2 (Section 1.2.4). As noted in Section 1.2.4, temperatures in 
the stratosphere are also believed to have decreased in part be-
cause of the observed reductions in ozone concentrations; any 
such cooling would have a feedback on the ozone changes.
 
Decreasing stratospheric temperatures lead to a reduction of

Chapter 1: Ozone and Climate: A Review of Interconnections
103
the ozone loss rate in the upper stratosphere, thereby indirectly 
leading to more ozone in this region. This reduction of ozone 
loss is caused by the very strong positive temperature depend-
ence of the ozone loss rate, mainly owing to the Chapman reac-
tions and the NOx cycle (Figure 1.12). This inverse relationship 
between ozone and temperature changes in the upper strato-
sphere has been known for many years (Barnett et al., 1975). 
More recently, differences in temperature between the two 
hemispheres have been identiﬁed (Li et al., 2002) as a cause 
of inter-hemispheric differences in both the seasonal cycle of 
upper-stratospheric ozone abundances and in the upper-stra-
tospheric ozone trend deduced from satellite measurements.
 
In the mid-latitude lower stratosphere, one mechanism that 
leads to ozone loss and is directly sensitive to temperature 
changes involves heterogeneous reactions on the surfaces of 
cloud and cold aerosol particles (see mechanism (3) in Section 
1.3.1.3). The rates of many of these reactions increase strongly 
with decreasing temperature. Similarly, the reaction rates in-
crease with increasing water-vapour concentrations, so that 
future increases in water, should they occur, would also have 
an impact (see Sections 1.2.3 and 1.3.3). Note, however, that 
in the lower-stratospheric mid-latitudes the most important het-
erogeneous reactions are hydrolysis of N2O5 and bromine ni-
trate, which are relatively insensitive to temperature and water 
vapour concentrations. Therefore, the expected impact of cli-
mate change on the chemical mechanism (3) is expected to be 
relatively small. In addition to this impact on heterogeneous 
chemistry, Zeng and Pyle (2003) have argued that a reduction 
in temperature in the lower stratosphere can slow the rate of 
HOx-driven ozone destruction.
 
Polar ozone loss occurs when temperatures in a large enough 
region sink below the threshold temperature for the existence of 
PSCs (approximately 195 K), because chlorine is activated by 
heterogeneous reactions on the surfaces of PSCs. Therefore, a 
cooling of the stratosphere enhances Arctic ozone loss if the 
volume of polar air with temperatures below the PSC threshold 
value increases. (The Antarctic in winter and spring is already 
consistently below this threshold.) Moreover, a stronger PSC 
activity is expected to lead to a greater denitriﬁcation of the 
Arctic vortex, hence a slower deactivation of chlorine and, con-
sequently, a greater chemical ozone loss (Waibel et al., 1999; 
Tabazadeh et al., 2000). Rex et al. (2004) have deduced an em-
pirical relation between observed temperatures and observed 
winter-spring chemical loss of Arctic ozone (Figure 1.13). 
Based on this relation, and for current levels of chlorine, about 
15 DU additional loss of total ozone is expected for each 1 K 
cooling of the Arctic lower stratosphere. 
 
Although the lower stratosphere is expected to generally 
cool with increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations (Section 
1.2.4), the temperature changes in the lower stratosphere dur-

Figure 1.12. An estimate of the contribution of the various ozone loss cycles to the ozone loss rate, together with the ozone production rate P(O3), 
at 45°N for equinox conditions (end of March) as a function of temperature (bottom panels). The estimates were obtained from short (20-day) runs 
of a chemical box model, starting from climatological values of ozone; the ozone mixing ratios at the end of the run are shown in the top panels. 
Panels (a) show conditions for 40 km altitude (2.5 hPa), where the climatological temperature is about 250 K; panels (b) show conditions for 20 
km (55 hPa), where the climatological temperature is about 215 K. Reaction rate constants were taken from Sander et al. (2003). The production 
and loss rates are for the simulated ozone value. Note that at 40 km ozone is in steady-state (i.e., production equals the sum of all loss terms) and 
thus ozone is under photochemical control. At 20 km ozone production does not equal loss, implying that transport also has a strong inﬂuence on 
ozone concentrations. At 20 km the simulated ozone value after 20 days remains close to its initial climatological value of 1.70 ppm.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
ing the polar wintertime will be sensitive to any change in cir-
culation associated with dynamical feedbacks, principally from 
changes in planetary wave drag (see Section 1.3.4.1). In princi-
ple, these feedbacks could be of either sign and thus could lead 
to enhanced cooling or even to warming. An early model study 
found enhanced cooling, to the extent that polar ozone loss 
would be expected to increase during the next 10 to 15 years 
even while halogen levels decreased (Shindell et al., 1998). 
More recent studies with higher-resolution models have found 
a much less dramatic dynamical feedback, with some models 
showing an increase and some a decrease in planetary wave 
drag, and with all models predicting a relatively small change 
in Arctic ozone over the next few decades (Austin et al., 2003). 
However, it should be noted that model results for the Arctic are 
difﬁcult to assess because the processes leading to polar ozone 
depletion show so much natural variability that the atmosphere 
may evolve anywhere within (or even outside) the envelope 
provided by an ensemble of model simulations (see Section 3.5 
of WMO, 2003).
 
In any event, it is the Arctic that is most sensitive to the 
effects caused by climate change that are discussed above. 
Present-day temperatures in the Arctic lie close to the thresh-
old value for the onset of heterogeneous chlorine activation and 
thus close to the threshold value for the onset of rapid ozone 
loss chemistry; in the Antarctic temperatures are much lower 
and thus ozone loss is not as sensitive to temperature changes.
1.3.3 
Impact of methane and water vapour changes on 
ozone chemistry
With the exception of the high latitudes in winter, ozone in the 
upper stratosphere is in a photochemical steady-state; photo-
chemical reactions are sufﬁciently fast that ozone concentra-
tions are determined by a local balance between photochemical 
production and loss. Nonetheless, transport has a signiﬁcant 
indirect inﬂuence on upper stratospheric ozone insofar as it de-
termines the concentrations of trace compounds such as CH4, 
H2O, CFCs and N2O, all of which act as precursors of the radi-
cals that determine the ozone chemistry. Furthermore, CH4 is of 
particular importance because it is the primary mechanism for 
the conversion of reactive Cl to the unreactive HCl reservoir 
via the reaction CH4 + Cl → HCl + CH3, and thus affects the 
efﬁciency of the chlorine-driven ozone loss.
 
Changes in upper stratospheric CH4 (Section 1.2.3) have 
important implications for upper stratospheric ozone. Siskind 
et al. (1998) found that for the period 1992–1995, the increase 
in active chlorine (Cl and ClO) resulting from the CH4 decrease 
was the largest contributor to the ozone changes occurring over 
that time. Indeed, a measured increase in upper-stratospheric 
ClO between 1991 and 1997, which is signiﬁcantly greater than 
that expected from the increase in the chlorine source gases 
alone, may be explained by the observed concurrent decrease 
of CH4 (Froidevaux et al., 2000). Further, Li et al. (2002) ﬁnd 
that inter-hemispheric differences in CH4 are partly responsible 
(together with inter-hemispheric differences in temperature) 
for observed differences in upper stratospheric ozone trends 
between the two hemispheres (from the SAGE I and SAGE II 
satellite experiments for 1979–1997).
 
Stratospheric water vapour is the primary source of the HOx 
radicals that drive the dominant ozone loss cycles in the upper 
stratosphere (Figure 1.11). An increase in stratospheric water 
vapour is therefore expected to lead to a greater chemical loss 
of ozone in the upper stratosphere (e.g., Siskind et al., 1998). 
This effect has been investigated quantitatively in model simu-
lations. In a study of conditions for the year 2010, Jucks and 
Salawitch (2000) ﬁnd that above 45 km an increase of 1% in 
the water vapour mixing ratio would completely negate the in-
crease of ozone driven by the 15% decrease of inorganic chlo-
rine that is expected by the year 2010. At 40 km the increase 
of ozone would still be reduced by about 50%. Shindell (2001) 
conducted a general circulation model (GCM) study for the pe-
riod 1979–1996. The simulations show a signiﬁcant chemical 
effect of water vapour increases on ozone concentrations, with 
a reduction of more than 1% between 45 and 55 km, and a max-
imum impact of about 4% at 50 km. Further, Li et al. (2002) 
found that the annually averaged (downward) ozone trend at 
45°S and 1.8 hPa (45 km) increases by 1% per decade for a 
water vapour increase of 1% yr–1. These model results point to 
an anticorrelation between ozone and water vapour in the upper 
stratosphere and lower mesosphere. However, such an anticor-
relation is not seen in observations and ozone in this region var-
ies much less than predicted by models (Siskind et al., 2002).
 
In the mid-latitude lower stratosphere, any increase in water 
vapour would also be expected to lead to ozone loss because of 
an intensiﬁed HOx ozone loss cycle (see Box 1.1). The model 
results of Dvortsov and Solomon (2001) predict that an increase 
in stratospheric water vapour of 1% yr–1 translates to an ad-

ditional depletion of mid-latitude column ozone by 0.3% per 
decade.
 
In the polar lower stratosphere, the rates of the heterogene-
ous reactions that are responsible for the activation of chlorine 
(which eventually leads to chemical ozone destruction) increase 
with increasing water vapour concentrations. An increase in 
stratospheric water vapour essentially means that the temper-
ature threshold at which PSCs form, and thus heterogeneous 
reactions rates begin to become signiﬁcant for chlorine activa-
tion, is shifted to higher values. If stratospheric water vapour 
were to increase it could lead to a substantially enhanced Arctic 
ozone loss in the future (e.g., Kirk-Davidoff et al., 1999).
 
In considering the above discussion concerning stratospheric 
water vapour, it needs to be borne in mind that there is consider-
able uncertainty about the sign of future water vapour changes 
in light of the puzzling past record (Section 1.2.3). 
1.3.4 
The role of transport for ozone changes
Transport is a key factor inﬂuencing the seasonal and inter- 
annual variability of stratospheric ozone. Seasonal variations in 
transport force the large winter-spring build-up of extra-tropi-
cal total ozone in both hemispheres, and inter-hemispheric dif-
ferences in transport (larger in the NH) cause corresponding 
differences in extra-tropical total ozone (see Box 1.2). In both 
hemispheres, mid-latitude ozone decreases during summer and 
returns to approximate photochemical balance by autumn, and 
there is a strong persistence of the dynamically forced anoma-
lies throughout summer (Fioletov and Shepherd, 2003; Weber 
et al., 2003). The interannual variability in the winter-spring 
build-up is greater in the NH, reﬂecting the greater dynamical 
variability of the NH stratosphere. 
1.3.4.1 
Stratospheric planetary-wave-induced transport 
and mixing
Large-scale transport of ozone is a result of advection by the 
Brewer-Dobson circulation and of eddy transport effects; both 
of these mechanisms are ﬁrst-order terms in the zonal mean 
ozone transport equation (Andrews et al., 1987). The strength 
of the Brewer-Dobson circulation is directly tied to dissipat-
ing planetary waves forced from the troposphere, and eddy 
transports of ozone are also linked to planetary wave activity 
(although this latter linkage is difﬁcult to quantify), so that net 
ozone transport is tied to the variability of forced planetary 
waves. The amount of dissipating wave activity (also called 
planetary wave drag, PWD) within the stratosphere is related 
to the vertical component of wave activity entering the lower 
stratosphere (the so-called Eliassen-Palm (EP) ﬂux). This quan-
tity can be derived from conventional meteorological analyses 
and is a convenient proxy used to quantify PWD. A signiﬁcant 
correlation has been found between interannual changes in 
PWD and total ozone build-up during winter and spring (Fusco 
and Salby, 1999; Randel et al., 2002). The fact that the effect 
of PWD on ozone is seasonal and has essentially no interan-
nual memory suggests that long-term changes in PWD can be 
expected to lead to long-term changes in winter-spring ozone, 
all else being equal. However, although the basic physics of the 
ozone-PWD connection is well understood, its quantiﬁcation 
via correlations is at best crude, and this limits our ability to 
attribute changes in ozone to changes in PWD.
 
In the NH, there have been interannual variations in vari-
ous meteorological parameters during the period 1980–2000 
that together paint a fairly consistent, albeit incomplete, pic-
ture. During the mid-1990s the NH exhibited a number of years 
when the Arctic wintertime vortex was colder and stronger 
(Graf et al., 1995; Pawson and Naujokat, 1999) and more per-
sistent (Waugh et al., 1999). Any dynamically induced com-
ponent of these changes requires a weakened Brewer-Dobson 
circulation, which in turn requires a decrease in PWD. Such 
a decrease in PWD during this period has been documented 
(Newman and Nash, 2000), although the results were sensitive 
to which months and time periods were considered. Randel et 
al. (2002) show that for the period 1979–2000, PWD in the NH 
increased during early winter (November to December) and de-
creased during mid-winter (January to February). This seasonal 
variation is consistent with the Arctic early winter warming 
and late winter cooling seen over the same time period at 100 
hPa (Langematz et al., 2003; see also Figure 1.16 in Section 
1.4.1.2). The weakened Brewer-Dobson circulation during mid-
winter implies a decrease in the winter build-up of mid-latitude 
ozone, and Randel et al. (2002) estimated that the decreased 
wave driving may account for about 20–30% of the observed 
changes in ozone in the January to March period. Changes in 
SH dynamics are not as clear as in the NH, primarily because 
meteorological reanalysis data sets are less well constrained by 
observations. 
 
Planetary waves, in addition to affecting the temperature 
and chemistry of the polar stratosphere through the processes 
described earlier, can also displace the centre of the polar vor-
tex off the pole. This has important implications for ozone and 
NOx chemistry because air parcel trajectories within the vortex 
are then no longer conﬁned to the polar night but experience 
short periods of sunlight (Solomon et al., 1993). Polar ozone 
loss processes are usually limited by the poleward retreat of the 
terminator (the boundary that delineates polar night). Planetary 
wave distortion of the vortex can expose deeper vortex air to 
sunlight (Lee et al., 2000) and cause ozone depletion chemistry 
to start earlier than it would have otherwise. In this way, wave-
induced displacements of the vortex can drive a mid-winter 
start to Antarctic ozone depletion (Roscoe et al., 1997; Bodeker 
et al., 2001).
 
Because wave-induced forcing in the stratosphere is be-
lieved to come primarily from planetary-scale Rossby waves 
that are generated in the troposphere during wintertime, future 
changes in the generation of tropospheric waves may inﬂuence 
polar ozone abundance. However there is as yet no consensus 
from models on the sign of this change (Austin et al., 2003).

Tropopause variations and ozone mini-holes

affect the mid-latitude distribution of column ozone. The rela-
tionship between local mid-latitude tropopause height and col-
umn ozone on day-to-day time scales is well documented (e.g., 
Dobson, 1963; Bojkov et al., 1993). Day-to-day changes in tro-
popause height are associated with the passage of synoptic-scale 
disturbances in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, 
which affect ozone in the lower stratosphere through trans-
port (Salby and Callaghan, 1993) and can result in large local 
changes in column ozone, particularly in the vicinity of storm 
tracks (James, 1998). In extreme situations, they can lead to so-
called ozone mini-holes, which occur over both hemispheres 
and have the lowest column ozone levels observed outside the 
polar vortices, sometimes well under 220 DU (Allaart et al., 
2000; Hood et al., 2001; Teitelbaum et al., 2001; Canziani et 
al., 2002). Ozone mini-holes do not primarily entail a destruc-
tion of ozone, but rather its re-distribution. Changes in the spa-
tial and temporal occurrence of synoptic-scale processes and 
Rossby wave breaking (e.g., storm track displacements) that are 
induced by climate change or natural variability, could lead to 
changes in the distribution or frequency of the occurrence of 
mini-hole and low-ozone events, and thus to regional changes 
in the mean column ozone (Hood et al., 1999; Reid et al., 2000; 
Orsolini and Limpasuvan, 2001). 
 
Observations have shown that over the NH the altitude of 
the extra-tropical tropopause has generally increased over re-
cent decades. Radiosonde measurements over both Europe and 
Canada show an increase in altitude of about 300–600 m over 
the past 30 years, with the precise amount depending on lo-
cation (Forster and Tourpali, 2001; Steinbrecht et al., 2001). 
Consistent regional increases are also seen in meteorological 
reanalyses over both hemispheres (Hoinka, 1999; Thompson et 
al., 2000), although reanalysis trend studies should be viewed 
with care (Bengtsson et al., 2004). Spatial patterns show in-
creases over the NH and SH beginning at mid-latitudes and 
reaching a maximum towards the poles. The magnitude of the 
changes can also depend on the longitude. 
 
However, the effects of tropospheric circulation changes 
on ozone and the relation of both to tropopause height changes 
remain poorly understood at present. In particular, the relation-
ship between tropopause height and ozone mentioned earlier 
applies to single stations; there is no reason to expect it to apply 
in the zonal mean, or on longer time scales (e.g., seasonal or 
interannual) over which ozone transport is irreversible. Because 
of our poor understanding of what controls the zonal-mean mid-
latitude tropopause height, or whether it is possible to consider 
such processes in a zonal-mean approach, it is not clear that 
the ozone-tropopause height correlations (derived from daily 
or monthly statistics) can be extended to decadal time scales in 
order to estimate changes in ozone. Some recent model stud-
ies suggest that lower stratospheric cooling caused by ozone 
depletion, acting together with tropospheric warming due to 
WMGHGs, can be a contributor to tropopause height changes 
(Santer et al., 2003a,b), in which case the tropopause height 
changes cannot be entirely considered as a cause of the ozone 
changes. One source of uncertainty in these model calculations 
is that most climate models cannot resolve the observed tropo-
pause height changes, so these must be inferred by interpola-
tion; another is that the observed ozone changes are not well 
quantiﬁed close to the tropopause (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). 
Furthermore there remain considerable differences between the 
various reanalysis products available, as well as between the 
model results.
1.3.4.3 
Stratosphere-troposphere exchange
Stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) processes also affect 
the ozone distribution and have the capability to affect tropo-
spheric chemistry. STE is a two-way process that encompasses 
transport from the troposphere into the stratosphere (TST) and 
from the stratosphere into the troposphere (STT) through a vari-
ety of processes (see Holton et al., 1995, and references therein). 
Some aspects of STE are implicit in the preceding discussions. 
The net mass ﬂux from the troposphere into the stratosphere and 
back again is driven by PWD through the Brewer-Dobson circu-
lation (Section 1.1.2; Holton et al., 1995). Although the global 
approach can explain the net global ﬂux, local and regional pro-
cesses need to be identiﬁed and assessed to fully understand the 
distribution of trace species being exchanged. Such understand-
ing is relevant both for chemical budgets and for climate change 
and variability studies. Although there is a net TST in the trop-
ics and a net STT in the extratropics, a number of mechanisms 
that lead to STT in the tropics and TST in the extratropics have 
been identiﬁed (e.g., Appenzeller and Davies, 1992; Poulida et 
al., 1996; Hintsa et al., 1998; Ray et al., 1999; Lelieveld and 
Dentener, 2000; Stohl et al., 2003). In the extratropics TST can 
signiﬁcantly affect the composition of the lowermost stratosphere, 
even if the exchange cannot reach higher into the stratosphere, 
by introducing, during deep TST events, near-surface pollutants, 
and ozone-poor and humid air. Similarly, deep STT events can 
transport ozone-rich air into the mid- and lower troposphere. It 
should be noted, however, that so-called shallow events, with ex-
changes near the tropopause, remain the main feature in the ex-
tratropics. Regions of occurrence of such exchange processes, at 
least in the NH (Sprenger and Wernli, 2003), appear to be linked 
to the storm tracks and their variability, that is, in the same region 
where mini-holes are most frequent. 
 
The past and future variability of STE remains to be assessed. 
It is clear that changes in planetary wave activity will modify 
the Brewer-Dobson circulation and hence affect global trans-
port processes (Rind et al., 1990; Butchart and Scaife, 2001). As 
for regional mechanisms, seasonal and interannual variability, 
driven, for example, by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) 
and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), have already 
been observed (James et al., 2003; Sprenger and Wernli, 2003). 
Changes in the occurrence of regional and local weather phe-
nomena could also modify STE. Fifteen-year studies with re-
analysis products have not yielded any distinct trends (Sprenger 
and Wernli, 2003). Given the discrepancies between different 
approaches to evaluate STE and inhomogeneities in meteoro-
logical analyses and reanalyses, consistent trend studies are not 
available as of yet.

1.3.4.4 
The tropical tropopause layer
Air enters the stratosphere primarily in the tropics, and hence 
the physical and chemical characteristics of air near the tropi-
cal tropopause behave as boundary conditions for the global 
stratosphere. The tropical tropopause is relatively high, near 17 
km. The tropospheric lapse rate (up to 12–14 km) is determined 
by radiative-convective equilibrium, whereas the thermal struc-
ture above 14 km is primarily in radiative balance, which is 
characteristic of the stratosphere (Thuburn and Craig, 2002). 
Overall, the region of the tropical atmosphere between about 
12 km and the tropopause has characteristics intermediate to 
those of the troposphere and stratosphere, and is referred to as 
the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) (Highwood and Hoskins, 
1998). Thin (sometimes subvisible) cirrus clouds are observed 
over large areas of the TTL (Wang et al., 1996; Winker and 
Trepte, 1998), although their formation mechanism(s) and ef-
fects on large-scale circulation are poorly known. In the tropics, 
the background clear-sky radiative balance shifts from cooling 
in the troposphere to heating in the stratosphere, with the transi-
tion occurring at around 15 km. The region of heating above 
about 15 km is linked to mean upward motion into the lower 
stratosphere, and this region marks the base of the stratospheric 
Brewer-Dobson circulation.
 
The TTL is coupled to stratospheric ozone through its con-
trol of stratospheric water vapour and by the transport of tropo-
spheric source gases and ODSs into the lower stratosphere, so 
changes in the TTL could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. If 
the residence time of air in the TTL before it is transported into 
the stratosphere is short, then it may be possible that short-lived 
halogen compounds (natural or anthropogenic replacements for 
the CFCs) or their degradation products could enter the lower 
stratosphere and contribute to ozone loss there (WMO, 2003, 
Chapter 2). 
 
Air entering the stratosphere is dehydrated as it passes 
through the cold tropical tropopause, and this drying accounts 
for the extreme aridity of the global stratosphere (Brewer, 
1949). Furthermore, the seasonal cycle in tropopause tempera-
ture imparts a strong seasonal variation in stratospheric water 
vapour, which then propagates with the mean stratospheric 
transport circulation (Mote et al., 1996). Year-to-year variations 
in tropical tropopause temperatures are also highly correlated 
with global stratospheric water vapour anomalies (Randel et 
al., 2004), although there remain some issues concerning the 
consistency of decadal-scale changes in water vapour (Section 
1.2.3). However, while there is strong empirical coupling be-
tween tropopause temperatures and stratospheric water vapour, 
details of the dehydration mechanism(s) within the TTL are 
still a topic of scientiﬁc debate (Holton and Gettelman, 2001; 
Sherwood and Dessler, 2001). One critical, unanswered ques-
tion is whether, and how, the TTL will change in response to 
climate change and what will be the resulting impact on strato-
spheric ozone.
1.3.5 
Stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling
Analysis of observational data shows that atmospheric circula-
tion tends to maintain spatially coherent, large-scale patterns 
for extended periods of time, and then to shift to similar patterns 
of opposite phase. These patterns represent preferred modes of 
variability of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-sea-ice sys-
tem. They ﬂuctuate on intra-seasonal, seasonal, interannual 
and decadal time scales, and are inﬂuenced by externally and 
anthropogenically caused climate variability. Some of the pat-
terns exhibit seesaw-like behaviour and are usually called oscil-
lations. A few circulation modes, listed below, have been impli-
cated in stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling, and thus 
may provide a coupling between stratospheric ozone depletion 
and tropospheric climate. 
• Northern Annular Mode (NAM) (Thompson and Wallace, 
1998, 2000; Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999): The NAM, also 
referred to as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), is a hemisphere-
wide annular atmospheric circulation pattern in which at-
mospheric pressure over the northern polar region varies out 
of phase with pressure over northern mid-latitudes (around 
45°N), on time scales ranging from weeks to decades.
• Southern Annular Mode (SAM) (Gong and Wang, 1999; 
Thompson and Wallace, 2000): The SAM, also referred to 
as the Antarctic Oscillation, is the SH analogue of the NAM. 
The SAM exhibits a large-scale alternation of pressure and 
temperature between the mid-latitudes and the polar re-
gion.
• North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (Walker and Bliss, 1932; 
Hurrell, 1995): The NAO was originally identiﬁed as a see-
saw of sea-level pressure between the Icelandic Low and the 
Azores High, but an associated circulation (and pressure) 
pattern is also exhibited well above in the troposphere. The 
NAO is the dominant regional pattern of wintertime atmo-
spheric circulation variability over the extra-tropical North 
Atlantic, and has exhibited variability and trends over long 
time periods (Appenzeller et al., 2000). The relationship be-
tween the NAO and the NAM remains a matter of debate 
(Wallace, 2000; Ambaum et al., 2001; Rogers and McHugh, 
2002).
The NAM extends through the depth of the troposphere. During 
the cold season (January to March), when the stratosphere has 
large-amplitude disturbances, the NAM also has a strong sig-
nature in the stratosphere, where it is associated with variations 
in the strength of the westerly vortex that encircles the Arctic 
polar stratosphere; this signature suggests a coupling between 
the stratosphere and the troposphere (Perlwitz and Graf, 1995; 
Thompson and Wallace, 1998; Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999). 
During winters when the stratospheric vortex is stronger than 
normal, the NAM (and NAO) tends to be in a positive phase.
 
Circulation modes can affect the ozone distribution di-
rectly (in the troposphere and the lowermost stratosphere; 
see Lamarque and Hess, 2004), and indirectly by inﬂuencing 
propagation of planetary waves from the troposphere into the 
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   107

middle atmosphere (Ambaum and Hoskins, 2002). Therefore, 
changes in circulation modes can produce changes in ozone dis-
tribution. It has been shown that because the NAO has a large 
vertical extent during the winter and because it modulates the 
tropopause height, it can explain much of the spatial pattern 
in column ozone trends in the North Atlantic over the past 30 
years (Appenzeller et al., 2000). 
 
Stratospheric changes may feed back onto changes in circu-
lation modes. Observations suggest that at least in some cases 
the large amplitude NAM anomalies tend to propagate from the 
stratosphere to the troposphere on time scales of weeks to a few 
months (Baldwin and Dunkerton, 1999; Christiansen, 2001). 
Furthermore, because of the strong coupling between the strat-
ospheric vortex and the NAM, the recent trend in the NAM 
and NAO has been associated with processes that are known 
to affect the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex, such as 
tropical volcanic eruptions (Kodera, 1994; Kelly et al., 1996; 
Rozanov et al., 2002; Stenchikov et al., 2002), ozone deple-
tion (Graf et al., 1998; Shindell et al., 2001a), and anthropo-
genic changes in greenhouse gas concentrations (Shindell et al., 
2001a; Gillett et al., 2002a). However, some modelling studies 
have shown that a simulated trend in the tropospheric NAM and 
SAM does not necessarily depend on stratospheric involvement 
(Fyfe et al., 1999; Gillett et al., 2002b). Global climate model-
ling simulations that include interactive stratospheric chemis-
try suggest that one mechanism by which solar variability may 
affect tropospheric climate is through solar-forced changes in 
upper-stratospheric ozone that induce changes in the leading 
mode of variability of the coupled troposphere-stratosphere cir-
culation (Shindell et al., 2001b).
 
A number of modelling studies have examined the effect 
of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases on the annular 
modes (e.g., Perlwitz et al., 2000; Shindell et al., 2001a; Gillett 
et al., 2002b; Rauthe et al., 2004). Most coupled atmosphere-
ocean climate models agree in ﬁnding a positive NAM trend 
under increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations, a trend which 
is qualitatively consistent with the observed positive NAM trend. 
A more positive NAM is consistent with a stronger stratospheric 
vortex. On the other hand, an intensiﬁed polar vortex is related 
to changes in planetary- and synoptic-scale wave characteristics, 
and may produce tropospheric circulation anomalies similar to 
the positive phase of the NAM. These potential feedbacks ob-
scure cause and effect. For example, whereas Rind et al. (2002) 
and Sigmond et al. (2004) found that in the middle stratosphere 
the perturbation to the NAM from a 2 × CO2 climate depends on 
modelled changes in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), Sigmond 
et al. (2004) suggested that perturbations in the zonal wind near 
the surface (which will affect the response to SSTs) are mainly 
caused by doubling of stratospheric CO2.
 
The stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling through 
the circulation modes discussed in this section suggests that 
stratospheric dynamics should be accounted for in the prob-
lem of detection and prediction of future tropospheric climate 
change. Because increased concentrations of greenhouse gases 
may cause changes in stratospheric dynamics (and in ozone, 
which in turn cause changes in stratospheric dynamics), green-
house-gas changes may induce changes in surface climate 
through stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling, in addi-
tion to radiative forcing.
1.3.6 
Possible dynamical feedbacks of ozone changes
The effect of ozone loss on polar stratospheric temperatures re-
sults in concomitant changes in stratospheric zonal winds and 
polar vortex structure, and also possible changes in planetary-
wave behaviour. The strongest effect is seen in the Antarctic, 
where a large cooling of the lower stratosphere, which is associ-
ated with the ozone hole (Randel and Wu, 1999), has resulted 
in an intensiﬁed and more persistent springtime polar vortex. 
Waugh et al. (1999) show that since the ozone hole developed, 
the break-up date of the Antarctic vortex occurs two to three 
weeks later (moving from mid-November to early December) 
than before. Recent research has shown that trends in surface 
temperatures over Antarctica (cooling over the interior and part 
of the warming over the peninsula) may be in part traceable, at 
least over the period 1980–2000, to trends in the lower strat-
ospheric polar vortex, which are largely caused by the ozone 
hole (Thompson and Solomon, 2002). It has been suggested 
that during the early summer the strengthening of the west-
erly ﬂow extends all the way to the surface (Thompson and 
Solomon, 2002). The role of this mechanism – which has yet to 
be elucidated – has been highlighted by the modelling study of 
Gillett and Thompson (2003), who prescribed ozone depletion 
in an atmospheric climate model. They found that the season-
ality, structure and amplitude of the modelled changes in 500 
hPa geopotential height and near-surface air temperature in the 
Antarctic had similar spatial patterns to observations, which 
were a cooling over the Antarctic interior and a warming over 
the peninsula and South America (Figure 1.14). This result sug-
gests that anthropogenic emissions of ozone-depleting gases 
have had a distinct impact on climate not only in the strato-
sphere but also at the Earth’s surface. These surface changes 
appear to act in the same direction as changes resulting from 
increases in greenhouse gases (Shindell and Schmidt, 2004).
 
An increase in the strength of the Antarctic polar vortex by 
stratospheric ozone depletion does not affect only surface winds 
and temperatures. Using a 15,000-year integration of a coupled 
ocean-atmosphere model, Hall and Visbeck (2002) showed that 
ﬂuctuations of the mid-latitude westerly winds generate ocean 
circulation and sea-ice variations on interannual to centennial 
time scales.
 
Cause and effect are more difﬁcult to separate in the Arctic 
stratosphere than in the Antarctic stratosphere because of high-
er ‘natural’ meteorological variability, relatively smaller ozone 
losses and a less clear separation between transport and chemi-
cal effects on ozone. Furthermore, temperatures need to be suf-
ﬁciently low in any given year to initiate polar ozone chemistry. 
Nonetheless, in several years during the mid-1990s the Arctic 
experienced low ozone, low temperatures in late spring and en-
hanced vortex persistence (Randel and Wu, 1999; Waugh et al.,

1999), which resembled the coupled changes observed in the 
Antarctic. 
 
A crucial issue is the potential feedback between changes 
in stratospheric climate and planetary wave forcing (through 
both modiﬁcation of tropospheric planetary wave sources and 
changes in wave propagation into and within the stratosphere). 
However, this topic is poorly understood at present. Chen and 
Robinson (1992) and Limpasuvan and Hartmann (2000) have 
argued that stronger vertical shear of the zonal wind at high lati-
tudes will reduce the strength of stratospheric PWD, whereas 
Hu and Tung (2002) have argued for precisely the opposite ef-
fect. Many climate model simulations (e.g., Rind et al., 1990; 
Butchart and Scaife, 2001) found enhanced PWD in an atmos-
phere with elevated WMGHG concentrations, which leads to 
a stronger Brewer-Dobson circulation; however models were 
not unanimous on this result (Shindell et al., 2001a). Because 
planetary wave forcing is a primary driver of the stratospheric 
circulation, improved understanding of this coupling will be 
necessary to predict future ozone changes.

Past and future stratospheric ozone changes 
(attribution and prediction)
1.4.1 
Current understanding of past ozone changes
In Section 1.3 a number of processes were described that can 
inﬂuence the distribution of and changes in stratospheric ozone. 
Here we discuss the current understanding of past ozone chang-
es, based in part on numerical models that attempt to include 
these processes. A hierarchy of models of increasing sophistica-
tion is used (see Box 1.5). Some models include relatively few 
processes (e.g., box models, which include only chemical pro- 
cesses, but perhaps in great detail), whereas others attempt to in-
clude many more (e.g., the chemistry-climate models, CCMs). 
The models have their different uses, and strengths, some of 
which are described in the remainder of Section 1.4. 
 
The understanding of polar and mid-latitude ozone decline 
has been assessed most recently in Chapters 3 and 4 of WMO 
(2003). The material here relies heavily on that report, which 
deals with these topics in much greater detail. 
1.4.1.1 
Mid-latitude ozone depletion
In the upper stratosphere the observed ozone depletion over the 
last 25 years is statistically robust in the sense that its value is 
not sensitive to small differences in the choice of the time peri-
od analyzed (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). This behaviour accords 
with the fact that in this region of the atmosphere, ozone is un-
der photochemical control and thus only weakly affected by 
dynamical variability. We therefore expect upper-stratospheric 
ozone abundance to reﬂect long-term changes in temperature 
and in the abundance of species (principally halogens) that re-
act chemically with ozone. 
 
Over the past 25 years there have been large changes in the 
abundance of halogen compounds, and the extent of the ob-
served ozone decrease is consistent with the observed increase 
in anthropogenic chlorine, as originally predicted by Molina and 
Rowland (1974) and Crutzen (1974). In particular, the vertical 
and latitudinal proﬁles of ozone trends in the upper stratosphere 
are reproduced by 2-D photochemistry models. In the upper 
stratosphere the attribution of ozone loss in the last couple of 
decades to anthropogenic halogens is clear-cut. The 2-D mod-
els indicate that changes in halogens make the largest contribu-
tion to the observed loss of about 7% per decade (WMO, 2003, 
Chapter 4). The observed cooling of the upper stratosphere (of 
perhaps 2 K per decade, see Figure 1.10) will have reduced the 
rate of ozone destruction in this region. If we take the observed 
variation of ozone with temperature in the upper stratosphere 
(e.g., Barnett et al., 1975; Froidevaux et al., 1989), then a cool-
ing of 2 K per decade should have led to an increase in ozone 
of about 2% per decade, partially compensating the loss caused 
by halogens. Note, however, that in the upper stratosphere ra-
diative-transfer models suggest roughly equal contributions to 
the cooling from ozone decreases and carbon dioxide increases 
(Figure 1.10); the changes in the ozone-temperature system are 
nonlinear. Changes in CH4 and N2O will have also played a 
small role here. Note also that although 2-D models have been 
widely used in many ozone assessments, they have important 
limitations in terms of, for example, their ability to include the 
full range of feedbacks between chemistry and dynamics, or 
their ability to reproduce the polar vortex (which will then in-
ﬂuence the treatment of mid-latitudes). They are expected to 
be most accurate in the upper stratosphere, where dynamical 
effects on ozone are weakest.
 
However, the changes in upper-stratospheric ozone repre-
sent only a small contribution to the total changes in column 
ozone observed over the last 25 years, except in the tropics 
where there is no statistically signiﬁcant trend in column ozone 
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). Most of the column ozone deple-
tion in the extratropics occurs in the lower stratosphere, where 
the photochemical time scale for ozone becomes long and the 
ozone distribution is sensitive to dynamical variability as well 
as to chemical processes. This complicates the problem of at-
tribution of the observed ozone decline. Strong ozone variabil-
ity and complex coupled interactions between dynamics and 
chemistry, which are not separable in a simple manner, make 
attribution particularly difﬁcult.
 
A number of 2-D models contributed to Chapter 4 of WMO 
(2003), and a schematic showing their simulations of column 
ozone between 60°S and 60°N from 1980 to 2050 is provided 
in the ﬁgure in Box 1.7 (in Section 1.4.2). The symbols in this 
ﬁgure show the observed changes relative to 1980. As there 
are no signiﬁcant trends in tropical ozone, the observed and  
modelled changes are attributable to mid-latitudes. The shaded 
area shows the results of 2-D photochemistry models forced 
by observed changes in halocarbons, other source gases and 
aerosols (and in some cases, temperatures) from 1980 to 2000. 
Overall, the models broadly reproduce the long-term changes 
in mid-latitude column ozone for 1980–2000, within the range 
of uncertainties of the observations and the model range. The 
spread in the model results comes mainly from their large 
spread over the SH mid-latitudes, and is at least partly a result 
of their treatment of the Antarctic ozone hole (which cannot be 
well represented in a 2-D model). In addition, the agreement be-
tween models and observations over 60°S to 60°N hides some 
important disagreements within each hemisphere. In particular, 
models suggest that the chemical signal of ozone loss follow-
ing the major eruption of the Mt. Pinatubo volcano in the early 
1990s should have been symmetric between the hemispheres, 
but observations show a large degree of inter-hemispheric 
asymmetry in mid-latitudes (see the more detailed discussion in 
Section 4.6 of WMO, 2003). 
 
As discussed in Section 1.3.4, changes in atmospheric dy-
namics can also have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on NH mid-lati-
tude column ozone on decadal time scales. Natural variability, 
changes in greenhouse gases and changes in column ozone 
itself are all likely to contribute to these dynamical changes. 
Furthermore, because chemical and dynamical processes are 
coupled, their contributions to ozone changes cannot be con-
sidered in isolation. This coupling is especially complex and 
difﬁcult to understand with regard to dynamical changes in the

tropopause region. There is an observed relationship between 
column ozone and several tropospheric circulation indices, in-
cluding tropopause height (Section 1.3.4.2). Over time scales of 
up to about one month, it is the dynamical changes that cause 
the ozone changes (Randel and Cobb, 1994), whereas on longer 
time scales feedbacks occur and the causality in the relationship 
becomes unclear. Thus, although various tropospheric circula-
tion indices (including tropopause height) have changed over 
the last 20 years in the NH in such a way as to imply a decrease 
in column ozone, this inference is based on an extrapolation of 
short-time-scale correlations to longer time scales, which may 
not be valid (Section 4.6 of WMO, 2003).
 
Above the tropopause, stratospheric PWD drives the sea-
sonal winter-spring ozone build-up in the extratropics, and has 
essentially no interannual memory (Fioletov and Shepherd, 
2003). It follows that the observed decrease in NH PWD in the 
late winter and spring has likely contributed to the observed de-
crease in NH column ozone over the last 20 to 25 years (Fusco 
Box 1.5. Atmospheric models
The chemical composition and the thermal and dynamical structure of the atmosphere are determined by a large number 
of simultaneously operating and interacting processes. Therefore, numerical mathematical models have become indispens-
able tools to study these complex atmospheric interactions. Scientiﬁc progress is achieved in part by understanding the 
discrepancies between atmospheric observations and results from the models. Furthermore, numerical models allow us to 
make predictions about the future development of the atmosphere. Today, a hierarchy of atmospheric models of increas-
ing complexity is employed for the investigation of the Earth’s atmosphere. Models range from simple (with perhaps one 
process or one spatial dimension considered) to the most complex 3-D and interactive models. In the following list, a brief 
summary of the most important types of models is given:
•  Fixed dynamical-heating (FDH) model: Calculation of stratospheric temperature changes and radiative forcing with a 
radiation scheme, assuming that the stratosphere is in an equilibrium state and no dynamical changes occur in the atmo-
sphere.
•  Trajectory (Lagrangian) model: Simulation of air-parcel movement through the atmosphere based on meteorological 
analyses.
•  Box-trajectory model: Simulation of chemical processes within a parcel of air that moves through the atmosphere.
•  Mesoscale (regional) model: Analysis and forecast of medium-scale (a few tens of kilometers) radiative, dynamical and 
chemical structures in the atmosphere; investigation of transport and exchange processes.
•  Contour-advection model: Simulation of highly resolved speciﬁc two-dimensional (2-D) ﬂuid-dynamical processes, 
such as processes at transport barriers in the atmosphere.
•  Mechanistic circulation model: Simpliﬁed 3-D atmospheric circulation model that allows for the investigation of spe-
ciﬁc dynamical processes.
•  Two-dimensional photochemistry model: Zonally averaged representation of the middle atmosphere, with detailed 
chemistry but highly simpliﬁed transport and mixing.
•  General-circulation climate model (GCM): Three-dimensional simulation of large-scale radiative and dynamical pro-
cesses (spatial resolution of a few hundred kilometers) in the atmosphere over years and decades; investigation of the 
climate effects of atmospheric trace gases (greenhouse gases); investigations of the interaction of the atmosphere with 
the biosphere and oceans.
•  Chemistry-transport model (CTM): Three-dimensional (or 2-D latitude-longitude) simulation of chemical processes 
in the atmosphere employing meteorological analyses derived from observations or GCMs; simulation of spatial and 
temporal development and distribution of chemical species.
•  Chemistry-climate model (CCM): Interactively coupled 3-D GCM with chemistry; investigation of the interaction of 
radiative, dynamical, physical and chemical processes of the atmosphere; assessment of future development of chemical 
composition and climate.
Several decades ago, when numerical models of the atmosphere were ﬁrst developed, much less computational power was 
available than today. Early studies with numerical models focused on the simulation of individual radiative, dynamical or 
chemical processes of the atmosphere. These early and rather simple models have evolved today into very complex tools, 
although, for reasons of computational efﬁciency, simplifying assumptions (parametrizations) must still be made. For ex-
ample, the atmosphere in a global model requires discretization, which is generally done by decomposing it into boxes of 
a speciﬁc size. Processes acting on smaller scales than the boxes cannot be treated individually and must be parametrized, 
that is, their effects must be prescribed by functional dependencies of resolved quantities.

and Salby, 1999; Randel et al., 2002). The effect of changes in 
PWD on the ozone distribution is understood in general terms, 
but its quantiﬁcation in observations is relatively crude.
 
The seasonality of the long-term changes in mid-latitude 
column ozone differs between hemispheres. In the NH, the 
maximum decrease is found in spring, and it decays through 
to late autumn. Fioletov and Shepherd (2003) have shown that 
in the NH the ozone decreases in summer and early autumn are 
the photochemically damped signal of winter-spring losses, and 
thus arise from the winter-spring losses (however they occur) 
without any need for perturbed chemistry in the summertime. 
The same seasonality is not enough for explaining the summer 
and early autumn ozone decreases observed in the SH mid-la-
titudes (Fioletov and Shepherd, 2003) because they are com-
parable with the winter-spring losses and therefore point to the 
inﬂuence of transport of ozone-depleted air into mid-latitudes 
following the break-up of the ozone hole.
 
In summary, the vertical, latitudinal and seasonal character-
istics of past changes in mid-latitude ozone are broadly consist-
ent with the understanding that halogens are the primary cause 
of these changes. However, to account for decadal variations 
it is necessary to include consideration of the interplay be-
tween dynamical and chemical effects as well as the impact of 
variations in aerosol loading (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4); our in- 
adequate quantitative understanding of these processes limits 
our predictive capability.
1.4.1.2 
Winter-spring polar depletion
Polar ozone depletion in the winter-spring period is generally 
considered separately from mid-latitude depletion, because of 
the extremely severe depletion that can occur in polar regions 
from heterogeneous chemistry on PSCs (Section 1.3.1). We 
consider ﬁrst the Antarctic, and then the Arctic.
 
The Antarctic ozone hole represents the most striking exam-
ple of ozone depletion in the atmosphere. It developed through 
the 1980s as chlorine loading increased, and has recurred every 
year since then (Figure 1.5). The Antarctic ozone hole has been 
clearly attributed to anthropogenic chlorine through ﬁeld cam-
paigns and photochemical modelling (WMO, 1999, Chapter 7). 
An ozone hole now occurs every year because, in addition to the 
availability of anthropogenic chlorine, wintertime temperatures 
in the Antarctic lower stratosphere are always low enough for 
chlorine activation to occur on PSCs prior to the return of sun-
light to the vortex in the spring, and the air is always sufﬁciently 
isolated within the vortex for it to become strongly depleted of 
ozone (see Box 1.1). There is nevertheless dynamically induced 
variability in the extent and severity of the ozone hole, as seen 
in Figure 1.5. The most dramatic instance of such variability 
occurred in 2002, when the Antarctic stratosphere experienced 
its ﬁrst observed sudden warming (see Box 1.6). The sudden 
warming split the vortex in two (ﬁgure in Box 1.6) and halted 
the development of the ozone hole that year. Such events occur 
commonly in the NH, as a result of the stronger planetary-wave 
forcing in the NH, but had never before been seen in the SH, 
although there had been previous instances of disturbed winters 
(e.g., 1988). Although unprecedented, this event resulted from 
dynamical variability and was not indicative of ozone recovery; 
indeed, the ozone hole in 2003 was back to a severity character-
istic of the 1990s (Figure 1.5 and ﬁgure in Box 1.6). 
 
Given the fairly predictable nature of the Antarctic ozone 
hole, its simulation constitutes a basic test for models. Two-
dimensional models are not expected to represent the ozone 
hole well because they cannot properly represent isolation of 
polar vortex air (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4), and their estimates 
of Antarctic ozone loss vary greatly. However, an emerging 
tool for attribution is the 3-D chemistry-climate model (CCM). 
These models include an on-line feedback of chemical compo-
sition to the dynamical and radiative components of the model. 
The CCMs currently available have been developed with an 
emphasis on the troposphere and stratosphere. They consider 
a wide range of chemical, dynamical and radiative feedback 
processes and can be used to address the question of why 
changes in stratospheric dynamics and chemistry may have oc-
curred as a result of anthropogenic forcing. The models specify 
WMGHGs, source gases, aerosols and often SSTs, but other-
wise run freely and exhibit considerable interannual variability 
(in contrast with the 2-D models). Thus in addition to issues of 
model accuracy, it is necessary to consider how representative 
are the model simulations.
 
In recent years a number of CCMs have been employed to 
examine the effects of climate change on ozone (Austin et al., 
2003). They have been used for long-term simulations to try to 
reproduce observed past changes, such as ozone and tempera-
ture trends. The models have been run either with ﬁxed forcings 
to investigate the subsequent ‘equilibrium climate’ (so-called 
time-slice runs) or with time-varying forcings (so-called tran-
sient runs). The current CCMs can reproduce qualitatively the 
most important atmospheric features (e.g., stratospheric winds 
and temperatures, and ozone columns and proﬁles) with respect 
to the mean conditions and the seasonal and interannual vari-
ability; the long-term changes in the dynamical and chemical 
composition of the upper troposphere and the stratosphere are 
also in reasonable agreement with observations. But a reason-
able reproduction of the timing of the ozone hole and an ade-
quate description of total column ozone do not necessarily mean 
that all processes in the CCMs are correctly captured. There are 
obvious discrepancies between the models themselves, and be-
tween model results and detailed observations. Some of the dif-
ferences among the models are caused by the fact that the spe-
ciﬁc model systems employed differ considerably, not only in 
complexity (e.g., the number of chemical reactions considered 
and the parametrization of sub-grid-scale processes), but also 
in the vertical extent of the model domain and in the horizontal 
and vertical resolutions. 
 
An important difference between models and observations 
originates to a large extent from the cold bias (the ‘cold-pole 
problem’) that is found in the high latitudes of many CCMs, 
particularly near the tropopause and in the lower stratosphere. 
The low-temperature bias of the models is generally largest in 
winter over the South Pole, where it is of the order of 5–10 K;

113
this magnitude of bias could be signiﬁcant in controlling plan-
etary-wave dynamics and restricting the interannual variability 
of the models. A low-temperature bias in the lower stratosphere 
of a model has a signiﬁcant impact not only on model hetero-
geneous chemistry (i.e., leading to enhanced ozone destruction 
via enhanced occurrence of PSCs), but also on the transport of 
chemical species and its potential change due to changes in cir-
culation. Moreover, changes in stratospheric dynamics alter the 
conditions for wave forcing and wave propagation (of small-
scale gravity waves as well as large-scale planetary waves), 
which in turn inﬂuence the seasonal and interannual variability 
of the atmosphere. The reasons for the cold bias in the models 
are still unknown. This bias has been reduced in some models, 
for example by considering non-orographic gravity-wave drag 
schemes (Manzini and McFarlane, 1998), but the problem is 
not yet solved. Without its resolution, the reliability of these 
models for attribution and prediction is reduced.
 
Despite these potential problems, CCMs simulate the de-
velopment of the Antarctic ozone hole reasonably well (Figure 
1.15). The models examined in the intercomparison of Austin 
et al. (2003) agree with observations of minimum Antarctic 
springtime column ozone over 1980–2000 within the model 
variability (Figure 1.15a), conﬁrming that the Antarctic ozone 
hole is indeed a robust response to anthropogenic chlorine. The 
cold-pole biases of some models seem not to affect minimum 
column ozone too much, although some modelled minima are 
signiﬁcantly lower than observed. None of the models exhib-
ited a sudden warming as seen in 2002, although several exhibit 
Box 1.6. The 2002 Antarctic ozone hole
The unusual behaviour of the Antarctic ozone hole in 2002 highlights the important role that tropospheric climate and 
dynamics play in ozone depletion processes. Year-to-year changes in ozone hole area (or depth) are more likely to reﬂect 
changes in stratospheric dynamics that inﬂuence ozone loss over the short term, rather than long-term issues such as 
changes in stratospheric concentrations of ODSs controlled by the Montreal Protocol. During the early winter of 2002, 
the Antarctic ozone hole was unusually disturbed (Allen et al., 2003; Stolarski et al., 2005) as a result of a series of wave 
events (Newman and Nash, 2005). The anomalously high stratospheric wave activity was forced by strong levels of plan-
etary wave 1 (a single wave encircling the globe) in the mid-latitude lower troposphere and a tropopause wave propagation 
regime that favoured transmission of these waves to the lower stratosphere. The wave events occurred irregularly over the 
course of the winter and preconditioned the polar vortex for an extremely large wave event on 22 September. This large 
wave event resulted in the ﬁrst ever major stratospheric sudden warming to be observed in the SH, which split the Antarctic 
ozone hole in two (see ﬁgure). Such a splitting of the vortex in two is a characteristic signature of wave-2 sudden warmings 
in the NH and is well understood dynamically.
Box 1.6, Figure. Comparison of the ﬁrst split ozone hole on record (middle, 2002) and the Antarctic ozone hole at the same time one year 
earlier (left, 2001) and one year later (right, 2003). The hole is dark blue. In 2001, the area of the ozone layer thinning over Antarctica 
reached 26.5 million km2, larger than the size of the entire North American continent. Because of higher Antarctic winter temperatures, 
the 2002 ‘hole’ appears to be about 40% smaller than in 2001. In 2003, Antarctic winter temperatures returned to normal and the ozone 
hole returned to its usual state. Figure provided by Stuart Snodgrass, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientiﬁc Visualization Studio

years with a disturbed vortex, as seen in their interannual vari-
ability in minimum column ozone. (The models with cold-pole 
biases appear to underestimate the observed variability of the 
ozone hole, as would be expected.) However, minimum total 
ozone is not the only diagnostic of the ozone hole. Figure 1.15b 
shows the modelled ozone hole area in comparison with obser-
vations. Many models signiﬁcantly underestimate the area of 
the ozone hole.
 
In contrast with the Antarctic, winter-spring ozone abun-
dance in the Arctic exhibits signiﬁcant year-to-year variability, 
as seen in Figure 1.6. This variability arises from the highly dis-
turbed nature of Arctic stratospheric dynamics, including rela-
tively frequent sudden warmings (every 2 to 4 years). Because 
dynamical variability affects both transport and temperature, 
dynamical and chemical effects on ozone are coupled. The dy-
namical variability is controlled by stratospheric PWD; years 
with strong PWD, compared with years with weak PWD, have 
stronger downwelling over the pole, and thus higher tempera-
tures, a weaker vortex and more ozone transport (Newman et 
al., 2001). Because low temperatures and a stronger vortex tend 
to favour chemical ozone loss in the presence of elevated halo-
gen levels (Section 1.3.2), it follows that dynamical and chemi-
cal effects tend to act in concert. In the warmest years (e.g., 
1999) there is essentially no chemical ozone loss and ozone  
levels are similar to those seen pre-1980. The chemical ozone 
loss was calculated for cold years using various methods in 
Section 3.3 of WMO (2003), and the agreement between the 
methods provided conﬁdence in the estimates. The calculations 
showed a roughly linear relationship between chemical ozone 
loss and temperature (see also Figure 1.13, which shows the re-
lationship of ozone loss to VPSC, which itself varies linearly with 
temperature (Rex et al., 2004)). Furthermore, the in situ chemi-
cal ozone loss was found to account for roughly one half of the 
observed ozone decrease between cold years and warm years. 
Given the high conﬁdence in the estimates of chemical ozone 
loss, the remaining half can be attributed to reduced ozone 
transport, as is expected in cold years with weak PWD, a strong 
vortex, and weak downwelling over the pole. From this it can 
be concluded that in cold years, chlorine chemistry doubled the 
ozone decrease that would have occurred from transport alone 
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 3).
 
Compared with other recent decades, the 1990s had an un-
usually high number of cold years, and these led to low values 
of Arctic ozone (Figure 1.6). In more recent years, Arctic ozone 
has been generally higher, although still apparently below pre-
1980 values. This behaviour does not reﬂect the time evolution 
of stratospheric chlorine loading (Figure 1.7d). Rather, it re-
ﬂects the meteorological variability in the presence of chlorine 
loading. In this respect the Arctic ozone record needs to be in-
terpreted in the context of the meteorology of a given year, far 
more than is generally the case in the Antarctic.
 
This interpretation of Arctic ozone changes is consistent 
with the fact that the observed decrease in Arctic stratospheric 
temperature over 1980–2000 cannot be explained from direct 
radiative forcing due to ozone depletion or changes in green-

house gases alone (Shine et al., 2003), although they do make 
a contribution. The inference is that the observed springtime 
cooling was mainly the result of decadal meteorological vari-
ability in PWD. This is in contrast with the Antarctic, where the 
observed cooling in November and the prolonged persistence 
of the vortex have been shown to be the result of the ozone 
hole (Randel and Wu, 1999; Waugh et al., 1999). These results 
(for both hemispheres) are illustrated by Figure 1.16. There is 
seen to be little impact from CO2 at these altitudes over this 
time period. In the Arctic, the cooling induced by ozone loss is 
too small and too late in the season to account for the observed 
cooling. Rather, as discussed above, the observed cooling is re-
quired in order to initiate severe Arctic ozone depletion.
 
It is not known what has caused the recent decadal varia-
tions in Arctic temperature. Rex et al. (2004) have argued that 
the value of VPSC in cold years has systematically increased 
since the 1960s. However, the Arctic exhibits signiﬁcant dec-
adal variability (Scaife et al., 2000) and it is not possible to 
exclude natural variability as the cause of these changes. 
 
These considerations have implications for the attribution of 
past changes. No matter how good a CCM is and how well its 
climate-change experiments are characterized, it cannot exactly 
reproduce the real atmosphere because the real atmosphere is 
only one possible realization of a chaotic system. The best one 
can expect, even for a perfect model (that is, a model that cor-
rectly considers all relevant processes), is that the observations 
fall within the range of model-predicted behaviours, according 
to appropriate statistical criteria. Whether this permits a mean-
ingful prediction depends on the relative magnitudes and time 
scales of the forced signal and the natural noise. Whereas the 
evolution of Antarctic ozone is expected to be fairly predictable 
over decadal time scales (past and future), it is not at all clear 
whether this is the case in the Arctic. Thus, it is not a priori ob-
vious that even a perfect CCM would reproduce the decreases 
in Arctic ozone observed over the past 20 years, for example.
 
Bearing these caveats in mind, the simulations of past Arctic 
minimum ozone from the CCMs considered in Austin et al. 
(2003) are shown in Figure 1.17. (Because of the large degree 
of scatter, the results are shown separately for the transient and 
time-slice simulations.) The models seem generally to have a 
positive bias with respect to the observations over the same pe-
riod. None of the CCMs achieve column ozone values as low 
as those observed, and the modelled ozone trends are generally 
smaller than the observed trend (Austin et al., 2003). However, 
the range of variability exhibited by each of the models is con-
siderable, and it is therefore difﬁcult to say that the models are 
deﬁnitely deﬁcient on the basis of the ozone behaviour alone; 
more detailed diagnostics are required – such as comparison 
with the observed relationship shown in Figure 1.13 and with 
observations of other chemical species. 
 
In summary, the development of the Antarctic ozone hole 
through the 1980s was a direct response to increasing chlorine 
loading, and the severity of the ozone decrease has not changed 
since the early 1990s, although there are year-to-year variations 
(especially in 2002, which was a surprising anomaly). In the 
Arctic, the extent of chemical ozone loss due to chlorine de-
pends on the meteorology of a given winter. In winters that are 
cold enough for the existence of PSCs, chemical ozone loss has 
been identiﬁed and acts in concert with reduced transport (the

effects being of a similar magnitude in terms of column ozone 
loss) to give Arctic ozone depletion. There was particularly se-
vere Arctic ozone depletion in many years of the 1990s (and in 
2000), as a result of a series of particularly cold winters. It is not 
known whether this period of low Arctic winter temperatures is 
just natural variability or a response to changes in greenhouse 
gases.
1.4.2 
The Montreal Protocol, future ozone changes and 
their links to climate
The halogen loading of the stratosphere increased rapidly in 
the 1970s and 1980s. As a result of the Montreal Protocol and 
its Amendments and Adjustments, the stratospheric loading 
of chlorine and bromine is expected to decrease slowly in the 
coming decades, reaching pre-1980 levels some time around 
2050 (WMO, 2003, Chapter 1). If chlorine and bromine were 
the only factors affecting stratosphere ozone, we would then 
expect stratospheric ozone to ‘recover’ at about the same time. 
Over this long (about 50-year) time scale, the state of the strato-
sphere may well change because of other anthropogenic effects, 
in ways that affect ozone abundance. For example, increasing 
concentrations of CO2 are expected to further cool the strato-
sphere, and therefore to inﬂuence the rates of ozone destruction. 
Any changes in stratospheric water vapour, CH4 and N2O, all 
of which are difﬁcult to predict quantitatively, will also affect 
stratospheric chemistry and radiation. In addition, natural cli-
mate variability including, volcanic eruptions, can affect ozone 
on decadal time scales. For these reasons, ‘recovery’ of strat-
ospheric ozone is a complicated issue (see Box 1.7). A number 
of model calculations to investigate recovery were reported 
in Chapters 3 and 4 of WMO (2003), using both 2-D and 3-D 
models. The main results from that assessment, and new studies 
reported since then, are summarized here. As with the discus-
sion of past ozone changes, we ﬁrst discuss mid-latitude (or 
global) changes and then polar changes.
1.4.2.1 
Mid-latitude ozone
Predictions of future mid-latitude ozone change in response to 
expected decreasing halogen levels have been extensively dis-
cussed in Chapter 4 of WMO (2003), based primarily on simu-
lations with eight separate 2-D photochemistry models that in-
corporated predicted future changes in halogen loading. Several 
scenarios for future changes in trace climate gases (CO2, N2O 
and CH4) were also incorporated in these simulations (based on 
IPCC, 2001, Chapter 4), although the ozone results were not 
particularly sensitive to which scenario was employed. Results 
of the simulations for the period 1980–2050 are illustrated in 
the ﬁgure in Box 1.7, which shows the range of near-global 
(60°N to 60°S) mean column-ozone anomalies derived from 
the set of 2-D models. The models generally predict a minimum 
in global column ozone in 1992–1993 following the eruption 
of Mt. Pinatubo, followed by steady increases (although some 
models have a secondary minimum in about 2000). The latter 
evolution is primarily determined by changes in atmospheric 
chlorine and bromine loading, which reaches a maximum in 
approximately 1995 and then slowly decreases (Figure 1.7d). 
There is, however, a large spread in the times the models predict 
that global ozone will return to 1980 levels, ranging from 2025 
to after 2050. The spread of results arises in part from the dif-
ferences between the models used.
 
Two of the 2-D models used in the simulations included in-
teractive temperature changes caused by increasing greenhouse 
gases, which result in a long-term cooling of the stratosphere 
(one model includes this feedback throughout the entire strato-
sphere, and the other only above about 30 km). Cooling in the 
upper stratosphere results in slowing of the gas-phase chemical 
cycles that destroy ozone there (Section 1.3.2), and consequent-
ly these two models show a greater increase with time of total 
ozone (deﬁning the upper range in the middle 21st century in 
the ﬁgure in Box 1.7) than the other models. An important ca-
veat is that most of the past (1980–2000) column ozone change 
has occurred in the lower stratosphere, and future temperature 
feedback effects are more complicated and uncertain in the low-
er stratosphere. Furthermore, these effects involve changes in 
transport, heterogeneous chemistry and polar processes, which 
are not accurately simulated in 2-D models. (Note, however, 
that at least one CCM (Pitari et al., 2002) also predicts a simi-
lar fast recovery.) At present there is considerable uncertainty 
regarding the details of temperature feedbacks on future mid-
latitude column ozone changes.
 
Because 2-D models can be expected to capture the main 
chemical processes involved in ozone recovery, reliable predic-
tions of future changes in the coupled ozone-climate system 
require the use of CCMs, since they consider possible changes 
in climate feedback mechanisms. Despite some present limita-
tions, these models have been employed in sensitivity studies 
to assess the global future development of the chemical com-
position of the stratosphere and climate. The results have been 
compared with each other to assess the uncertainties of such 
predictions (Austin et al., 2003), and have been documented in 
international assessment reports (WMO, 2003, Chapter 3; EC, 
2003, Chapter 3). However most of the attention has been fo-
cused on polar ozone.
 
As discussed in Section 1.3.4, two dynamical inﬂuences 
appear to be related to NH mid-latitude ozone decreases over 
1980–2000: a decrease in PWD and an increase in tropopause 
height. These mechanisms likewise have the potential to in-
ﬂuence future ozone. If the past dynamical changes represent 
natural variability, then one cannot extrapolate past dynamical 
trends, and ozone recovery could be either hastened or delayed 
by dynamical variability. If, on the other hand, the past dynami-
cal changes represent the dynamical response to WMGHG-in-
duced climate change, then one might expect these changes to 
increase in magnitude in the future. This would decrease future 
ozone levels and delay ozone recovery. In the case of tropo-
pause height changes, to the extent that they are themselves 
caused by ozone depletion, the changes should reverse in the 
future.
 
Another potential dynamical inﬂuence on ozone arises via

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Box 1.7. Stratospheric ozone recovery 
It is well established that the depletion of the ozone layer, both globally and in the polar regions, is attributable to an at-
mospheric chlorine burden that has been strongly enhanced, compared with natural levels, by anthropogenic emissions of 
halogen-containing compounds. Today, the production of such compounds has largely stopped following the regulations 
of the Montreal Protocol. However, owing to the long lifetime of the most important halogen source gases, the removal of 
these gases from the atmosphere will take many decades. The expectation that they will be ultimately removed is based on 
the assumption that global compliance with the Montreal Protocol will continue.
As a consequence, it might be expected that in about 50 years ozone depletion as it is observed today will have disappeared 
or, in other words, that the ozone layer will have ‘recovered’ (see ﬁgure). However, because of global climate change the 
state of the atmosphere has changed in recent decades and is expected to change further over the coming decades, so that a 
recovery to precisely the pre-1980 (that is, to the pre-‘ozone hole’) conditions will not occur.
Therefore, it is not obvious what should be considered as a detection of the onset of a ‘recovery’ of the ozone layer. A true 
detection of the onset of recovery requires more than the observation of a slow down or even a reversal of a downward 
ozone trend in a particular region, even if known natural periodic signals, such as the quasi-biennial oscillation or the 11-
year solar cycle, have been accounted for. Rather, a detection of the onset of recovery requires that any temporal change in 
ozone in a particular region of the atmosphere can be attributed to the reduction of the atmospheric concentrations of an-
thropogenic halogen compounds as a result of the Montreal Protocol. Although one recent paper (Newchurch et al., 2003) 
has reported that the ﬁrst stage of a recovery of the ozone layer has been detected in observations of upper-stratospheric 
ozone, there is currently no consensus in the scientiﬁc community that the recovery of stratospheric ozone has been un-
equivocally established.
1. The detection of the onset of the recovery of stratospheric ozone will result from careful comparisons of the latest ozone 
measurements with past values. It is expected that ozone recovery will be ﬁrst noticeable as a change in particular fea-
tures, including: An increase in global column ozone towards values observed before 1980, when halogen source-gas 
abundances were much lower than they are today.
2. A sustained reduction in the maximum size of the Antarctic ozone hole, and an increase in the minimum value of column 
ozone in the hole.
3. Less ozone depletion in those Arctic winters in which temperatures fall below the threshold for the existence of polar 
stratospheric clouds (195 K).
As the ozone layer approaches full recovery, we expect to observe changes in all these features.

scenario (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4); some models also allowed 
for the effect on stratospheric temperatures of changing CO2 
amounts. The measurements show that 60°S–60°N column 
ozone values decreased beginning in the early 1980s, and the 
models capture the timing and extent of this decrease quite 
well. Modelled halogen source-gas concentrations decrease 
in the early 21st century in response to the Montreal Protocol 
(Figure 1.7), so the simulated ozone values increase and recover 
towards pre-1980 values. Adapted from Figure Q20-1 of WMO

water vapour. Stratospheric water vapour is controlled by two 
processes: methane oxidation within the stratosphere and the 
transport of water vapour into the stratosphere. The latter de-
pends in large part on the temperature of the tropical tropo-
pause, although the precise details of this relationship remain 
unclear (see Section 1.3.4.4). In the future, changes in tropical 
tropopause temperature could conceivably affect the water va-
pour content of the stratosphere.
 
Unfortunately, our ability to predict future dynamical inﬂu-
ences on ozone is very poor, for two reasons. First, dynamical 
processes affecting ozone exhibit signiﬁcant temporal variabil-
ity and are highly sensitive to other aspects of the atmospheric 
circulation. This means that the WMGHG-induced signal is in-
herently difﬁcult to isolate or to represent accurately in CCMs, 
whereas the climate noise is relatively high (especially in the 
NH). Second, there are still uncertainties in the performance of 
the CCMs, which are the tools needed to address this question. 
As discussed in Section 1.4.1, predictions of WMGHG-induced 
dynamical changes by CCMs do not even agree on the sign 
of the changes: some models predict a weakened PWD, which 
would decrease mid-latitude (and polar) ozone by weakening 
transport, whereas others predict a strengthened PWD. Note 
that these dynamical changes would also affect the lifetime of 
stratospheric pollutants, with stronger PWD leading to shorter 
lifetimes (Rind et al., 1990; Butchart and Scaife, 2001). (The 
latter effect acts on the several-year time scale associated with 
the Brewer-Dobson circulation, in contrast with the essentially 
instantaneous effect of PWD on ozone transport.) Thus, the di-
rect effect of PWD change on ozone transport (no matter what 
its sign) would be reinforced over decadal time scales by al-
tered chemical ozone loss arising from PWD-induced changes 
in stratospheric chlorine loading.
 
To summarize the results from 2-D models, upper-strato-
spheric ozone in the mid-latitudes will recover to pre-1980 
levels well before stratospheric chlorine loading returns to pre-
1980 levels, and could even overshoot pre-1980 levels because 
of CO2-induced upper-stratospheric cooling (see, for example, 
WMO, 2003, Chapter 4). However, details of this future evolu-
tion are sensitive to many factors (uncertain emission scenarios, 
future climate change, changes in water vapour, volcanic erup-
tions, etc.) and there is signiﬁcant divergence between different 
models. In terms of mid-latitude column ozone, where changes 
are expected to be dominated by ozone in the lower stratosphere, 
2-D models all predict a steadily increasing ozone abundance as 
halogen levels decrease. While these models usually include a 
detailed treatment of polar chemistry, they do not include a de-
tailed treatment of polar dynamics and mixing to mid-latitudes, 
or of dynamical aspects of climate change. Any future changes 
in stratospheric circulation and transport, or a large Pinatubo-like 
volcanic eruption, could have the potential to affect global col-
umn ozone, both directly and indirectly via chemical processes. 
Quantitative prediction is clearly difﬁcult. At this stage, CCM 
simulations provide sensitivity calculations, which allow for the 
exploration of some examples of possible future evolution. 
1.4.2.2 
Polar ozone
As noted earlier, 2-D models do not provide a realistic treatment 
of polar processes, so predictions of polar ozone rely princi-
pally on CCMs. An intensive intercomparison of CCM predic-
tions, the ﬁrst of its kind, was performed for Chapter 3 of WMO 
(2003) (see Austin et al., 2003). It is important to recognize 
that, apart from model deﬁciencies, CCM predictions are them-
selves subject to model variability and thus must be viewed in 
a statistical sense. Because of computer limitations (CPU time 
and mass storage), a large number of simulations with a single 
CCM cannot be carried out, so the models cannot yet be gener-
ally employed for ensemble runs. The approach taken in Austin 
et al. (2003) was to regard the collection of different CCMs as 
representing an ensemble. The collection included, moreover, a 
mixture of transient and time-slice runs (see Section 1.4.1).
 
For the Antarctic, where the CCMs all reproduce the de-
velopment of the ozone hole in a reasonably realistic man-
ner, the predicted future evolution is shown in Figure 1.15. 
Considering all the models, there is an overall consensus that 
the recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole will essentially fol-
low the stratospheric chlorine loading. There is a hint in Figure 
1.15 of a slight delay in the recovery compared with the peak 
in chlorine loading, presumably because of a cooling arising 
from the speciﬁed increase in WMGHG concentrations. Austin 
et al. (2003) estimated that the recovery of the Antarctic ozone 
layer can be expected to begin any year within the range 2001 
to 2008. This would mean that Antarctic ozone depletion could 
slightly increase within the next few years despite a decrease 
in stratospheric chlorine loading, because lower temperatures 
would increase chlorine activation. However there is consider-
able natural variability, so it is also quite possible that the most 
severe Antarctic ozone hole has already occurred. 
 
In the Arctic, where ozone depletion is more sensitive to me-
teorological conditions, the picture drawn by the CCMs is not 
consistent (Figure 1.17). Whereas most CCMs also predict a de-
layed start of Arctic ozone recovery (according to Austin et al. 
(2003), any year within the range 2004 to 2019), others indicate 
a different development: they simulate an enhanced PWD that 
produces a more disturbed and warmer NH stratospheric vortex 
in the future. (Enhanced PWD would also lead to a stronger me-
ridional circulation and faster removal of CFCs.) This ‘dynami-
cal heating’ more than compensates for the radiative cooling 
due to enhanced greenhouse-gas concentrations. Under these 
circumstances, and in combination with reduced stratospheric 
chlorine concentrations, polar ozone in these CCMs recovers 
within the next decade to values measured before the start of 
stratospheric ozone depletion. However, none of the current 
models suggest that an ‘ozone hole’, similar to that observed 
in the Antarctic, will occur over the Arctic (Figure 1.17). In this 
respect, the earlier GISS result (Shindell et al., 1998), which 
is also depicted in Figure 1.17a, has not been supported by the 
more recent models (Austin et al., 2003; WMO, 2003, Chapter 
3). Analyses of model results show that the choice of the pre-
scribed SSTs seems to play a critical role in the planetary-wave 
forcing (Schnadt and Dameris, 2003). Predicted SSTs (derived

from coupled atmosphere-ocean models) vary in response to 
the same forcings that are already included in CCMs. Realistic 
predictions of future SSTs are therefore a necessary prerequi-
site for stratospheric circulation predictions, at least in the NH 
extratropics. 
 
The differences between the currently available CCM results 
clearly indicate the uncertainties in the assessment of the future 
development of polar ozone. In the NH the differences are more 
pronounced than in the SH. Part of these differences arises from 
the highly variable nature of the NH circulation, as is reﬂected 
in the past record (Section 1.4.1). Until now, the different tran-
sient model predictions have been based on single realizations, 
not ensembles, so it is not yet possible to determine whether 
the differences between the models – with the sole exception 
of the GISS results shown in Figure 1.17, which are signiﬁ-
cantly different from the other model results – are statistically 
signiﬁcant. The time-slice simulations give some indication of 
the range of natural variability that is possible, and allow for a 
wide range of future possibilities. Nevertheless there are also 
signiﬁcant uncertainties arising from the performance of the un-
derlying dynamical models. Cold biases have been found in the 
stratosphere of many of the models, with obvious direct conse-
quences for chemistry. In consequence, at the current stage of 
model development, uncertainties in the details of PSC forma-
tion and sedimentation (denitriﬁcation) might be less important 
than model temperature biases for simulating accurate ozone 
amounts, although it is possible that the models underestimate 
the sensitivity of chemical ozone loss to temperature changes. 
However, because it has been shown that denitriﬁcation does 
contribute signiﬁcantly to Arctic ozone loss and is very sensitive 
to temperature, both problems have to be solved before a reli-
able estimate of future Arctic ozone losses is possible. Further 
investigations and model developments, combined with data 
analysis, are needed in order to reduce or eliminate these vari-
ous model deﬁciencies and quantify the natural variability. 
 
In summary, the Antarctic ozone hole is expected to recover 
more or less following the decrease in chlorine loading, and 
return to 1980 levels in the 2045 to 2055 time frame. There may 
be a slight delay arising from WMGHG-induced cooling, but 
natural variability in the extent of the ozone hole is sufﬁciently 
large that the most severe ozone hole may have already oc-
curred, or may occur in the next ﬁve years or so. With regard to 
the Arctic, the future evolution of ozone is potentially sensitive 
to climate change and to natural variability, and will not neces-
sarily follow strictly the chlorine loading. There is uncertainty 
in even the sign of the dynamical feedback to WMGHG chang-
es. Numerical models like CCMs are needed to make sensitivity 
studies to estimate possible future changes, although they are 
currently not fully evaluated and their deﬁciencies are obvious. 
Therefore, the interpretation of such ‘predictions’ must be per-
formed with care. Progress will result from further development 
of CCMs and from comparisons of results between models and 
with observations. This will help to get a better understanding 
of potential feedbacks in the atmosphere, thereby leading to 
more reliable estimates of future changes.
1.5 
Climate change from ODSs, their substitutes and 
ozone depletion
Previous sections in this chapter have primarily been concerned 
with complex interactions between stratospheric ozone loss and 
the climate of the stratosphere, including past and future behav-
iour. In this section we discuss and use the concept of radiative 
forcing to quantify the effect of ODSs and their substitutes on 
surface climate. Radiative forcing is used to quantify the direct 
role of these compounds, as well as their indirect role through 
stratospheric ozone depletion. Section 1.5.1 discusses the appli-
cability of radiative forcing, Section 1.5.2 examines the direct 
radiative forcing from ODSs and their substitutes, and Section 
1.5.3 goes on to discuss their indirect radiative forcing. Lastly, 
Section 1.5.4 presents an example scenario for the net (direct 
plus indirect) radiative forcing from the ODSs and their sub-
stitutes, placing it within our general understanding of climate 
change.
1.5.1 
Radiative forcing and climate sensitivity
Sections 1.5.2 to 1.5.4 compare the radiative forcings from 
halocarbons and ozone to assess their roles in climate change. 
To make this comparison we have to assume that (a) radiative 
forcings can be compared between different mechanisms and 
(b) radiative forcing is related to the climate change issue of 
interest. The ﬁrst assumption is equivalent to saying that the cli-
mate sensitivity (λ) is constant between different mechanisms 
(see Box 1.3), and is implicit whenever direct and indirect ra-
diative forcings are compared (e.g., Section 1.5.4).
 
However, several climate modelling studies have found 
that for many climate mechanisms λ varies with the latitude 
of the imposed forcing, and is higher for changes in the extra-
tropics than for changes in the tropics (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 
6; Joshi et al., 2003). Additionally, several climate-modelling 
studies have compared the climate sensitivity for stratospheric 
ozone increases (WMO, 2003, Chapter 4; Joshi et al., 2003) 
and generally found that global stratospheric ozone increases 
have a 20–80% higher climate sensitivity than carbon dioxide. 
This ﬁnding has been attributed to an additional positive feed-
back that results from an increase in stratospheric water vapour, 
which in turn arises from a warmer tropical tropopause (Stuber 
et al., 2001; Joshi et al., 2003). However, the latter studies all 
used idealized stratospheric ozone changes, and to date no study 
has performed similar analyses with realistic ozone changes. 
 
Climate models also typically have different responses 
to equivalent forcings from carbon dioxide and from other 
WMGHGs (Wang et al., 1992; Govindasamy et al., 2001); 
these results indicate possible differences in climate sensitivity 
for CO2 and halocarbons. The two studies that have examined 
this directly reached contradictory conclusions. Hansen et al. 
(1997) found halocarbons to have about a 20% larger climate 
sensitivity than carbon dioxide, mainly because of a stronger 
positive cloud feedback in their halocarbon experiments. In 
contrast, Forster and Joshi (2005) found that, because halocar-

121
bons preferentially heat the tropical tropopause region rather 
than the surface (see Box 1.4), climate sensitivity for halocar-
bon changes was 6% smaller than for carbon dioxide changes.
 
The trade-off or partial cancellation between direct and indi-
rect radiative forcing discussed in Section 1.5.4 only occurs in 
the global mean: the latitudinal forcing patterns actually com-
plement each other. Both stratospheric ozone depletion and in-
creases in halocarbons realize more positive forcing in the trop-
ics and more negative forcing at higher latitudes (IPCC, 2001, 
Chapter 6). Therefore, the variation in climate sensitivity with 
latitude of any applied forcing would likely mean that, even if 
the halocarbon and ozone forcing cancelled each other out in 
the global mean (to give a net forcing of zero), an overall global 
cooling would result. Further, the patterns of surface tempera-
ture response may well be distinct.
 
Radiative forcing estimates, such as those shown in Figure 
1.3, are measured as changes from pre-industrial times and are 
indicative of the equilibrium surface temperature change one 
might have expected since then. Radiative forcing is not nec-
essarily indicative of patterns of temperature change, transient 
temperature changes or other metrics. In reality, only 60–80% 
of the temperature changes associated with the radiative forc-
ing shown in Figure 1.3 would have already been realized in 
the observed surface warming of the last 150+ years (IPCC, 
2001, Chapter 6). From any time period, such as the present, 
future temperature changes will come from the combination of 
temperatures continuing to respond to past radiative forcing and 
any new changes to the radiative forcing. The rate of change of 
radiative forcing is potentially more important for evaluating 
short-term climate change and possibilities for mitigation than 
the total radiative forcing. It is therefore useful to examine the 
rate, as well as the total radiative forcing (Solomon and Daniel, 
1996).
 
In summary, adopting radiative forcing and examining its 
rate of change are among the best methods for comparing the 
climate roles of carbon dioxide, ozone-depleting gases, their 
substitutes and ozone. However, radiative forcing gives an esti-
mate only of the equilibrium globally averaged surface tempe-
rature response, and could lead to errors of around 50% (given 
the range in model results discussed above) when comparing 
the predicted global mean temperature change from ozone and 
the halocarbons with that from carbon dioxide. 
1.5.2 
Direct radiative forcing of ODSs and their 
substitutes
The direct radiative forcing from the ozone-depleting gases 
and their substitutes are relatively well known, and have been 
comprehensively assessed in Chapter 1 of WMO (2003) and 
Chapter 6 of IPCC (2001). The radiative forcing of the sub-
stitute gases is re-assessed in Chapter 2 of this report. The ra-
diative forcings of the ODSs have individual uncertainties of 
about 10%, and together they have contributed about 0.26 W 
m–2 (22%) to the total WMGHG radiative forcing since 1970 
(Figure 1.3; Table 1.1).
 Table 1.1. Positive direct radiative forcing by WMGHGs, including 
halocarbon gases, since 1750 and since 1970, and negative indirect 
radiative forcing since 1980 (no indirect forcing occurred prior to 
1980). Based on data in Chapter 6 of IPCC (2001) and Chapter 1 
of WMO (2003). Totals may not sum up consistently because of 
rounding.

Chapter 6 of IPCC (2001) for the other gases. The EESC has been calculated using data in Chapter 1 of WMO (2003), assuming that bromine is 
45 times more effective on a per-atom basis at destroying ozone than chlorine. The change in EESC between 1979 and 1997 is assumed to give 
an indirect radiative forcing of –0.15 W m–2 (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 6). This radiative forcing scales with EESC amounts above the 1979 threshold.

Section 1.2.2 discussed past changes and a future scenario 
for the abundances of the ozone-depleting gases. Chapter 2 dis-
cusses a range of future scenarios for the substitute gases. In 
this section we examine scenarios for future radiative forcing 
of the ODSs themselves. One possible future scenario is the 
A1B scenario from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios 
(SRES; IPCC, 2000), which for the ODSs is consistent with the 
Ab scenario from WMO (2003). Figure 1.18a shows a time-
series of radiative forcing for the different groups of gases for 
this scenario. The ﬁgure shows that the current radiative forcing 
from ODSs is beginning to decline. However, because of their 
long lifetime in the atmosphere and their continued emission 
from the ‘ODS bank’ (namely those ODSs that have already 
been manufactured but have not yet been released into the at-
mosphere), they could dominate the radiative forcing for the 
next four to ﬁve decades. In this scenario HFCs dominate the 
radiative forcing by the end of the century, but this is only one 
example of several possible scenarios (see Chapter 2).
 
As the production of ODSs has now essentially ceased 
(WMO, 2003, Chapter 1), the principal issue for the emissions 
of ODSs concerns the treatment of the ODS bank. The scenario 
for ODSs in Figure 1.18a includes continued emissions of ODSs 
from the ODS bank, and if these emissions from the bank could 
be cut by recovering the ODSs, the radiative forcing time-series 
could be somewhat altered. Figure 1.19 illustrates the role of 
post-2004 releases from the ODS bank in continuing the ODS 
radiative forcing, and compares it with the HFC radiative forc-
ing. If emissions of ODSs from the bank continue at their cur-
rent rate, ODS radiative forcing will still decrease. However, 
for at least the next two decades, the continued emission from 
the ODS bank is expected to have a comparable contribution 
to the total radiative forcing with that of HFC emissions. This 
calculation does not take into account the effect that ODSs have 
on the stratospheric ozone radiative forcing, which is discussed 
next. 
1.5.3 
Indirect radiative forcing of ODSs
IPCC (2001) gives the value for the radiative forcing of strato-
spheric ozone as –0.15 W m–2, with a range of ±0.1 W m–2. This 
radiative forcing primarily arises from mid-and high-latitude 
ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere (see Box 1.3). Past 
calculations of this radiative forcing have extensively employed 
observed trends in ozone. It is generally assumed that these ob-
served ozone trends have been caused entirely by emissions of 
ODSs, so the negative radiative forcing of stratospheric ozone 
can be thought of as ‘indirect’. For the ODSs it is possible to 
calculate EESC values and use them to scale the ozone radia-
tive forcing (see Box 1.8). EESC values for different ODSs are 
shown in Figure 1.18b. The indirect radiative forcing of each 
ODS is shown in Figure 1.18c. These values have been calcu-
lated by assuming that EESC values above a 1979 background 
level give a forcing that scales with the –0.15 W m–2 best-esti-
mate forcing from Chapter 6 of IPCC (2001) over 1979–1997. 
This calculation follows the approaches of Daniel et al. (1999) 
and Forster and Joshi (2005). It results in a value of the indirect 
forcing that is purely from stratospheric ozone loss and ignores 
any possible changes to tropospheric chemistry and climate, 
which are discussed in Chapter 2. Table 1.1 shows the indirect 
radiative forcing of stratospheric ozone broken down by spe-
cies.
 
Uncertainties in the indirect radiative forcing of stratospher-
ic ozone arise from many different factors:
• The quoted IPCC (2001, Chapter 6) range of ±0.1 W m–2 for 
the radiative forcing of stratospheric ozone is based on dif-
fering model results and arises primarily from the underly-
ing uncertainty in the vertical distribution of the ozone trend 
relative to the tropopause. The quoted range can be used to 
scale the indirect radiative forcing in Figure 1.18c, as shown 
with the error bars in Figure 1.18e.
• The future radiative forcing from ozone is in fact more un-
certain than the range quoted in IPCC (2001) because there 
is a lack of conﬁdence in the details of future ozone chang-
es, particularly near the tropopause, and many different sce-
narios are possible. These scenarios are discussed further in 
Section 1.5.4.
• Although most of the ozone changes can be attributed to 
ODSs, a sizeable fraction of the NH changes could have oth-
Figure 1.19. Direct radiative forcing of all ODSs compared with that 
of SRES projections for HFCs. The direct radiative forcing is split up 
into contributions from the commitment of past emissions (solid black 
line), release of allowed new production under the Montreal Protocol 
(grey shaded area), and release from ODS banks existing in 2004. 
Two estimates are given for these latter emissions, one based on bank 
estimates from WMO (2003), and one based on estimates in Ashford 
et al. (2004) – see Chapter 11. Radiative forcing due to HFCs is shown 
for the SRES B1 and A1B scenarios (boundaries of the red shaded 
area). The contribution due to the delayed release of ODSs in banks 
is shown separately and is comparable to that projected due to HFCs 
for the next two decades. ODSs also have other effects on radiative 
forcing.

er causes, especially those that occur close to the tropopause 
(Section 1.4.1). This means that a small but possibly signiﬁ-
cant part of the radiative forcing of stratospheric ozone may 
not be attributable to ODSs (Forster and Tourpali, 2001).
• The simple linear scaling between EESC values, above a 
1979 background level, and the stratospheric ozone radia-
tive forcing is used for obtaining an approximation to the 
ozone radiative forcing time-series. It was ﬁrst proposed by 
Daniel et al. (1999). For EESC values below the 1979 level 
there is assumed to be no ozone depletion and no indirect 
radiative forcing. This simplistic approximation does not 
take into account the many chemistry and climate feedbacks 
discussed in this chapter (see also Daniel et al., 1999).
1.5.4 
Net radiative forcing
Figures 1.18d–f show the direct, indirect and net radiative forc-
ing time-series for the ODSs and other WMGHGs, based on 
the data in Figures 1.18a–c. These time-series depend critically 
on which scenario is used, which in the case of Figure 1.18 is 
the A1B SRES scenario from IPCC (2000). Nevertheless the 
ﬁgure gives one estimate of the possible global mean trade-offs 
Box 1.8. Ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) and equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC)
Ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) are used as a simple measure for quantifying the effect of various ozone-depleting 
compounds on the ozone layer, and have proved to be an important quantity for the formulation of the Montreal Protocol 
and its Amendments. The ODP is deﬁned as the integrated change in total ozone per unit mass emission of a speciﬁc ozone-
depleting substance relative to the integrated change in total ozone per unit mass emission of CFC-11 (WMO, 1995; WMO, 
2003).
For the calculation of the ODP of an ozone-depleting substance, the change in total ozone per unit mass of emission of this 
substance may be determined with numerical models. As an alternative, Solomon et al. (1992) have formulated a semi-em-
pirical approach for determining ODPs based mainly on observations rather than on models.
The quantities required for the semi-empirical approach are the physical properties of the halocarbons, their lifetimes, the 
so-called fractional release factor Φ – a factor representing the factor of inorganic halogen release in the stratosphere from 
observations relative to CFC-11 – and in the case of bromine, a quantiﬁcation of the catalytic efﬁciency of ozone destruction 
relative to chlorine. For long-lived gases that are well mixed in the troposphere the deﬁnition of the semi-empirical ODP of 
a particular halogen compound is (Solomon et al., 1992; Chapter 1 of WMO, 2003)
Here, τ is the global lifetime of the long-lived gas, M is the molecular weight, n is the number of halogen atoms and α is 
the relative efﬁciency of any halogen compound compared with chlorine. For bromine, α = 45 (Daniel et al., 1999). The 
current best estimates of ODPs by both the model and the semi-empirical methods are listed in Table 1.2 together with the 
ODP values originally adopted for the formulation of the Montreal Protocol.
The equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (ESSC) is an index that is similar to an ODP. It relates the total stratospheric 
chlorine and bromine levels to the tropospheric release of halocarbons. It was deﬁned as a mixing ratio by Daniel et al. 
(1995):

− 3 represents the stratospheric halocarbon mixing ratio at time t, and accounts for the approximately three years it 
takes to travel from the source of emission into the lower stratosphere; FCFC-11 is the fractional release of halogens into the 
stratosphere from CFC-11, which is considered to be proportional to the change in column ozone.

involved in assessing the role of halocarbons in climate. Direct 
radiative forcing from halocarbons has risen sharply since 
1980. However, ozone depletion has contributed a negative in-
direct forcing. Uncertainties in the magnitude of the indirect 
forcing are sufﬁciently large that the net radiative forcing since 
1980 may have either increased or decreased (Figure 1.18e). 
The best estimate is that the indirect forcing has largely offset 
the increase in the direct radiative forcing. This suggests that 
surface temperatures over the last few decades would have in-
creased even more rapidly if stratospheric ozone depletion had 
not occurred. However, it is important to note that ozone deple-
tion since 1980 is the result, in part, of ODS increases prior to 
1980.
 
The balance between direct and indirect radiative forcing 
varies substantially between different classes of ODSs (Table 
1.1). For the halons, the negative indirect forcing dominates 
their very small positive direct effect, causing their net forcing 
to be negative. In contrast, the CFCs and HCFCs have a net 
positive radiative forcing, despite their associated ozone loss. 
 
The scenario shown in Figure 1.18 assumes that concen-
trations of ODS substitutes will increase rapidly in the future 
while those of the ODSs will decay. In that case, even though 
the direct radiative forcing of the halocarbons would decrease 
during the next few decades, the net forcing would actually in-
crease because of ozone recovery. (Note that the future posi-
tive forcing from ozone recovery is not included in the SRES 
scenarios.) However, this increase in net forcing depends on 
which scenario is used for the ODS substitutes. The detailed 
quantiﬁcation of the radiative forcing from the ODS substitutes 
is discussed in Chapter 2.

Chapter 2: Chemical and Radiative Effects of Halocarbons and Their Replacement Compounds
135
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
• Human-made halocarbons, including chloroﬂuorocarbons 
(CFCs), perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs), hydroﬂuorocarbons 
(HFCs) and hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs), are 
effective absorbers of infrared radiation, so that even 
small amounts of these gases contribute to the radiative 
forcing of the climate system. Some of these gases and 
their replacements also contribute to stratospheric ozone 
depletion and to the deterioration of local air quality. 
Concentrations and radiative forcing of ﬂuorinated gases and 
replacement chemicals
• HCFCs of industrial importance have lifetimes in the range 
1.3–20 years. Their global-mean tropospheric concentrations 
in 2003, expressed as molar mixing ratios (parts per trillion, 
ppt, 10–12), were 157 ppt for HCFC-22, 16 ppt for HCFC-
141b, and 14 ppt for HCFC-142b.
• HFCs of industrial importance have lifetimes in the 
range 1.4–270 years. In 2003 their observed atmospheric 
concentrations were 17.5 ppt for HFC-23, 2.7 ppt for HFC-
125, 26 ppt for HFC-134a, and 2.6 ppt for HFC-152a.
• The observed atmospheric concentrations of these HCFCs 
and HFCs can be explained by anthropogenic emissions, 
within the range of uncertainties in calibration and emission 
estimates.
• PFCs and SF6 have lifetimes in the range 1000–50,000 years 
and make an essentially permanent contribution to radiative 
forcing. Concentrations in 2003 were 76 ppt for CF4, 2.9 
ppt for C2F6, and 5 ppt for SF6. Both anthropogenic and 
natural sources of CF4 are needed to explain its observed 
atmospheric abundance.
• Global and regional emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs 
have been derived from observed concentrations and can 
be used to check emission inventory estimates. Global 
emissions of HCFC-22 have risen steadily over the period 
1975–2000, whereas those of HCFC-141b, HCFC-142b and 
HFC-134a started to increase quickly in the early 1990s. In 
Europe, sharp increases in emissions occurred for HFC-
134a over 1995–1998 and for HFC-152a over 1996–2000, 
with some levelling off of both through 2003.
• Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ammonia (NH3), 
which are considered as replacement species for refrigerants 
or foam blowing agents, have lifetimes of several months or 
less, hence their distributions are spatially and temporally 
variable. It is therefore difﬁcult to quantify their climate 
impacts with single globally averaged numbers. The direct 
and indirect radiative forcings associated with their use as 
substitutes are very likely to have a negligible effect on 
global climate because of their small contribution to existing 
VOC and NH3 abundances in the atmosphere.
• The lifetimes of many halocarbons depend on the 
concentration of the hydroxyl radical (OH), which might 
change in the 21st century as a result of changes in emissions 
of carbon monoxide, natural and anthropogenic VOCs, 
and nitrogen oxides, and as a result of climate change and 
changes in tropospheric ultraviolet radiation. The sign and 
magnitude of the future change in OH concentrations are 
uncertain, and range from –18 to +5% for the year 2100, 
depending on the emission scenario. For the same emissions 
of halocarbons, a decrease in future OH would lead to 
higher concentrations of these halocarbons and hence would 
increase their radiative forcing, whereas an increase in 
future OH would lead to lower concentrations and smaller 
radiative forcing.
• The ODSs have contributed 0.32 W m–2 (13%) to the direct 
radiative forcing of all well-mixed greenhouse gases, relative 
to pre-industrial times. This contribution is dominated by 
CFCs. The current (2003) contributions of HFCs and PFCs 
to the total radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases 
are 0.0083 W m–2 (0.31%) and 0.0038 W m–2 (0.15%), 
respectively.
• Based on the emissions reported in Chapter 11 of this 
report, the estimated radiative forcing of HFCs in 2015 
is in the range of 0.019–0.030 W m–2 compared with the 
range 0.022–0.025 W m–2 based on projections in the IPCC 
Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). Based on 
SRES projections, the radiative forcing of HFCs and PFCs 
corresponds to about 6–10% and 2%, respectively, of the 
total estimated radiative forcing due to CFCs and HCFCs in 
2015. 
• Projections of emissions over longer time scales become more 
uncertain because of the growing inﬂuence of uncertainties 
in technological practices and policies. However, based on 
the range of SRES emission scenarios, the contribution of 
HFCs to radiative forcing in 2100 could range from 0.1 
to 0.25 W m–2 and of from PFCs 0.02 to 0.04 W m–2. In 
comparison, the forcing from carbon dioxide (CO2) in these 
scenarios ranges from about 4.0 to 6.7 W m–2 in 2100.
• Actions taken under the Montreal Protocol and its 
Adjustments and Amendments have led to the replacement 
of CFCs with HCFCs, HFCs, and other substances, and 
to changing of industrial processes. These actions have 
begun to reduce atmospheric chlorine loading. Because 
replacement species generally have lower global warming 
potentials (GWPs), and because total halocarbon emissions 
have decreased, the total CO2-equivalent emission (direct 
GWP-weighted using a 100-year time horizon) of all 
halocarbons has also been reduced. The combined CO2-
equivalent emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs decreased 
from a peak of about 7.5 ± 0.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 around 1990 
to about 2.5 ± 0.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 in the year 2000, which 
corresponds to about 10% of that year’s CO2 emissions from 
global fossil-fuel burning.
Banks
• Continuing observations of CFCs and other ODSs in the 
atmosphere enable improved validation of estimates of the 
lag between production and emission to the atmosphere, 
and of the associated banks of these gases. Because new

production of ODSs has been greatly reduced, annual 
changes in their concentrations are increasingly dominated 
by releases from existing banks. The decrease in the 
atmospheric concentrations of several gases is placing 
tighter constraints on their derived emissions and banks. 
This information provides new insights into the signiﬁcance 
of banks and end-of-life options for applications using 
HCFCs and HFCs as well.
• Current banked halocarbons will make a substantial 
contribution to future radiative forcing of climate for 
many decades unless a large proportion of these banks 
is destroyed. Large portions of the global inventories of 
CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs currently reside in banks. For 
example, it is estimated that about 50% of the total global 
inventory of HFC-134a currently resides in the atmosphere 
and 50% resides in banks. One top-down estimate based 
on past reported production and on detailed comparison 
with atmospheric-concentration changes suggests that 
if the current banks of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs were to 
be released to the atmosphere, their corresponding GWP-
weighted emissions (using a 100-year time horizon) would 
represent about 2.6, 3.4 and 1.2 GtCO2-eq, respectively. 
• If all the ODSs in banks in 2004 were not released to the 
atmosphere, the direct positive radiative forcing could be 
reduced by about 0.018–0.025 W m–2 by 2015. Over the 
next two decades this positive radiative forcing change is 
expected to be about 4–5% of that due to carbon dioxide 
emissions over the same period.
Global warming potentials (GWPs)
• The climate impact of a given mass of a halocarbon emitted 
to the atmosphere depends on its radiative properties and 
atmospheric lifetime. The two can be combined to compute 
the global warming potential (GWP), which is a proxy for 
the climate effect of a gas relative to the emission of a pulse 
of an equal mass of CO2. Multiplying emissions of a gas by 
its GWP gives the CO2-equivalent emission of that gas over 
a given time horizon.
• The GWP value of a gas is subject to change as better 
estimates of the radiative forcing and the lifetime associated 
with the gas or with the reference gas (CO2) become 
available. The GWP values (over 100 years) recommended 
in this report (Table 2.6) have been modiﬁed, depending on 
the gas, by –16% to +51%, compared with values reported 
in IPCC (1996), which were adopted by the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for 
use in national emission inventories. Some of these changes 
have already been reported in IPCC (2001). 
• HFC-23 is a byproduct of the manufacturing of HCFC-22 
and has a substantial radiative efﬁciency. Because of its 
long lifetime (270 years) its GWP is the largest of the HFCs, 
at 14,310 for a 100-year time horizon.
Degradation products
• The intermediate degradation products of most long-
lived CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs have shorter lifetimes than 
the source gases, and therefore have lower atmospheric 
concentrations and smaller radiative forcing. Intermediate 
products and ﬁnal products are removed from the atmosphere 
via deposition and washout processes and may accumulate 
in oceans, lakes and other reservoirs.
• Triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) is a persistent degradation 
product of some HFCs and HCFCs, with yields that are 
known from laboratory studies. TFA is removed from the 
atmosphere mainly by wet deposition. TFA is toxic to 
some aquatic life forms at concentrations at concentrations 
approaching 1 mg L–1. Current observations show that the 
typical concentration of TFA in the oceans is 0.2 µg L–1, but 
concentrations as high as 40 µg L–1 have been observed in 
the Dead Sea and Nevada lakes.
• New studies based on measured concentrations of TFA in sea 
water provide stronger evidence that the cumulative source 
of TFA from the degradation of HFCs is smaller than natural 
sources, which, however, have not been fully identiﬁed. The 
available environmental risk assessment and monitoring data 
indicate that the source of TFA from the degradation of HFCs 
is not expected to result in environmental concentrations 
capable of signiﬁcant ecosystem damage.
Air-quality effects
• HFCs, PFCs, other replacement gases such as organic 
compounds, and their degradation intermediates are not 
expected to have a signiﬁcant effect on global concentrations 
of OH radicals (which essentially determine the tropospheric 
self-cleaning capacity), because global OH concentrations 
are much more strongly inﬂuenced by carbon monoxide, 
methane and natural hydrocarbons. 
• The local impact of hydrocarbon and ammonia substitutes 
for air-conditioning, refrigeration and foam-blowing 
applications can be estimated by comparing their anticipated 
emissions to local pollutant emissions from all sources. 
Small but not negligible impacts could occur near highly 
localized emission sources. However, even small impacts 
may be of some concern in urban areas that currently fail to 
meet air quality standards.

Chapter 2: Chemical and Radiative Effects of Halocarbons and Their Replacement Compounds
137
2.1 
Introduction
The depletion of ozone in the stratosphere and the radiative 
forcing of climate change are caused by different processes. 
Chlorine and bromine released from chloroﬂuorocarbons 
(CFCs), halons and other halogen-containing species emitted in 
the last few decades are primarily responsible for the depletion 
of the ozone layer in the stratosphere. Anthropogenic emissions 
of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other green-
house gases are, together with aerosols, the main contributors 
to the change in radiative forcing of the climate system over 
the past 150 years. The possible adverse effects of both global 
environmental issues are being dealt with in different political 
arenas. The Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol are 
designed to protect the ozone layer, whereas the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 
the Kyoto Protocol play the same role for the climate system. 
However these two environmental issues interact both with 
respect to the trade-off in emissions of species as technology 
evolves, and with respect to the chemical and physical proc-
esses in the atmosphere. The chemical and physical processes 
of these interactions and their effects on ozone are discussed 
in Chapter 1. This chapter focuses on the atmospheric abun-
dance and radiative properties of CFCs, hydrochloroﬂuorocar-
bons (HCFCs), hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), perﬂuorocarbons 
(PFCs), and their possible replacements, as well as on their deg-
radation products, and on their effects on global, regional and 
local air quality.
 
The total amount, or burden, of a gas in the atmosphere is 
determined by the competing processes of its emission into and 
its removal from the atmosphere. Whereas emissions of most 
of the gases considered here are primarily a result of human 
activities, their rates of removal are largely determined by com-
plex natural processes that vary both spatially and temporally, 
and may differ from gas to gas. Rapid removal implies a short 
atmospheric lifetime, whereas slow removal and therefore a 
longer lifetime means that a given emission rate will result in a 
larger atmospheric burden. The concept of the atmospheric life-
time of a gas, which summarizes its destruction patterns in the 
atmosphere, is therefore central to understanding its atmospher-
ic accumulation. Section 2.2 discusses atmospheric lifetimes, 
how they are calculated, their inﬂuence on the global distribu-
tion of halocarbons, and their use in evaluating the effects of 
various species on the ozone layer and climate change under 
different future scenarios. Section 2.3 discusses the observed 
atmospheric abundance of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs, as 
well as emissions derived from these observations. Section 2.4 
discusses the decomposition products (e.g., triﬂuoroacetic acid, 
TFA) of these species and their possible effects on ecosystems.
 
Halocarbons, as well as carbon dioxide and water vapour, are 
greenhouse gases; that is, they allow incoming solar shortwave 
radiation to reach the Earth’s surface, while absorbing outgoing 
longwave radiation. The radiative forcing of a gas quantiﬁes its 
ability to perturb the Earth’s radiative energy budget, and can 
be either positive (warming) or negative (cooling). The global 
warming potential (GWP) is an index used to compare the cli-
mate impact of a pulse emission of a greenhouse gas, over time, 
relative to the same mass emission of carbon dioxide. Radiative 
forcings and GWPs are discussed in Section 2.5. The concen-
trations of emitted species and their degradation products de-
termine to a large extent their atmospheric impacts. Some of 
these concentrations are currently low but might increase in the 
future to levels that could cause environmental impacts. 
 
Some of the species being considered as replacements for 
ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), in particular hydrocarbons 
(HCs) and ammonia (NH3), are known to cause deterioration of 
tropospheric air quality in urban and industrialized continen-
tal areas, are involved in regulation of acidity and precipitation 
(ammonia), and could perturb the general self-cleaning (oxidiz-
ing) capacity of the global troposphere. These issues are con-
sidered in Section 2.6, where potential increments in reactivity 
from the replacement compounds are compared with the reac-
tivity of current emissions from other sources. 
2.2 
Atmospheric lifetimes and removal processes
2.2.1 
 Calculation of atmospheric lifetimes of 
halocarbons and replacement compounds
To evaluate the environmental impact of a given gas molecule, 
one needs to know, ﬁrst, how long it remains in the atmosphere. 
CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, hydroﬂuoroethers (HFEs), HCs 
and other replacement species for ODSs are chemically trans-
formed or physically removed from the atmosphere after their 
release. Known sinks for halocarbons and replacement gases 
include photolysis; reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH), 
the electronically excited atomic oxygen (O(1D)) and atomic 
chlorine (Cl); uptake in oceanic surface waters through dissolu-
tion; chemical and biological degradation processes; biological 
degradation in soils; and possibly surface reactions on minerals. 
For other trace gases, such as NH3, uptake by aerosols, cloud 
removal, aqueous-phase chemistry, and surface deposition also 
provide important sink processes. A schematic of the various 
removal processes affecting the atmospheric concentration of 
the considered species is provided in Figure 2.1. 
 
Individual removal processes have various impacts on differ-
ent gases in different regions of the atmosphere. The dominant 
process (the one with the fastest removal rate) controls the local 
loss of a gas. For example, reaction with OH is the dominant re-
moval process for many hydrogenated halocarbons in both the 
troposphere and stratosphere. For those same gases, reactions 
with O(1D) and Cl play a large role only in the stratosphere. The 
determination of the spatial distribution of the sink strength of a 
trace gas is of interest because it is relevant to both the calcula-
tion of the atmospheric lifetime and the environmental impact 
of the substance. The lifetimes of atmospheric trace gases have 
been recently re-assessed by the IPCC (2001, Chapter 4) and by 
the WMO Scientiﬁc Assessment of Ozone Depletion (WMO, 
2003, Chapter 1). Below is an updated summary of key features 
and methods used to determine the lifetimes.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
For a given trace gas, each relevant sink process, such as pho-
todissociation or oxidation by OH, contributes to the additive 
ﬁrst-order total loss frequency, l, which is variable in space and 
time. A local lifetime τlocal can be deﬁned as the inverse of l 
evaluated at a point in space (x, y, z) and time (t):
τlocal = 1/l(x, y, z, t)  
 
(2.1)
The global instantaneous atmospheric lifetime of the gas is ob-
tained by integrating l over the considered atmospheric domain. 
The integral must be weighted by the distribution of the trace 
gas on which the sink processes act. If C(x, y, z, t) is the distri-
bution of the trace gas , then the global instantaneous lifetime 
derived from the budget can be deﬁned as:
τglobal = ∫ C dv / ∫ C l dv

where dv is an atmospheric volume element. This expression 
can be averaged over a year to determine the global and annu-
ally averaged lifetime. The sinks that dominate the atmospheric 
lifetime are those that have signiﬁcant strength on a mass or 
molecule basis, that is, where loss frequency and atmospheric 
abundance are correlated. Because the total loss frequency l is 
the sum of the individual sink-process frequencies, τglobal can 
also be expressed in terms of process lifetimes:
1/τglobal = 1/τtropospheric OH + 1/τphotolysis + 1/τocean 
             + 1/τscavenging + 1/τother processes  
(2.3)
It is convenient to consider lifetime with respect to individual 
sink processes limited to speciﬁc regions, for example, reaction 
with OH in the troposphere. However, the associated burden 
must always be global and include all communicating reservoirs 
in order for Equation (2.3) to remain valid. In Equation (2.2) the 
numerator is therefore integrated over the whole atmospheric 
domain and the denominator is integrated over the domain in

which the individual sink process is considered. In the case of 
τtropospheric OH, the convention is that integration is performed over 
the tropospheric domain. The use of different domains or dif-
ferent deﬁnitions for the troposphere can lead to differences of 
10% in the calculated value (Lawrence et al., 2001).
 
A more detailed discussion of lifetimes is given in Box 2.1; 
the reader is referred to the cited literature for further informa-
tion.
Box 2.1. Global atmospheric, steady-state and perturbation lifetimes
The conservation equation of a given trace gas in the atmosphere is given by:
 
dB(t)/dt = E(t) – L(B, t) 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(1)
where the time evolution of the burden, B(t) [kg] = ∫ C dv, is given by the emissions, E(t) [kg s–1], minus the loss, L(B, t) [kg 
s–1] = ∫ C l dv. The emission is an external parameter. The loss of the gas may depend on its concentration as well as that of 
other gases. The global instantaneous atmospheric lifetime (also called ‘burden lifetime’ or ‘turnover lifetime’), deﬁned in 
Equation (2.2), is given by the ratio τglobal = B(t)/L(t). If this quantity is constant in time, then the conservation equation takes 
on a much simpler form:
       dB(t)/dt = E(t) – B(t)/τglobal 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(2)
Equation (2) is for instance valid for a gas whose local chemical lifetime is constant in space and time, such as the noble gas 
radon (Rn), whose lifetime is ﬁxed by the rate of its radioactive disintegration. In such a case the mean atmospheric lifetime 
equals the local lifetime: the lifetime that relates source strength to global burden is exactly the decay time of a perturbation. 
The global atmospheric lifetime characterizes the time to achieve an e-fold (63.2%, see ‘lifetime’ in glossary) decrease of the 
global atmospheric burden. Unfortunately, τglobal is truly a constant only in very limited circumstances because both C and l 
change with time. Note that when in steady-state (i.e., with unchanging burden), Equation (1) implies that the source strength 
is equal to the sink strength. In this case, the steady-state lifetime (τSS
global) is a scale factor relating constant emissions to the 
steady-state burden of a gas (BSS = τSS
global E). 
In the case that the loss rate depends on the burden, Equation (2) must be modiﬁed. In general, a more rigorous (but still 
approximate) solution can be achieved by linearizing the problem. The perturbation or pulse decay lifetime (τpert) is deﬁned 
simply as:
 
1/τpert = ∂L(B, t)/∂B 
  
 
 
 
 
 
(3)
and the correct form of the conservation equation is (Prather, 2002):
   dΔB(t)/dt = ΔΕ(t) – ΔB(t)/τpert 
(4)
where ΔB(t) is the perturbation to the steady-state background B(t) and ΔΕ(t) is an emission perturbation (pulse or constant 
increment). Equation (4) is particularly useful for determining how a one-time pulse emission may decay with time, which is 
a quantity needed for GWP calculation. For some gases, the perturbation lifetime is considerably different from the steady-
state lifetime (i.e., the lifetime that relates source strength to steady-state global burden is not exactly equal to the decay time 
of a perturbation). For example, if the abundance of CH4 is increased above its present-day value by a one-time emission, the 
time it would take for CH4 to decay back to its background value is longer than its global unperturbed atmospheric lifetime. 
This occurs because the added CH4 causes a suppression of OH, which in turn increases the background abundance of CH4. 
Such feedbacks cause the time scale of a perturbation (τpert) to differ from the steady-state lifetime (τSS
global). In the limit of 
small perturbations, the relation between the perturbation lifetime of a gas and its global atmospheric lifetime can be derived 
from the simple budget relationship τpert = τSS
global/(1 – f), where f = dln(τglobal
SS)/dln(B) is the sensitivity coefﬁcient (without a 
feedback on lifetime, f = 0 and τpert is identical to τSS
global). The feedback of CH4 on tropospheric OH and its own lifetime has 
been re-evaluated with contemporary global chemical-transport models (CTMs) as part of an IPCC intercomparison exercise 
(IPCC, 2001, Chapter 4). The calculated OH feedback, dln(OH)/dln(CH4), was consistent among the models, indicating that 
tropospheric OH abundances decline by 0.32% for every 1% increase in CH4. When other loss processes for CH4 (loss to 
stratosphere, soil uptake) were included, the feedback factor reduced to 0.28 and the ratio τpert/τSS
global was 1.4. For a single 
pulse, this 40% increase in the integrated effect of a CH4 perturbation does not translate to a 40% larger burden in the per-

Figure 2.2 shows the time evolution of the remaining fraction of 
several constituents in the atmosphere after their pulse emission 
at time t = 0. This ﬁgure illustrates the impact of the lifetime of 
the constituent on the decay of the perturbation. The half-life 
is the time required to remove 50% of the initial mass injected 
and the e-fold time is the time required to remove 63.2%. As 
mentioned earlier, a pulse emission of most gases into the at-
mosphere decays on a range of time scales until atmospheric 
transport and chemistry redistribute the gas into its longest-
lived decay pattern. Most of this adjustment occurs within 1 to 
2 years as the gas mixes throughout the atmosphere. The ﬁnal 
e-fold decay occurs on a time scale very close, but not exactly 
equal, to the steady-state lifetime used to prepare Figure 2.2 and 
Table 2.6. Note that the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere 
cannot be adequately described by a single, simple exponential 
lifetime (see IPCC, 1994, and IPCC, 2001, for a discussion). 
 
The general applicability of atmospheric lifetimes breaks 
down for gases and pollutants whose chemical losses or local 
lifetimes vary in space and time and the average duration of 
the lifetimes is weeks rather than years or months. For these 
gases the value of the global atmospheric lifetime is not unique 
and depends on the location (and season) and the magnitude of 
the emission (see Box 2.1). The majority of halogen-contain-
ing species and ODS-replacement species considered here have 
atmospheric lifetimes greater than two years, much longer than 
tropospheric mixing times; hence their lifetimes are not signiﬁ-
cantly altered by the location of sources within the troposphere. 
When lifetimes are reported for gases in Table 2.6, it is assumed 
that the gases are uniformly mixed throughout the troposphere. 
This assumption is less accurate for gases with lifetimes shorter 
than one year. For such short-lived gases (e.g., HCs, NH3), re-
ported values for a single global lifetime, ozone depletion po-
tential (ODP) or GWP become inappropriate.
2.2.2 
Oxidation by OH in the troposphere
The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the primary cleansing agent of the 
lower atmosphere, and in particular it provides the dominant 
sink for HCFCs, HFCs, HCs and many chlorinated hydrocar-
bons. The steady-state lifetimes of these trace gases are deter-
mined by the morphology of the species’ distribution, the kinet-
ics of the reaction with OH, and the OH distribution. The local 
abundance of OH is mainly controlled by the local abundances 
of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), CO, CH4 and higher hy-
drocarbons, O3, and water vapour, as well as by the intensity of 
solar ultraviolet radiation. The primary source of tropospheric 
OH is a pair of reactions that start with the photodissociation of 
O3 by solar ultraviolet radiation:
O3 + hν → O(1D) + O2  
 
[2.1]
O(1D) + H2O → OH + OH  
 
[2.2]
turbation but rather to a lengthening of the duration of the perturbation. If the increased emissions are maintained to steady-
state, then the 40% increase does translate to a larger burden (Isaksen and Hov, 1987). 
The pulse lifetime is the lifetime that should be used in the GWP calculation (in particular in the case of CH4). For the long-
lived halocarbons, l is approximately constant in time and C can be approximated by the steady-state distribution in order 
to calculate the steady-state lifetimes reported in Table 2.6. In this case, Equation (2) is approximately valid and the decay 
lifetime of a pulse is taken to be the same as the steady-state global atmospheric lifetime.
In the case of a constant increment in emissions, at steady-state, Equation (4) shows that steady-state lifetime of the pertur-
bation (τSS
pert) is a scaling factor relating the steady-state perturbation burden (ΔBSS) to the change in emission (ΔBSS = τSS
pert 
ΔE). Furthermore, Prather (1996, 2002) has also shown that the integrated atmospheric abundance following a single pulse 
emission is equal to the product of the amount emitted and the perturbation steady-state lifetime for that emission pattern. 
The steady-state lifetime of the perturbation is then a scaling factor relating the emission pulse to the time-integrated burden 
of that pulse.
Lifetimes can be determined using global tropospheric models by simulating the injection of a pulse of a given gas and 
watching the decay of this added amount. This decay can be represented by a sum of exponential functions, each with its own 
decay time. These exponential functions are the chemical modes of the linearized chemistry-transport equations of a global 
model (Prather, 1996). In the case of a CH4 addition, the longest-lived mode has an e-fold time of 12 years, which is very 
close to the steady-state perturbation lifetime of CH4 and carries most of the added burden. In the case of a carbon monoxide 
(CO), HCFCs or HCs addition, this mode is also excited, but at a much-reduced amplitude, which depends on the amount 
of gas added (Prather, 1996; Daniel and Solomon, 1998). The pulse of added CO, HCFCs or HCs causes a build-up of CH4 
while the added burden of the gas persists, by causing the concentration of OH to decrease and thus the lifetime of CH4 to 
increase temporarily. After the initial period deﬁned by the photochemical lifetime of the injected trace gas, this built-up CH4 
decays in the same manner as would a direct pulse of CH4. Thus, changes in the emissions of short-lived gases can generate 
long-lived perturbations, a result which is also shown in global models (Wild et al., 2001; Derwent et al., 2001).

141
In polluted regions and in the upper troposphere, photodissocia-
tion of other trace gases, such as peroxides, acetone and formal-
dehyde (Singh et al., 1995; Arnold et al., 1997), may provide 
the dominant source of OH (e.g., Folkins et al., 1997; Prather 
and Jacob, 1997; Müller and Brasseur, 1999; Wennberg et al., 
1998). OH reacts with many atmospheric trace gases, in most 
cases as the ﬁrst and rate-determining step of a reaction chain 
that leads to more or less complete oxidation of the compound. 
These chains often lead to formation of an HO2 radical, which 
then reacts with O3 or NO to recycle back to OH. Tropospheric 
OH and HO2 are lost through radical-radical reactions that lead 
to the formation of peroxides, or by reaction with NO2 to form 
HNO3. The sources and sinks of OH involve most of the fast 
photochemistry of the troposphere. 
 
The global distribution of OH radicals cannot be observed 
directly because of the difﬁculty in measuring its small concen-
trations (of about 106 OH molecules per cm3 on average dur-
ing daylight in the lower free troposphere) and because of high 
variability of OH with geographical location, time of day and 
season. However, indirect estimates of the average OH concen-
tration can be obtained from observations of atmospheric con-
centrations of trace gases, such methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), 
that are removed mostly by reaction with OH (with rate con-
stants known from laboratory studies) and whose emission his-
tory is relatively well known. The lifetime of CH3CCl3 is often 
used as a reference number to derive the lifetime of other spe-
cies (see Section 2.2.5) and, by convention, provides a measure 
of the global OH burden. Observations over a long time (years 
to decades) can provide estimates of long-term OH trends that 
would change the lifetimes, ODPs and GWPs of some halo-
carbons, and increase or decrease their impacts relative to the 
current values. 
 
There is an ongoing debate in the literature about the emis-
sions and lifetime of CH3CCl3 and hence on the deduced vari-
ability of OH concentrations over the last 20 years. Prinn et al. 
(2001) analyzed a 22-year record of global CH3CCl3 measure-
ments and emission estimates and suggested that the trend in 
global OH over that period was –0.66 ± 0.57% yr–1. Prinn and 
Huang (2001) analyzed the record only from 1978 to 1993 and 
deduced a trend of +0.3% yr–1 using the same emissions as Krol 
et al. (1998). These results through 1993 are essentially consist-
ent with the conclusions of Krol et al. (1998, 2001), who used 
the same measurements and emission record but an independ-
ent calculation technique to infer a trend of +0.46 ± 0.6% yr–1 
between 1978 and 1994. However, Prinn et al. (2001) inferred 
a larger interannual and inter-decadal variability in global OH 
than Krol et al. (1998, 2001). Prinn et al. (2001) also inferred 
that OH concentrations in the late 1990s were lower than 
those in the late 1970s to early 1980s, in agreement with the 
longer CH3CCl3 lifetime reported by Montzka et al. (2000) for 
1998–1999 relative to the Prinn et al. (2001) value for the full-
period average. A recent study by Krol and Lelieveld (2003) 
indicated a larger variation of OH of +12% during 1978–1990, 
followed by a decrease slightly larger than 12% in the decade 
1991–2000. Over the entire 1978–2000 period, the study found 
that the overall change was close to zero. 
 
As discussed by Prinn et al. (1995, 2001), Krol and Lelieveld 
(2003) and Krol et al. (2003), inferences regarding CH3CCl3 
lifetimes or trends in OH are sensitive to errors in the absolute 
magnitude of estimated emissions and to the estimates of other 
sinks (stratospheric loss, ocean sink). The errors on emissions 
could be signiﬁcant and enhanced during the late 1990s because 
the annual emissions of CH3CCl3 were dropping precipitously 
at the time. These difﬁculties in the use of CH3CCl3 to infer the 
trend in OH have also been pointed out by Jöckel et al. (2003), 
who suggested the use of other dedicated tracers to estimate the 
global OH distribution. 
 
The ﬂuctuations in global OH derived from CH3CCl3 meas-
urements are in conﬂict with observed CH4 growth rates and 
with model calculations. Karlsdottir and Isaksen (2000) and 
Dentener et al. (2003a,b) present multi-dimensional model re-
sults for the period 1980–1996 and 1979–1993, respectively. 
These studies produce increases in mean global tropospheric 
OH levels of respectively 0.41% yr–1 and 0.25% yr–1 over the 
considered periods. These changes are driven largely by in-
creases in low-latitude emissions of NOx and CO, in the case 
of Karlsdottir and Isaksen (2000), and also by changes in strat-
ospheric ozone and meteorological variability, in the case of 
Dentener et al. (2003a,b). The modelling study by Warwick et 
al. (2002) also stressed the importance of meteorological inter-
annual variability on global OH and on the growth rate of CH4 
in the atmosphere. Wang et al. (2004) also derived a positive 
trend in OH of +0.63% yr–1 over the period 1988–1997. Their 
calculated trend in OH is primarily associated with the negative 
trend in overhead column ozone. We note however that their 
forward simulations did not account for the interannual vari-

ability of all the variables that affect OH and were conditional 
on their assumed emissions being correct.
 
Because of its dependence on CH4 and other pollutants, the 
concentration of tropospheric OH is likely to have changed 
since the pre-industrial era and is expected to change in the 
future. Pre-industrial OH is likely to have been different than 
it is today, but because of the counteracting effects of higher 
concentrations of CO and CH4 (which decrease OH) and higher 
concentrations of NOx and O3 (which increase OH) there is lit-
tle consensus on the magnitude or even the sign of this change. 
Several model studies have suggested that weighted global 
mean OH has decreased from pre-industrial time to the present 
day by less than 10% (Berntsen et al., 1997; Wang and Jacob, 
1998; Shindell et al., 2001; Lelieveld et al., 2002). Other studies 
have reported larger decreases in global OH of 16% (Mickley 
et al., 1999) and 33% (Hauglustaine and Brasseur, 2001). The 
model study by Lelieveld et al. (2002) suggests that during the 
past century OH concentrations decreased substantially in the 
marine troposphere by reaction with CH4 and CO; however, on 
a global scale, this decrease has been offset by an increase over 
the continents associated with large emissions of NOx. 
 
As for future changes in OH, the IPCC (2001, Chapter 
4) used scenarios reported in the IPCC Special Report on 
Emissions Scenarios (SRES, IPCC, 2000) and a comparison 
of results from 14 models to predict that global OH could de-
crease by 10% to 18% by 2100 for ﬁve emission scenarios, and 
increase by 5% for one scenario that assumed large decreases 
in CH4 and other ozone precursor emissions. Based on a dif-
ferent emission scenario Wang and Prinn (1999) projected a 
decrease in OH concentrations of 16 ± 3%. In addition to emis-
sion changes, future increases in direct and indirect green-
house gases could also induce changes in OH through direct 
participation in OH-controlling chemistry, indirectly through 
stratospheric ozone changes that could change solar ultraviolet 
in the troposphere, and potentially through climate change ef-
fects on biogenic emissions, temperature, humidity and clouds. 
Changes in tropospheric water could have important chemi-
cal repercussions, because the reaction between water vapour 
and electronically excited oxygen atoms constitutes the major 
source of tropospheric OH (Reaction [2.1]). So in a warmer and 
potentially wetter climate, the abundance of OH is expected to 
increase.
2.2.3 
Removal processes in the stratosphere
Stratospheric in situ sinks for halocarbons and ODS replace-
ments include photolysis and homogeneous gas-phase reactions 
with OH, Cl and O(1D). Because about 90% of the burden of 
well-mixed gases resides in the troposphere, stratospheric re-
moval does not contribute much to the atmospheric lifetimes of 
gases that are removed efﬁciently in the troposphere. For most 
of the HCFCs and HFCs considered in this report, stratospheric 
removal typically accounts for less than 10% of the total loss. 
However, stratospheric removal is important for determining the 
spatial distributions of a source gas and its degradation products 
in the stratosphere. These distributions depend on the competi-
tion between local photochemical removal processes and the 
transport processes that carry the material from the entry point 
(mainly at the tropical tropopause) to the upper stratosphere and 
the extra-tropical lower stratosphere. Observations show that 
the stratospheric mixing ratios of source gases decrease with 
altitude and can be described at steady-state by a local exponen-
tial scale height at each latitude. Theoretical calculations show 
that the local scale height is proportional to the square root of 
the local lifetime (Ehhalt et al., 1998).
 
Previous studies (Hansen et al., 1997; Christidis et al., 1997; 
Jain et al., 2000) showed that depending on the values of the as-
sumed scale height in the stratosphere, the calculated radiative 
forcing for CFC-11 can differ by as much as 30%. Thus, accu-
rate determination of the GWP of a gas also requires knowing 
its scale height in the stratosphere. Again, observations will be 
useful for verifying model-calculated scale heights. Other diag-
nostics, such as the age of air (see glossary), will improve our 
conﬁdence in the models’ ability to simulate the transport in the 
atmosphere and accurately predict the scale heights appropriate 
for radiative forcing calculations.
 
Perﬂuorinated compounds, such as PFCs, SF6 and SF5CF3, 
have limited use as ODS replacements is limited (see Chapter 
10). The carbon-ﬂuorine bond is remarkably strong and resist-
ant to chemical attack. Atmospheric removal processes for 
PFCs are extremely slow and these compounds have lifetimes 
measured in thousands of years. Photolysis at short wave-
lengths (e.g., Lyman-α at 121.6 nm in the mesosphere) was 
ﬁrst suggested to be a possible degradation pathway for CF4 
(Cicerone, 1979). Other possible reactions with O(1D), H atoms 
and OH radicals, and combustion in high-temperature systems 
(e.g., incinerators, engines) were considered (Ravishankara 
et al., 1993). Reactions with electrons in the mesosphere and 
with ions were further considered by Morris et al. (1995), and 
a review of the importance of the different processes has been 
carried out (WMO, 1995). More recently, the degradation proc-
esses of SF5CF3 were studied (Takahashi et al., 2002). The rate 
constant for its reaction with OH was found to be less than 10–18 
cm3 molecule–1 s–1 and can be neglected. The main degradation 
process for CF4 and C2F6 is probably the reaction with O+ in the 
mesosphere, but destruction in high-temperature combustion 
systems remains the principal near-surface removal process. In 
the case of c-C4F8, SF6 and SF5CF3, the main degradation proc-
esses are reaction with electrons and photolysis, whereas C6F14 
degradation would mainly occur by photolysis at 121.6 nm. 
2.2.4 
Other sinks
For several species other sink processes are also important in 
determining their global lifetime in the atmosphere. One such 
process is wet deposition (scavenging by atmospheric hydro-
meteors including cloud and fog drops, rain and snow), which 
is an important sink for NH3. In general, scavenging by large-
scale and convective precipitation has the potential to limit the 
upward transport of gases and aerosols from source regions.

Chapter 2: Chemical and Radiative Effects of Halocarbons and Their Replacement Compounds
143
This effect is largely controlled by the solubility of a species 
in water and its uptake in ice. Crutzen and Lawrence (2000) 
noted that the solubilities of most of the HCFCs, HFCs and HCs 
considered in this chapter are too low for signiﬁcant scavenging 
to occur. However, because NH3 is largely removed by liquid-
phase scavenging at pH lower than about 7, its lifetime is con-
trolled by uptake on aerosol and cloud drops.
 
Irreversible deposition is facilitated by the dynamics of 
tropospheric mixing, which expose tropospheric air to contact 
with the surface. Irreversible deposition can occur through or-
ganisms in ocean surface waters that can both consume and 
produce halocarbons; chemical degradation of dissolved halo-
carbons through hydrolysis; and physical dissolution of halocar-
bons into ocean waters, which does not represent a signiﬁcant 
sink for most halocarbons. These processes are highly variable 
in the ocean, and depend on physical processes of the ocean 
mixed layer, temperature, productivity, surface saturation and 
other variables. Determining a net global sink through obser-
vation is a difﬁcult task. Yvon-Lewis and Butler (2002) have 
constructed a high-resolution model of the ocean surface layer, 
which included its interaction with the atmosphere, and physi-
cal, chemical and biological ocean processes. They examined 
ocean uptake for a range of halocarbons, using known solubili-
ties and chemical and biological degradation rates. Their results 
show that lifetimes of atmospheric HCFCs and HFCs with re-
spect to hydrolysis in sea water are very long, and range from 
hundreds to thousands of years. Therefore, they found that for 
most HFCs and HCFCs the ocean sink was insigniﬁcant com-
pared with in situ atmospheric sinks. However, both atmospher-
ic CH3CCl3 and CCl4 have shorter (and coincidentally the same) 
oceanic-loss lifetimes of 94 years, which must be included in 
determining the total lifetimes of these compounds.
 
Dry deposition, which is the transfer of trace gases and 
aerosols from the atmosphere onto surfaces in the absence of 
precipitation, is also important to consider for some species, 
particularly NH3. Dry deposition is governed by the level of 
turbulence in the atmosphere, the solubility and reactivity of the 
species, and the nature of the surface itself.
2.2.5 
Halogenated trace gas steady-state lifetimes
The steady-state lifetimes used in this report and reported in 
Table 2.6 are taken mainly from the work of WMO (2003, 
Chapter 1). Chemical reaction coefﬁcients and photodissocia-
tion rates used by WMO (2003, Chapter 1) to calculate atmos-
pheric lifetimes for gases destroyed by tropospheric OH are 
mainly from the latest NASA/JPL evaluations (Sander et al., 
2000, 2003). These rate coefﬁcients are sensitive to atmospher-
ic temperature and can be signiﬁcantly faster near the surface 
than in the upper troposphere. The global mean abundance of 
OH cannot be directly measured, but a weighted average of the 
OH sink for certain synthetic trace gases (whose budgets are 
well established and whose total atmospheric sinks are essen-
tially controlled by OH) can be derived. The ratio of the atmos-
pheric lifetimes against tropospheric OH loss for a gas is scaled 
to that of CH3CCl3 by the inverse ratio of their OH reaction 
rate coefﬁcients at an appropriate scaling temperature of 272 
K (Spivakovsky et al., 2000; WMO, 2003, Chapter 1; IPCC, 
2001, Chapter 4). Stratospheric losses for all gases considered 
by WMO (2003, Chapter 1) were taken from published values 
(WMO, 1999, Chapters 1 and 2; Ko et al., 1999) or calculated 
as 8% of the tropospheric loss (with a minimum lifetime of 30 
years). 
 
WMO (2003, Chapter 1) used Equation (2.3) to determine 
that the value of τOH for CH3CCl3 is 6.1 years, by using the fol-
lowing values for the other components of the equation: τglobal 
(= 5.0 yr) was inferred from direct observations of CH3CCl3 and 
estimates of emissions; τphotolysis (= 38–41 yr) arises from loss in 
the stratosphere and was inferred from observed stratospheric 
correlations among CH3CCl3, CFC-11 and the observed strat-
ospheric age of the air mass; τocean (= 94 yr) was derived from a 
model of the oceanic loss process and has already been used by 
WMO (2003, Chapter 1); and τothers was taken to be zero.

Concentrations of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and 
PFCs
2.3.1 
Measurements of surface concentrations and 
growth rates 
Observations of concentrations of several halocarbons (CFCs, 
HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs) in surface air have been made by glo-
bal networks (Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment, ALE; Global 
Atmospheric Gases Experiment, GAGE; Advanced GAGE, 
AGAGE; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory, NOAA/
CMDL; and University of California at Irvine, UCI) and as 
atmospheric columns (Network for Detection of Stratospheric 
Change, NDSC). The observed concentrations are usually ex-
pressed as mole fractions: as ppt, parts in 1012 (parts per tril-
lion), or ppb, parts in 109 (parts per billion).
 
Tropospheric concentrations and their growth rates were 
given by WMO (2003, Chapter 1, Tables 1-1 and 1-12) for a 
range of halocarbons measured in global networks through 
2000. Readers are referred to WMO (2003, Chapter 1) for a 
more detailed discussion of the observed trends. This chapter 
provides in Table 2.1 data (with some exceptions) for concen-
trations through 2003 and for growth rates averaged over the 
period 2001–2003. Historical data are available on several web 
sites (e.g., NOAA/CMDL at http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/
index.html and AGAGE at http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ale_gage_
Agage/AGAGE) and are shown here in Figure 2.3.
 
Many of the species for which data are tabulated here and in 
WMO (2003, Chapter 1) are regulated in the Montreal Protocol. 
The concentrations of two of the more abundant CFCs, CFC-11 
and CFC-113, peaked around 1996 and have decreased since 
then. For CFC-12, the concentrations have continued increas-
ing up to 2002, but the rate of increase is now close to zero. The 
concentrations of the less abundant CFC-114 and CFC-115 (with 
lifetimes longer than 150 yr) are relatively stable at present. The

two most abundant halons, Halon-1211 and Halon-1301, are 
still increasing but at a reduced rate. The concentration of CCl4 
has declined since 1990 as a consequence of reduced emissions. 
The atmospheric abundance of CH3CCl3 has declined rapidly 
because of large reductions in its emissions and its relatively 
short lifetime. The three most abundant HCFCs, HCFC-22, 
HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b, increased signiﬁcantly during 
the 2000s (at a mean rate of between 4 and 8% yr–1), but the 
rates of increase for HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b have slowed 
somewhat from those in the 1990s. The concentration of SF6 is 
growing, but at a slightly reduced rate over the last few years, 
suggesting that its emissions may be slowing.
 
Uncertainties in the measurement of absolute concentra-
tions are largely associated with calibration procedures and are 
species dependent. Calibration differences between the differ-
ent reporting networks are of the order of 1–2% for CFC-11 and 
CFC-12, and slightly lower for CFC-113; <3% for CH3CCl3; 
3–4% for CCl4; 5% or less for HCFC-22, HCFC-141b and

HCFC-142b; 10–15% for Halon-1211; and 25% for Halon-
1301 (WMO, 2003, Chapter 1).
 
HFCs were developed as replacements for CFCs and have 
a relatively short emission history. Their concentrations are 
currently signiﬁcantly lower than those of the most abundant 
CFCs, but are increasing rapidly. HFC-134a and HFC-23 are 
the most abundant species, with HFC-134a growing most rap-
idly at a mean rate of almost 20% yr–1 since 2000. 
 
Observations of PFCs are sparse and growth rates are not re-
ported here. CF4 is by far the most abundant species in this group. 
About half of the current abundance of CF4 arises from alumin-
ium production and the electronics industry. Measurements of 
CF4 in ice cores have revealed a natural source, which accounts 
for the other half of current abundances (Harnisch et al., 1996). 
The level of SF6 continues to rise, at a rate of about 5% yr–1.
 
Further, the atmospheric histories of a group of halocarbons 
have been reconstructed from analyses of air trapped in ﬁrn, or 
snow above glaciers (Butler et al., 1999; Sturges et al., 2001; 
Sturrock et al., 2002; Trudinger et al., 2002). The results show 
that concentrations of CFCs, halons and HCFCs at the begin-
ning of the 20th century were generally less than 2% of the 
current concentrations.
2.3.2 
Deriving global emissions from observed 
concentrations and trends
Emissions of halocarbons can be inferred from observations 
of their concentrations in the atmosphere when their loss rates 
are accurately known. Such estimates can be used to validate 
and verify emission-inventory data produced by industries and 
reported by parties of international regulatory conventions. 
The atmospheric emissions of halocarbons estimated in emis-
sion inventories are based on compilations of global halocar-
bon production (AFEAS, 2004), sales into each end-use and 
the time schedule for atmospheric emission from each end-use 
(McCulloch et al., 2001, 2003). Uncertainties arise if the global 
production ﬁgures do not cover all manufacturing countries and 
if there are variations in the behaviour of the end-use categories. 
For some halocarbons, there are no global emission inventory 
estimates. Observed concentrations are often the only means 
of verifying halocarbon emission inventories and the emissions 
from the ‘banks’ of each halocarbon.
 
In principle, estimates of the emissions of halocarbons can 
be obtained from industrial production ﬁgures, provided that 
sufﬁcient information is available concerning the end-uses of 
halocarbons and the extent of the banking of the unreleased 
halocarbon. Industrial production data for the halocarbons have 
been compiled in the Alternative Fluorocarbons Environmental 
Acceptability Study (AFEAS, 2004). AFEAS compiles data for 
a halocarbon if three or more companies worldwide produced 
more than 1 kt yr–1 each of the halocarbon. These ﬁgures have 
been converted into time histories of global atmospheric re-
lease rates for CFC-11 (McCulloch et al., 2001), and for CFC-
12, HCFC-22 and HFC-134a (McCulloch et al., 2003). The 
Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) 
has included emissions of several HFCs and PFCs, and of SF6 
based on various industry estimates (Olivier and Berdowski, 
2001; Olivier, 2002; http://arch.rivm.nl/env/int/coredata/edgar/
index.html).
 
Global emissions based on AGAGE and CMDL data have 
been estimated using a 2-D 12-box model and an optimal 
linear least-squares Kalman ﬁlter. Emissions of HFC-134a, 
HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b over the period 1992–2000 
were estimated by Huang and Prinn (2002) using AGAGE and 
NOAA-CMDL measurements. They compared them to indus-
try (AFEAS) estimates and concluded that there are signiﬁcant 
differences for HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b, but not for HFC-
134a. Later O’Doherty et al. (2004) used AGAGE data and the 
same model to infer global emissions of the same species plus 
HCFC-22. They found a fair agreement between emission es-
timates based on consumption and on their measurements for 
HCFC-22, with the former exceeding the latter by about 10% 
during parts of the 1990s. Emissions for CFC-11, CFC-12, 
CFC-113, CCl4 and HCFC-22 have been computed from global 
observations and compared with industry estimates by Cunnold 
et al. (1997) and Prinn et al. (2000), with updates by WMO 
(2003, Chapter 1). The general conclusion was that emissions 
estimated in this way are with few exceptions consistent with 
expectations from the Montreal Protocol.
 
Estimation of the global emissions (E) from observed trends 
is based on Equation (2) in Box 2.1 rewritten below as:
E(t) = dB(t)/dt + B(t)/τSS
global 
 
(2.4)
where B is the global halocarbon burden and τSS
global is the 
steady-state lifetime from Table 2.6. The ﬁrst term on the 
right-hand side represents the trend in the global burden and 
the second term represents the decay in the global burden due 
to atmospheric loss processes. This approach is only valid for 
long-lived well-mixed gases, and it is subject to uncertainties. 
First, the estimation of a global burden (B(t) in the second term) 
from a limited number of surface observation stations is uncer-
tain because it involves variability in both the horizontal and 
the vertical distributions of the gases. Second, some of the es-
Figure 2.3. Global annually averaged tropospheric mole fractions. In situ abundances from AGAGE and CMDL (measured with the CATS 
or RITS gas chromatographs) and ﬂask samples from CMDL are included. The AGAGE abundances are global lower-troposphere averages 
processed through the AGAGE 12-box model (Prinn et al., 2000; updates provided by D. Cunnold). The CMDL abundances are area-weighted 
global means for the lower troposphere (from http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/index.html), estimated as 12-month averages centred around 1 
January each year (e.g., 2002.0 = 1 January 2002). CMDL data for 2003 are preliminary and will be subject to recalibration. The UCI data are 
based on samples at latitudes between 71°N and 47°S. The UEA data (HFC-23) are from Cape Grim, Tasmania, and are represented here by a ﬁt 
to a series of Legendre polynomials (up to third degree).

timates presented in this report are based on a 1-box model of 
the atmosphere, in which case the extrapolation from a limited 
number of surface observations to the global burden introduces 
some further uncertainty. Additional uncertainties in the esti-
mated emissions arise from the assumption that the loss can 
be approximated by B(t)/τSS
global and from uncertainties in the 
absolute calibration of the observations.
 
This method has been employed to infer global emissions 
in a range of studies. For example, Höhne and Harnisch (2002) 
found that the calculated emissions of HFC-134a were in good 
agreement with reported emissions in the 1990–1995 period, 
whereas the emissions inferred for SF6 were considerably 
lower than those reported to the UNFCCC. In a recent paper 
by Culbertson et al. (2004) the 1-box model was used to in-
fer emissions for several CF3-containing compounds, includ-
ing CFC-115, Halon-1301, HFC-23, HFC-143a and HFC-134a, 
using ﬂask samples from Oregon, Alaska and Antarctica. The 
emissions calculated in their study generally agreed well with 
emissions from other studies. They also provided ﬁrst estimates 
of emissions of some rarer gases, such as CFC-13 and C3F8. 
 
In Figures 2.3 and 2.4 we present the concentrations and 
inferred emissions of several species since 1990. We have used 
in situ data from AGAGE and CMDL, as well as ﬂask samples 
from, for example, CMDL. The inferred emissions are com-
pared with emissions from AFEAS and EDGAR when those 
were available. The range in the observation-based emissions 
in Figure 2.4 includes some but not all of the uncertainties dis-
cussed earlier in this section.
 
In general the results presented in Figures 2.3 and 2.4 con-
ﬁrm the ﬁndings of previous studies. The global emission esti-
mates presented in Figure 2.4 show a clear downward trend for 
most compounds regulated by the Montreal Protocol. Inferred 
emissions for the HCFCs have been rising strongly since 1990 
and those of HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b have levelled off 
from 2000 onwards. However, emissions of the HFCs have 
been growing in most cases, most noticeably for HFC-134a, 
HFC-125 and HFC-152a. In contrast to the other HFCs, emis-
sions of HFC-23 began several decades before the others (Oram 
et al., 1998) because of its release as a byproduct of HCFC-22 
production. Its emissions have increased slightly over the last 
decade.
 
Since the mid-1990s, the emissions derived for CFC-11 and 
CFC-12 (Figure 2.4) have been larger than the best estimate 
of emissions based on global inventories. The inferred emis-
sions for CFC-12 have decreased strongly, but have gradually 
become larger than the inventories since the mid-1990s. The 
inferred emissions of HFC-134a, which have increased strongly 
since the early 1990s, were in good agreement with the inven-
tories of EDGAR and AFEAS until 2000, after which they were 
somewhat lower than the AFEAS values.
2.3.3 
Deriving regional emissions from observed 
concentrations
Formally, the application of halocarbon observations to the de-
termination of regional emissions is an inverse problem. Some 
investigations have treated the problem in this way and used 
observations to constrain global or regional sources or sinks. In 
other approaches, the problem has been solved in a direct man-
ner from emissions to mixing ratios, and iteration or extrapo-
lation has been used to work back to the emissions estimated 
to support and explain the observations. Both approaches have 
been applied to halocarbons and both have advantages and dis-
advantages. The focus here is primarily on studies that directly 
answer questions concerning the regional emissions of halocar-
bons and their replacements, rather than on documenting the 
wide range of inverse methods available. The aim is to provide 
veriﬁcation or validation of the available emission inventories.
 
High-frequency in situ observations of the anthropogenic 
halocarbons and greenhouse gases have been made continuous-
ly at the Adrigole and Mace Head Atmospheric Observatories 
on the Atlantic Ocean coast of Ireland since 1987 as part of the 
ALE/GAGE/AGAGE programmes. To obtain global baseline 
trends, the European regional pollution events, which affect the 
Mace Head site about 30% of the time, were removed from 
the data records (Prinn et al., 2000). Prather (1985) used the 
polluted data, with its short time-scale variations over 1- to 10-
day periods, to determine the relative magnitudes of European 
continental sources of halocarbons and to quantify previously 
unrecognized European sources of trace gases such as nitrous 
oxide (N2O) and CCl4.
 
The European emission source strengths estimated to sup-
port the ALE/GAGE/AGAGE observations at Mace Head have 
been determined initially using a simple long-range transport 
model (Simmonds et al., 1996) and more recently a Lagrangian 
dispersion model (Ryall et al., 2001), and are presented in Table 
2.2. These studies have demonstrated that although the releases 
of CFC-11 and CFC-12 have been dramatically reduced, by 
factors of at least 20, European emissions are still continu-
ing at readily detectable and non-negligible levels. Table 2.2 
also provides cogent evidence of the phase-out of the emis-
sions of CCl4, CH3CCl3 and CFC-113 under the provisions of 
the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments during the 1990s. 
The contributions of source regions to the observations at Mace 
Head fall off rapidly to the east and south, with contributions 
from the eastern Mediterranean being more than three orders of 
Figure 2.4. Global annual emissions (in kt yr–1) inferred from the mole fractions in Figure 2.3. Emissions are estimated using a 1-box model. 
In addition, the AGAGE 12-box model has been used to infer emissions from the AGAGE network (Prinn et al., 2000; updates provided by D. 
Cunnold). A time-dependent scaling for each component, taking into account the vertical distribution in the troposphere and the stratosphere, 
has been adopted in all the estimates. These scaling factors are taken from the AGAGE 12-box model. Emissions of HFC-23 are based on a 2-D 
model (Oram et al., 1998, with updates). The inferred emissions are compared with emissions from AFEAS and EDGAR (see references in the 
text) when those were available.

magnitude smaller than contributions from closer sources, as a 
result of both fewer transport events to Mace Head and greater 
dilution during transport (Ryall et al., 2001). 
 
Table 2.2 shows that from 1987 to 2000European emis-
sions inferred from the Mace Head observations of CH3CCl3 
appear to have declined from over 200 kt yr–1 to under 1 kt 
yr–1. This sharp decline reﬂects the inﬂuence of its phase-out 
under the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments, and its use 
largely as a solvent with minimal ‘banking’. In contrast, Krol 
et al. (2003) have estimated European emissions of CH3CCl3 to 
have been greater than 20 kt yr–1 during 2000, based on aircraft 
sampling during the EXPORT (European Export of Precursors 
and Ozone by Long-Range Transport) campaign over central 
Europe. Furthermore, substantial emissions were found dur-
ing the MINOS (Mediterranean Intensive Oxidant Study) ex-
periment in southeast Europe during 2001. A more detailed 
reanalysis of the observations at Mace Head and Jungfraujoch, 
Switzerland, gave emissions in the range 0.3–3.4 kt yr–1 for 
2000–2002 (Reimann et al., 2004). The reasons for the signiﬁ-
cant differences between the estimates of European emissions 
based on long-term observations and those from the EXPORT 
campaign are unclear. Data from the EXPORT campaign were 
restricted to four days in the summer of 2000, so they were 
more prone to the potential inﬂuence of regional events of lim-
ited duration compared with the long-term observations.
 
European source strengths of a number of halons and CFC-
replacement halocarbons have been determined (Manning et al. 
2003) using the AGAGE in situ high-frequency gas chromatog-
raphy-mass spectrometric GC-MS observations made alongside 
the AGAGE electron capture detector (ECD) measurements 
(Simmonds et al., 1998) at Mace Head, and are shown in Table 
2.3. The emissions of HCFC-22, HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b 
appear to have reached a peak during the 1997–2001 period, 
and have begun to decline rapidly from about 1998–2000 on-
wards. The corresponding emissions of HFC-134a rose quickly 
during the late 1990s, with some levelling off through 2003. 
The emissions of HFC-152a have only recently, from about 
1998 onwards, begun to rise and have reached about 2 kt yr–1 
each by 2002–2003.
 
In situ GC-MS observations of HFC-134a, HFC-125, HFC-
152a and HCFC-141b have been reported from the high-altitude 
research station in Jungfraujoch, Switzerland, for the 2000–2002 
period by Reimann et al. (2004). Using mole fraction ratios rela-
tive to CO, together with a European CO emission inventory, 
Reimann et al. (2004) estimated European emissions of HFC-
134a, HFC-125, HFC-152a and HCFC-141b to be 23.6, 2.2, 0.8 
and 9.0 kt yr–1, respectively. These estimated emissions of HFC-
134a are twice those from the Mace Head observations in Table 
2.3. Reimann et al. (2004) explain this difference by the close 
proximity of the Jungfraujoch station to a potent source region 
in northern Italy. The estimated European emissions of HFC-
125 and of HCFC-141b from Jungfraujoch and Mace Head 
agree closely. For HFC-152a, the estimated emissions from 
Jungfraujoch appear to be about half of those from Mace Head.
 
In addition to the application of long-range transport mod-
els, other techniques can be used to determine regional emis-

Head, Ireland, over the period 1987–2000. A simple long-range transport model (Simmonds et al., 1996) was used for the 1987–1994 period, 
and a Lagrangian dispersion model (Ryall et al., 2001) was used for the 1995–2000 period.

sions from trace-gas observations. Concurrent measurement of 
the trace gas concentrations with those of 222Rn, a radioactive 
noble gas with a short half-life that is emitted by soils, has been 
used to determine continental-scale emission source strengths 
(Thom et al., 1993). Using the 222Rn method for the year 1996, 
Biraud et al. (2000) determined European emissions of CFC-11 
to be 1.8–2.5 kg km–2 yr–1 and of CFC-12 to be 2.9–4.2 kg km–2 
yr–1. Schmidt et al. (2001) reported a mean continental N2O ﬂux 
of 42 µg m–2 h–1 (580 kg km–2 yr–1) for Western Europe. These 
estimates of European CFC emissions compare closely with the 
estimates from Ryall et al. (2001) in Table 2.2, which use the 
Lagrangian dispersion model method, when they are scaled up 
with a European surface area of the order of 1.45 × 107 km2.
 
Estimates of halocarbon emissions for North America have 
been made by Bakwin et al. (1997) and Hurst et al. (1998) us-
ing the simultaneous high-frequency measurements of perchlo-
roethylene (C2Cl4) and a range of halocarbons made on a 610 m 
tall tower in North Carolina. The North American halocarbon 
source strengths for 1995 were 12.9 kt yr–1 for CFC-11, 49 kt yr–
1 for CFC-12, 3.9 kt yr–1 for CFC-113, 47.9 kt yr–1 for CH3CCl3, 
and 2.2 kt yr–1 for CCl4, as reported by Bakwin et al. (1997), 
and these estimates are signiﬁcantly lower than the emission 
inventory estimates of McCulloch et al. (2001). Downwards 
trends are reported for North American emissions of the major 
anthropogenic halocarbons (Hurst et al., 1998).
 
Barnes et al. (2003a,b) found contrasting results when they 
used a ratio technique involving CO, C2Cl4 and the halocarbon 
observations at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA, to esti-
mate emissions. They found that, of all the ODSs emitted from 
the New York City-Washington D.C. corridor during 1996–
1998, only the emissions of CFC-12 and CH3CCl3 showed a de-
tectable decline, which approached a factor of three. In contrast, 
the regional emissions of CFC-11 appeared to rise slightly, by 
about 6%, over this period. The emissions of CFC-113 and 
Halon-1211 did not show any distinguishable trend pattern.
2.4 
Decomposition and degradation products from 
HCFCs, HFCs, HFEs, PFCs and NH3
This section discusses the degradation products of HCFCs, 
HFCs, HFEs, PFCs and NH3 and their impacts on local and re-
gional air quality, human and ecosystem health, radiative forc-
ing of climate change, and stratospheric ozone depletion. The 
concentration of degradation products is a key factor in quan-
tifying their impacts. A method to estimate the concentrations 
of the degradation products from emissions of the parent com-
pounds is discussed in Section 2.4.1.2. Although each chemical 
has to be evaluated on its own, three general remarks are use-
ful in framing the following discussion. First, ﬂuorine-contain-
ing radicals produced in the atmospheric degradation of HFCs, 
HFEs and PFCs do not participate in catalytic ozone destruc-
tion cycles (Ravishankara et al., 1994; Wallington et al., 1995). 
Hence, the ozone depletion potentials (ODPs) of HFCs, HFEs, 
and PFCs are essentially zero. In contrast, HCFCs contain chlo-
rine and consequently have non-zero ODPs. Second, the emis-
sions of HCFCs, HFCs and HFEs are very small compared with 
the mass of hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere, and the 
atmospheric lifetime of most HCFCs, HFCs, HFEs and PFCs 
allows their effective dispersal. As a result the concentrations of 
the degradation products of HCFCs, HFCs, HFEs and PFCs are 
small and their impact on local and regional air quality (i.e., on 
tropospheric ozone) is negligible (Hayman and Derwent, 1997). 
Third, the ultimate atmospheric fate of all HCFCs, HFCs, HFEs 
and PFCs is oxidation to halogenated carbonyl compounds and 
HF, which are transferred via dry deposition and wet deposition 
(rain-out or washout) from the atmosphere to the hydrosphere. 
The impact of these compounds on terrestrial ecosystems and 
the hydrosphere (e.g., lakes, oceans) needs to be considered.

Degradation products from HCFCs, HFCs and 
HFEs
2.4.1.1 
Chemical degradation mechanisms
The atmospheric chemistry of HCFCs and HFCs is, in gen-
eral, well established (see WMO, 1999; WMO, 2003). PFCs 
degrade extremely slowly and persist for thousands of years 
(Ravishankara et al., 1993). Hydroﬂuoroethers (HFEs) have 
been considered recently as possible CFC replacements. 
Kinetic and mechanistic data for the tropospheric degradation 
of a number of HFEs have become available over the past ﬁve

The environmental impact of HCFCs and HFCs is deter-
mined mainly by the tropospheric lifetimes and emission rates of 
the parent compounds and by the halogenated carbonyl species 
formed as oxidation products in the atmosphere. The general 
scheme for the tropospheric degradation of HCFCs and HFCs 
into halogenated carbonyl compounds is outlined below. Figure 
2.5a shows the degradation mechanism for a generic two-carbon 
HCFC or HFC. Figure 2.5b shows similar data for C4F9OCH3 
as an example HFE. The oxidation products of HCFCs, HFCs, 
HFEs and PFCs are not routinely measured in the atmosphere 
so their concentrations need to be estimated. There are some 
measurements of the concentrations of the degradation product 
triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA, CF3C(O)OH) (Martin et al., 2003).
 
Degradation is initiated by the gas-phase reaction with hy-
droxyl (OH) radicals. This process, which involves either H-
atom abstraction from C-H groups, or addition to unsaturated 
>C=C< groups, is the slowest step in the atmospheric degrada-
tion process. There is a large database of rate coefﬁcients for 
reactions of OH radicals with halogenated compounds (Sander 
et al. 2000, 2003), which provides a means of estimating tropo-
spheric lifetimes for these compounds. Moreover, this database 
allows rate coefﬁcients to be estimated (typically within a fac-
tor of about two) for compounds for which no experimental 
data are available. Reaction with OH generates a radical, which 
adds O2 rapidly (within 10–6 s) to give a peroxy radical.
 
The lifetime of peroxy radicals with respect to their reaction 
with NO is approximately 1 to 10 minutes. The reaction gives an 
alkoxy radical, CX3CXYO, which will either decompose or react 
with O2 on a time scale of typically 10–3 to 10–6 s (Wallington et 
al., 1994). Decomposition can occur either by C-C bond ﬁssion 
or Cl-atom elimination. Reaction with O2 is only possible when 
an α-H atom is available (e.g., in CF3CFHO). In the case of the 
alkoxy radicals derived from HFC-32, HFC-125 and HCFC-22, 
only one reaction pathway is available. Hence, CHF2O radicals 
react with O2 to give C(O)F2, CF3CF2O radicals decompose to 
give CF3 radicals and C(O)F2, and CF2ClO radicals eliminate a 
Cl atom to give C(O)F2. The alkoxy radicals derived from HFC-
143a, HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b 
have two or more possible fates, but one loss mechanism domi-
nates in the atmosphere. For HCFC-123 and HCFC-124 the dom-
inant process is elimination of a Cl atom to give CF3C(O)Cl and 
CF3C(O)F, respectively. For HFC-143a, HCFC-141b and HCFC-
142b reaction with O2 dominates, giving CF3CHO, CFCl2CHO 
and CF2ClCHO respectively. The case of HFC-134a is the most 
complex. Under atmospheric conditions, the alkoxy radical de-
rived from HFC-134a, CF3CFHO, decomposes (to give CF3 radi-
cals and HC(O)F) and reacts with O2 (to give CF3C(O)F and HO2 
radicals) at comparable rates. In the atmosphere 7–20% of the 
CF3CFHO radicals formed in the CF3CFHO2 + NO reaction react 
with O2 to form CF3C(O)F, whereas the remainder decompose to 
give CF3 radicals and HC(O)F (Wallington et al., 1996).
 
The carbonyl products (e.g., HC(O)F, C(O)F2, CF3C(O)F) 
have atmospheric lifetimes measured in days. Incorporation into 
water droplets followed by hydrolysis plays an important role 
in the removal of halogenated carbonyl compounds (DeBruyn

et al., 1992). In the case of HC(O)F, the reactions of C(O)F2, 
FC(O)Cl and CF3C(O)F with OH radicals (Wallington and 
Hurley, 1993) and photolysis (Nölle et al., 1992) are too slow to 
be of any signiﬁcance. These compounds are removed entirely 
by incorporation into water droplets. Following uptake in clouds 
or surface water, the halogenated acetyl halogens (CF3C(O)Cl 
and CF3C(O)F) are hydrolyzed to TFA. Degradation products 
are summarized in Table 2.4.
 
Although there have been no studies of the degradation 
products of PFCs, the atmospheric oxidation of PFCs will give 
essentially the same ﬂuorinated radical species that are formed 
during the oxidation of HFCs, HFEs and HCFCs. Based on our 
knowledge of the atmospheric degradation products of HFCs, 
HFEs and HCFCs it can be stated with high conﬁdence that 
PFC degradation products will have short atmospheric lifetimes 
and negligible GWPs.
2.4.1.2 
Atmospheric concentrations of degradation 
products
Using a mass balance argument, the global production rate of a 
degradation product should be equal to the yield of the product 
times the emission rate of the source gas. If the local lifetime of 
the degradation product is sufﬁciently long that its concentration 
is approximately uniform in the troposphere or stratosphere, the 
production rate can then be used to estimate the average con-
centration of the degradation product in either compartment. In 
more general cases, the concentration of degradation products 
is determined by (1) the local concentration and local lifetime 
of the parent compound, (2) the product yields, and (3) the lo-
cal lifetime of the degradation products. The evaluation of the 
degradation products for shorter-lived species will be discussed 
in Sections 2.5.3 and 2.6.
 
Removal of HCFCs and HFCs is initiated by gas-phase re-
actions with local lifetimes that are typically of the order of 
years, whereas the ﬁrst generation degradation products are 
removed by rain and clouds, with local lifetimes that are typi-
cally of the order of days. Thus, the local concentration of the 
degradation products will be much smaller (approximately 100 
to 1000 times) than the source gas. Short-lived intermediate 
degradation products such as halogenated carbonyl compounds 
will be present at extremely low atmospheric concentrations. 
2.4.1.3 
Concentrations in other environmental 
compartments
Halogenated carbonyl degradation products (e.g., CF3COF, 
COF2) that resist gas-phase reactions are removed from the 
atmosphere by rain-out, wet deposition, and dry deposition. 
An interesting quantity is the concentration of these species in 
surface water. Using production of TFA from HFC-134a as an 
example Rodriguez et al. (1993) calculated that the steady-state

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
global averaged rain-water concentration of TFA is of the order 
of 1 µg L–1 for an annual emission of 1000 kt yr–1 of HFC-134a. 
Subsequent calculations using a 3-D model (Kotamarthi et al., 
1998) showed that the local rain-water concentration averaged 
over 10-degree latitude and longitude bands would typically 
deviate from the global average number by a factor of two. 
Variation can be much larger on a local scale. 
2.4.2 
Triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA, CF3C(O)OH))
TFA is produced during the atmospheric degradation of several 
CFC replacements, and partitions into the aqueous compart-
ments of the environment (Bowden et al., 1996). Reaction with 
OH radicals in the gas phase accounts for 10–20% of the loss of 
TFA (Møgelberg et al., 1994). The major fate of TFA is rain-out. 
The environmental impact of TFA has been studied thoroughly 
and results have been reviewed in the UNEP effects-assessment 
reports of 1998 (Tang et al., 1998) and 2002 (Solomon et al., 
2003). TFA is highly soluble in water, is a strong acid with Pka 
of 0.23 and the logarithm of its n-octanol/water partition coef-
ﬁcient is –0.2, which indicates that it will essentially partition in 
the water compartment and will not bioaccumulate in animals. 
Little accumulation (concentration factor of approximately 10) 
occurs in plants exposed to TFA. In a long-term study (90 weeks) 
(Kim et al., 2000) it was shown that TFA could be biodegraded 
in an engineered anaerobic waste-water treatment system at a 
TFA concentration up to 30 mg L–1 (as ﬂuoride). However, it 
is unclear how this result should be extrapolated to natural en-
vironments, where concentrations of TFA and nutrients will be 
different. Ellis et al. (2001) observed no signiﬁcant degrada-
tion during a 1-year mesocosm study. In the water compartment 
no signiﬁcant abiotic degradation process has been identiﬁed 
(Boutonnet et al., 1999). TFA is a persistent substance. Aquatic 
ecotoxicity studies showed that the most sensitive standard 
algae species was the algae Selenastrum capricornutum with 
a no-effect concentration of 0.10 mg L–1 (0.12 mg L–1 for the 
sodium salt NaTFA) (Berends et al., 1999). Thus, TFA con-
centrations approaching a milligram per litre may be toxic to 
some aquatic life forms. The TFA concentration in rain water 
resulting from HFC and HCFC degradation for the year 2010 
is expected to be approximately 100 to 160 ng L–1 (Kotamarthi 
et al., 1998), which is approximately 1000 times smaller than 
the no-observed-effect concentration of S. Capricornutum. This 
result and the absence of signiﬁcant bioaccumulation in biota 
indicate that no adverse effect on the environment is expected 
(Tang et al., 1998; Solomon et al., 2003). TFA is not metabo-
lized in mammalian systems. Toxicity studies indicate that TFA 
will have biological effects similar to other strong acids (Tang 
et al., 1998). In conclusion, no adverse effects on human or 
ecosystem health are expected from the TFA produced by at-
mospheric degradation of CFC substitutes.
 
Atmospheric concentrations of HFC-134a, HCFC-124, and 
HCFC-123 have been measured at 25.5 ppt, 1.34 ppt, and 0.03 
ppt, respectively (see Table 2.1). The corresponding atmospher-
ic burdens are 439.0 kt, 30.84 kt, and 0.774 kt, respectively. 
Degradation ﬂuxes can be calculated using lifetime values from 
WMO (2003) and TFA yields, and TFA ﬂuxes can be calculated 
at 10,266 t yr –1 of TFA for the year 2000 (Table 2.5).
 
TFA has been observed in varying concentrations in surface 
waters (oceans, rivers and lakes) and in fog, snow and rain-water 
samples around the globe, for example, in the USA, Germany, 
Israel, Ireland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Russia, South Africa 
and Finland (see references in Nielsen et al., 2001). TFA appears 
to be a ubiquitous component of the contemporary hydrosphere. 
TFA is reported in concentrations of about 200 ng L–1 in ocean 
water down to depths of several thousand meters (Frank et al., 
2002). If 200 ng L–1 is the average concentration of TFA in all 
ocean water, the oceans contain around 3 × 108 t of TFA. With an 
anthropogenic contribution of 10,266 t yr–1 it would have taken 
approximately 3400 years to achieve the present TFA concentra-
tion in ocean waters; therefore, industrial sources cannot explain 
the observed abundance of TFA in ocean water. High TFA con-
centrations in the Dead Sea and Nevada lakes, of 6400 ng L–1 
and 40,000 ng L–1, respectively, suggest long-term accumula-

tion over centuries and the existence of pre-industrial sources of 
TFA (Boutonnet et al., 1999). However, TFA was not found in 
pre-industrial (>2000 years old) fresh water taken from Greenland 
and Denmark (Nielsen et al., 2001). Therefore, although it ap-
pears that there is a signiﬁcant natural source of TFA, the identity 
of this source is unknown. 
 
Because of the persistence of TFA, it has been suggested that 
it could accumulate in aquatic ecosystems like vernal pools or 
seasonal wetlands, which dry out periodically, are replenished 
by rainfall and are presumed to have little or no seepage (Tromp 
et al., 1995). A sensitivity study (Tromp et al., 1995) based on 
mathematical modelling suggested that such accumulation 
could take place if a series of conditions (a polluted area with 
high atmospheric concentrations of the precursors and the OH 
radical; pollution and rainfall events that occur at the same time; 
and little, or no, seepage) could be maintained simultaneously 
for several decades. An example cited by the authors indicated 
that if the concentration of TFA in rain water was assumed to 
be 1 µg L–1, and the loss frequencies were 5 yr–1 for evaporation 
and of 0.1 yr–1 for seepage, the TFA concentration could reach 
100 µg L–1 (which corresponds to the no-effect concentration of 
the most sensitive aquatic species) in 30 years. The probability 
that such a combination of events would be maintained over 
several decades appears to be rather low (Solomon et al., 2003). 
Studies of pond water (Tang et al., 1998) conﬁrmed TFA’s per-
sistent behaviour but did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant accumulation. TFA 
evapoconcentration was observed during two years in 1998 and 
1999 in vernal pools in California (Cahill et al., 2001). Some 
TFA retention was also observed between the years 1998 and 
1999 but was not easily quantiﬁed. Cahill et al. (2001) sug-
gested that in very wet years surface-water export may occur 
and may limit long-term TFA accumulation. Concentrations ob-
served at the beginning of the study in January 1998 were about 
130 ng L–1 (in the range of expected rain-water concentrations) 
and suggest that accumulation was not maintained in previous 
years. Although some accumulation is likely in such systems 
because of TFA persistence, observations indicate that the spe-
ciﬁc conditions required for accumulation in seasonal wetlands 
are unlikely to be maintained for several decades.
2.4.3 
Other halogenated acids in the environment
Long-chain 
perﬂuorinated 
carboxylic 
acids 
(PFCAs, 
CnF2n+1COOH, where n = 6–12) have been observed in biota, 
and in surface and ground water (Moody and Field, 1999; 
Moody et al., 2001; Moody et al., 2002; Martin et al., 2004). 
These PFCAs have no known natural sources, are bioaccumula-
tive, and have no known loss mechanisms in the environment. 
The health effects from exposure to perﬂuorooctanoic acid are 
the subject of a present risk assessment (US EPA, 2003).
 
PFCAs are not generally used directly in industrial mate-
rials or consumer products. The observation of PFCAs in re-
mote locations presumably reﬂects their formation as degra-
dation products of precursor chemicals in the atmosphere. It 
has been suggested that degradation of ﬂuorotelomer alcohols, 
F(CF2CF2)nCH2CH2OH (n = 3–6), is a likely source of PFCAs 
observed in remote locations (Andersen et al., 2003; Ellis et 
al., 2004), but the importance of this source is unclear. Further 
studies are needed to quantify the sources of PFCAs in the en-
vironment. HFCs, HCFCs and HFEs used as CFC replacements 
generally have short-chain ﬂuorinated alkyl substituents and so 
will not contribute to long-chain PFCA pollution. 
 
Several haloacetic acids (HAA) have been detected in en-
vironmental samples. Besides TFA, monochloroacetic acid 
(MCA), dichloroacetic acid (DCA), and trichloroacetic acid 
(TCA) (Scott et al., 2000) and chlorodiﬂuoroacetic acid (CDFA) 
(Martin et al., 2000) have been measured in, for example, rain, 
snow and lake samples. The contribution of HCFCs to chlo-
roﬂuoro-substituted carboxylic acids is unclear.
2.4.4 
Ammonia (NH3)
It is widely recognized that the bulk of the atmospheric emis-
sions of ammonia (NH3) is removed from the atmosphere by 
dry and wet deposition processes and by reaction with strong 
acids to form ammonium compounds. The latter are important 
aerosol components with direct and indirect effects on radiative 
forcing. Some of the NH3 emitted at the surface survives and is 
carried into the free troposphere above the atmospheric bound-
ary layer. There, the main removal process for NH3 is by the 
reaction with hydroxyl OH radicals:
OH + NH3 → H2O + NH2 
 
[2.3]
The lifetime of NH3 in the troposphere attributed to Reaction 
[2.3] has been estimated to range from 72 to 109 days 
(Finlayson-Pitts and Pitts, 2000; Warneck, 1999). The main re-
action product of NH3 degradation is the amidogen NH2 radical, 
whose main fate is to react with NOx and ozone and thereby act 
as a source or a sink for NOx and as a source of nitrous oxide 
(N2O), which is a long-lived well-mixed greenhouse gas:
NH2 + NO → N2 + H2O 
 
[2.4]
NH2 + NO2 → N2O + H2O 
 
[2.5]
NH2 + O3 → NH2O + O2 
 
[2.6]
In a 3-D chemistry-transport model study, Dentener and Crutzen 
(1994) suggested that the degradation of NH3 may generate up 
to about 1 TgN yr–1 of N2O from a global NH3 source strength 
of 45 Tg yr–1. It should be noted that 1 TgN yr–1 of N2O would 
represent about 6% of the global source strength of N2O (as N) 
inferred by IPCC (2001, Chapter 4). However, because there is 
some question whether Reaction [2.5] occurs in the atmosphere 
as written here, the conversion of NH3 to N2O may be much 
smaller (Warneck, 1999).

2.5 
Radiative properties and global warming 
potentials
Halocarbons released into the atmosphere can affect climate 
in several ways. These molecules mostly absorb radiation in 
a spectral window region of the outgoing thermal longwave 
radiation (see Figure 2.6) and hence are efﬁcient greenhouse 
gases. Halocarbons can also have indirect effects on climate by 
causing destruction of ozone (see Chapter 1) or through altera-
tions to tropospheric chemistry (see Section 2.5.3). 
 
Global climate models are the tools that are used to under-
stand and predict how current and future human emissions of 
halocarbons contribute to climate forcing. The concepts of radi-
ative forcing and global warming potential (GWP) (see Box 2.2 
for deﬁnitions) were introduced in 1990 (IPCC, 1990; Fisher 
et al., 1990). They are still widely used as convenient ways to 
compare and quantify the relative contribution of equal-mass 
emissions of different gases to climate forcing, even if it is ac-
knowledged that the use of these simpliﬁed formulations has its 
limitations. Recent publications highlight that different calcula-
tions are possible to derive radiative forcings (Hansen et al., 
2002; Gregory et al., 2004) and that other possible tools can 
be constructed to compare the climate impacts of greenhouse 
gases (Shine et al., 2003; Shine et al., 2005).
2.5.1 
Calculation of GWPs 
The contribution of a gas to the warming of the atmosphere is a 
function of its ability to absorb the longwave infrared radiation 
over a speciﬁed period of time, which in turn depends on its 
concentration, atmospheric steady-state lifetime, and infrared 
absorption properties (see Figure 2.7).

The direct GWP of a gas x is calculated as the ratio of 
the time-integrated radiative forcing from a pulse emission 
of 1 kg of that gas relative to that of 1 kg of a reference gas
 
(2.5)
where TH is the integration time (the time horizon) over which 
the calculation is performed. The gas chosen as reference is 
generally CO2, although its atmospheric decay function is sub-
ject to substantial scientiﬁc uncertainties (IPCC, 1994). 
 
The numerator of Equation (2.5) is the absolute GWP 
(AGWP) of a gas. In practice, the AGWP is calculated using 
the following procedure: 
 
 
  
   
 
(2.6)
where, ax is the radiative forcing due to a unit mass increase 
of the gas x distributed according to its expected steady-state 
distribution for continuous emission, ΔBx(t) is the change in 
burden due to the pulse emission, and τx is the lifetime of the 
perturbation of species x.
 
The calculation is performed over a ﬁnite period of time 
to facilitate policy considerations. The integration time ranges 
from 20 to 50 years if atmospheric response (e.g., surface tem-
perature change) is of interest, or from 100 to 500 years if a 
long-term effect (such as sea-level rise) is to be considered. 
 
Substances with very long lifetimes, such as PFCs and 
SF6, have contributions that may exceed these time scales, and 
hence the use of GWP may be inadequate for these species. 
Conversely, one should be cautious about using the derived 
GWP values for gases with lifetimes shorter than 5 years that 
may not be uniformly mixed in the atmosphere, although the 
concept may be used to some extent for short-lived species and 
can be applied to the calculation of indirect contributions as ad-
dressed in Section 2.5.3.
2.5.2 
Calculation of radiative forcing 
The radiative forcing due to a change in the abundance of a 
greenhouse gas is the net (down minus up) irradiance change 
(in watts per square meter, W m–2) at the tropopause induced by 
this perturbation. It is calculated using a forward radiative-trans-
fer code that computes the irradiance at different atmospheric 
levels, with the infrared absorption spectrum of the molecule as 
a key input. Calculation can be performed using simpliﬁed as-
sumptions (clear-sky instantaneous forcings) or using improved 
schemes that take into account cloud coverage and allow strat-
ospheric temperatures to re-adjust to radiative equilibrium (ad-
Box 2.2. Deﬁnitions of radiative forcing and global warming potential (GWP)
Radiative forcing
• The radiative forcing quantiﬁes the ability of a gas to perturb the Earth’s radiative energy budget.
• Deﬁnition: The radiative forcing of the surface-troposphere system due to the perturbation in or the introduction of gas 
is the change in net (down minus up) irradiance (solar plus longwave, in W m–2) at the tropopause, after allowing for 
stratospheric temperatures to re-adjust to radiative equilibrium, but with surface and tropospheric temperatures and other 
state variables (clouds, water) held ﬁxed at the unperturbed values.
Global warming potential (GWP)
• The global warming potential is a relative index used to compare the climate impact of an emitted greenhouse gas, relative 
to an equal amount of carbon dioxide.
• Deﬁnition: The global warming potential is the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from a pulse emission of 1 kg 
of a substance, relative to that of 1 kg of carbon dioxide, over a ﬁxed horizon period.

justed cloud forcings). Because of the current low abundances 
of the halocarbons in the atmosphere, their radiative forcing is 
proportional to their atmospheric abundance. This is to be con-
trasted with abundant gases, such as CO2, for which the effect 
is nonlinear because of saturation of absorption. 
 
Halocarbons exhibit strong absorption bands in the thermal 
infrared atmospheric window (see Figure 2.6) because of their 
various vibrational modes. Absorption spectra of CFCs and the 
majority of proposed substitutes are characterized by absorp-
tion bands rather than lines, because individual spectral lines 
for these heavy molecules are overlapping and not resolved at 
tropospheric pressures and temperatures. For each gas, the ab-
sorption cross-sections (in cm2 per molecule) are derived from 
laboratory measurements for speciﬁc atmospheric conditions. 
Several independent measurements of absorption cross-sec-
tions for halocarbons have been reported in the literature (e.g., 
McDaniel et al., 1991; Clerbaux et al., 1993; Clerbaux and 
Colin, 1994; Varanasi et al., 1994; Pinnock et al., 1995; Barry 
et al., 1997; Christidis et al., 1997, Ko et al., 1999; Sihra et 
al., 2001; Orkin et al., 2003; Nemtchinov and Varanasi, 2004; 
Hurley et al., 20051) and some of these data sets are available 
through the widely used molecular spectroscopic databases, 
such as HITRAN (Rothman et al., 2003) and GEISA (Jacquinet-
Husson et al., 1999). The intercomparison of measured cross-
sections and integrated absorption intensities performed on 
the same molecule by different groups provides an estimate 
of the discrepancies among the obtained results, and hence of 
the measurement accuracy (e.g., Ballard et al., 2000; Forster et 
al., 2005). Although the discrepancies between different cross-
section measurements can reach 40% (Hurley et al., 2005), it 
is recognized that the typical uncertainties associated with the 
measured cross-section when integrated over the infrared spec-
tral range are less than 10%.
 
The measured spectroscopic data are then implemented 
into a radiative transfer model to compute the radiative ﬂuxes. 
Several radiative-transfer models are available, ranging from 
line-by-line to wide-bands models, depending on the spectral 
interval over which the calculation is performed. Apart from 
the uncertainties stemming from the cross-sections themselves, 
differences in the ﬂux calculation can arise from the spectral 
resolution used; tropopause heights; vertical, spatial and sea-
sonal distributions of the gases; cloud cover; and how strat-
ospheric temperature adjustments are performed. The impact of 
these parameters on radiative forcing calculations is discussed 
in comprehensive studies such as Christidis et al. (1997), 
Hansen et al. (1997), Myhre and Stordal (1997), Freckleton 
et al. (1998), Highwood and Shine (2000), Naik et al. (2000), 
Jain et al. (2000), Sihra et al. (2001) and Forster et al. (2005). 
The discrepancy in the radiative forcing calculation for differ-
ent halocarbons, which is associated with different assumptions 
used in the radiative transfer calculation or with use of different 
cross-section sets, can reach 40% (Gohar et al., 2004). Recent 
studies performed for the more abundant HFCs (HFC-23, HFC-
32, HFC-134a and HFC-227ea) report that an agreement better 
than 12% can be reached when the calculation conditions are 
better constrained (Gohar et al., 2004; Forster et al., 2005). 
 
Recommended radiative forcings and associated GWP val-
ues, gathered from previous reports and recently published data,

Other aspects affecting GWP calculations 
The discussion in the preceding sections describes methods to 
evaluate the direct radiative impact of emission of a source gas 
that has a sufﬁciently long lifetime so that it has a uniform mix-
ing ratio in the troposphere. This section considers two aspects 
of GWP calculations that are not covered by these methods. 
First, the direct impact refers only to the greenhouse warming 
arising from the accumulation of the source gas in the atmos-
phere, but does not consider its other radiatively important 
byproducts. There could be indirect effects if the degradation 
products of the gas also behaved like greenhouse gases (Section 
2.5.3.1), or if the presence of the emitted gas and its degradation 
products affected the distribution of other greenhouse gases 
(Section 2.5.3.2). Second, the special case of very short-lived 
source gases with non-uniform mixing ratios in the troposphere 
will be discussed (Section 2.5.3.3).
2.5.3.1 
Direct effects from decomposition products
The indirect radiative effects of the source gas include the di-
rect effects from its degradation products. As was discussed in 
Section 2.4.1 the local concentrations of most degradation prod-
ucts, with very few exceptions, are a factor of 100 (or more) 
smaller than that of the source gas. Assuming that the values for 
the radiative forcing of the source gas and its degradation prod-
ucts are similar, the indirect GWP from the degradation prod-
ucts should be much smaller than the direct GWP of the source 
gas except for cases where the local lifetime of the degradation 
product is longer than that of the source gas. CO2 is one of the 
ﬁnal degradation products of organic compounds. However the 
magnitude of the indirect GWP attributed to CO2 is equal to the 
number of carbons atoms in the original molecule, and is small 
compared with the direct GWP values of most of the halocar-
bons given in Table 2.6.
2.5.3.2 Indirect effects from inﬂuences on other atmospheric 
constituents
As discussed in Chapter 1, chlorine and bromine atoms released 
by halocarbons deplete ozone in the stratosphere. Because 
ozone is a greenhouse gas, its depletion leads to cooling of the 
climate system. This cooling is a key indirect effect of halo-
carbons on radiative forcing and is particularly signiﬁcant for 
gases containing bromine. 
 
Daniel et al. (1995) described a method for characterizing 
the net radiative forcing from halocarbons emitted in the year 
1990. Although the method and the values are often discussed 
1 This most recently published work was not available in time to be fully con-
sidered by the authors.

in the context of net GWP, it was clearly explained in Daniel 
et al. (1995) that they differ from direct GWP in the following 
ways:
1. The net GWP is most useful for comparing the relative 
radiative effects of different ODSs when emitted at the same 
time. In the type of calculations that may be performed in the 
following chapters, one may come across a situation where 
the GWP weighted emissions from several well-mixed 
greenhouse gases and ODSs add to zero. It is important to 
recognize that the result does not guarantee zero climate 
impact.
2. The amount of ozone depletion caused by an incremental 
emission of an ODS depends on the equivalent effective 
stratospheric chlorine (EESC) loading in the atmosphere. 
The concept of EESC has long been used to assess the effect 
of halocarbon emissions on the ozone-depleting effect of 
halogens in the stratosphere (Prather and Watson, 1990; 
Chapter 1 of WMO, 2003 and references therein; and Figure 
1.18 in Chapter 1 of this report). Ozone depletion ﬁrst began 
to be observable around 1980, and the date when EESC is 
projected to fall below its 1980 value can provide a rough 
estimate of the effects of emissions on the time scale for 
ozone recovery, assuming no changes in other parameters, 
such as atmospheric circulation or chemical composition. 
Chapter 1 of this report assesses in detail the factors that are 
likely to inﬂuence the date of ozone recovery, intercompares 
model estimates of the date, and discusses uncertainties in 
its absolute value. EESC is used here to indicate the relative 
effect of several different future emission scenarios on the 
date of ozone recovery, but not to identify the absolute value 
of the date. Current projections based on emission scenarios 
indicate that the threshold values for EESC will be achieved 
between 2043 and 2046, when there will be no further 
ozone depletion for incremental ODS emission. Because 
the indirect forcing of ODSs becomes zero after the EESC 
threshold is reached, indirect GWPs for emissions prior 
to that time decrease as they occur closer to the recovery 
threshold. Indirect GWPs for emissions that occur after the 
threshold is reached are zero.
The method described in Daniel et al. (1995) assumes an EESC-
loading curve for the future based on an emission scenario in 
compliance with the Montreal Protocol and its subsequent up-
dates. Values given in Daniel et al. (1995) are for several emis-
sion scenarios (future EESC curves) appropriate for emissions 
in 1990. Subsequent updates in IPCC (1994), WMO (1999) 
and IPCC (2001) use a single emission scenario for 1990 emis-
sion. The values in WMO (2003) are for an emission in the year 
2002. 
 
HCFCs, HFCs and some of their replacement gases (hydro-
carbons and ammonia) also have the potential to alter the ra-
diative balance in the atmosphere indirectly by inﬂuencing the 
sources or sinks of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Oxidation by 
hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the troposphere is the main removal 
process for the organic compounds emitted by human activi-
ties. This oxidation acts as a source of ozone and as a removal 
process for hydroxyl radicals, thereby reducing the efﬁciency 
of methane oxidation and promoting the build-up of methane. 
Therefore, emissions of organic compounds, including HCFCs, 
HFCs and some of their replacement gases, may lead to the 
build-up of two important greenhouse trace gases, methane and 
ozone, and consequently may cause an indirect radiative forc-
ing (e.g., Lelieveld et al., 1998; Johnson and Derwent, 1996; 
Fuglestvedt et al., 1999). The main factors inﬂuencing the 
magnitudes of such indirect radiative impacts were found to be 
their spatial emission patterns, chemical reactivity and trans-
port, molecular complexity, and the oxidation products formed 
(Collins et al., 2002).
 
Another possible indirect effect may result from the reac-
tion of the degradation products of HCFCs and HFCs with OH 
or O3, which may modify the OH or O3 distributions. However, 
it is unlikely that degradation products of the long-lived HCFCs 
and HFCs have a large impact on a global scale, because the 
effect would occur after the emission is distributed around the 
globe, which will result in relatively low concentrations.
2.5.3.3 
Very short-lived hydrocarbons
Assigning GWP values to very short-lived (VSL) species (spe-
cies with a lifetime of a month or shorter) presents a special 
challenge (WMO, 2003, Chapter 2). Because of their short life-
times VSL species are not uniformly distributed in the tropo-
sphere. Their distributions depend on where and when (during 
the year) they are emitted. Thus, it is not possible to assign a 
single steady-state change in burden in the troposphere per 
unit mass emission. In calculating the local change in radiative 
forcing, one would have to use their actual three-dimensional 
distributions. Furthermore, it is not obvious how one would es-
timate the change in surface temperature from the local changes 
in forcing. In a sense, the issue is similar to the situation for 
aerosol forcing. In such cases, the notion of GWP may prove 
less useful and one would have to examine the local climate 
impact directly, along with other indirect effects, such as ozone 
and aerosol formation. 
 
Given the infrared absorption cross-section of a VSL spe-
cies, it is possible to use current tools to compute a local ra-
diative forcing per unit burden change for a local column. This 
value can be used to obtain estimates for a GWP-like quantity 
by examining the decay rate of a pulse emission. In most cases 
this value will be small compared with the GWP value of the 
long-lived HCFCs and HFCs, and may indicate that the glo-
bal impact from VSL species used as halocarbon substitutes is 
small. However, it is not clear how such forcing may produce 
impacts on a smaller (e.g., regional) scale.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
warming potential (AGWP) of the gas to that of the reference 
gas CO2. GWP values are subject to change if the radiative ef-
ﬁciency or the lifetime of the gas are updated, or if the AGWP 
for CO2 changes. The radiative efﬁciency of a gas can change 
if there is an update to its absorption cross-section, or if there is 
a change in the background atmosphere. IPCC (2001) used 364 
ppm for the background mixing ratio of CO2 and 1.548 × 10–5 
W m–2 ppb–1 for its radiative efﬁciency for GWP calculations. 
The corresponding AGWP values for the 20-, 100- and 500-
year time horizons were 0.207, 0.696 and 2.241 W m–2 yr–1 
ppm–1, respectively. Most of the GWP values in Table 2.6 are 
taken from the WMO (2003) report, but they were updated if 
more recent published data were available (Gohar et al., 2004; 
Forster et al., 2005). Current values differ from the previously 
reported values (IPCC, 2001) by amounts ranging from –37% 
(HFC-123) to +43% (Halon-1211), mostly because of lifetime 
updates. For completeness, the GWP values as reported in 
IPCC (1996) – that is, the values adopted under the UNFCCC 
for the national inventories – are also provided for the 100-year 
time horizon. Relative to the values reported in IPCC (1996), 
the recommended GWPs (for the 100-year time horizon) have 
been modiﬁed from –16% (HCFC-123) to +51% (HFC-236fa), 
depending on the gas, with an average change of +15%. Most 
of these changes occur because of the updated AGWP of CO2 
used in IPCC (2001).
 
The absolute accuracy in the GWP calculations is subject 
to the uncertainties in estimating the atmospheric steady-state 
lifetimes and radiative efﬁciencies of the individual gases and 
of the CO2 reference. These uncertainties have been described 
to some extent in the earlier sections. It was shown in the pre-
vious paragraph that the discrepancies between the direct re-
ported GWPs and the values from IPCC (1996) can be as high 
as ±50%. 
 
The direct radiative forcings caused by a 1-ppb increase 
(the radiative efﬁciency) of some non-methane hydrocarbons 
(NMHCs) are also included in Table 2.6. It has been estimated 
that the global mean direct radiative forcing attributed to an-
thropogenic emissions of NMHCs in the present-day atmos-
phere is unlikely to be more than 0.015 W m–2 higher than in the 
pre-industrial atmosphere (Highwood et al., 1999). This value 
is highly uncertain because of the large dependence on the ver-
tical proﬁles of these short-lived gases, the natural contribution 
to the burdens considered and the area-weighted distributions of 
the mixing-ratio scenarios. The corresponding direct GWPs of 
the NMHCs are probably insigniﬁcant, because NMHCs have 
much shorter lifetimes than halocarbons and other greenhouse 
gases. 
 
The indirect GWPs calculated from the cooling that results 
from stratospheric ozone depletion are discussed in Section 
2.5.3.2. Table 2.7 presents direct and indirect GWPs for a 100-
year horizon for ODSs. The indirect GWPs are estimated from 
observed ozone depletion between 1980 and 1990 and adapted

tion between 1980 and 1990 for 2005 emissions.

for 2005 emissions. The estimated uncertainties in indirect 
GWPs are high, and are caused by a 70% uncertainty in deter-
mining the radiative forcing from ozone depletion. Also, direct 
and indirect GWPs cannot be simply added, because these are 
global averages. 
 
NMHCs can have an indirect radiative forcing through 
tropospheric chemistry interactions. As described in Section 
2.5.3.2, methane concentrations increase when the hydroxyl 
radicals are consumed by the more reactive organic compounds 
emitted during anthropogenic activities. The photochemical 
production of ozone, also a greenhouse gas, is also enhanced 
by an increased burden of NMHCs. Indirect GWPs for some 
alkanes and alkenes have been estimated from global averages 
by Collins et al. (2002) and are given in Table 2.8. This study 
also considered the increase in CO2 as a result of the oxida-
tion of these compounds. The GWPs attributed to the indirect 
chemical effects are much more important than their direct con-
tribution to radiative forcing. However, the indirect GWPs of 
the alkanes and alkenes considered as replacement refrigerants 
are relatively small compared with other non-ozone-depleting 
halocarbons, and are highly uncertain. This uncertainty arises 
because the indirect radiative impacts of alkanes and alkenes 
depend strongly on the location and season of the emission, so 
it is difﬁcult to give a single number that covers all circum-
stances and eventualities. The indirect GWPs in Table 2.8 are 
meant to be averages over the year for hydrocarbons emitted in 
polluted environments in the major Northern Hemisphere con-
tinents.
2.5.5 
Future radiative forcing
This section presents future direct radiative forcings of ODSs 
and their replacements based on the emissions scenarios from 
IPCC SRES (IPCC, 2000) and on emission scenarios from 
Chapter 11. The direct radiative forcings were calculated from 
the simpliﬁed expression ΔF = α(X – X0) (IPCC, 2001, Chapter 
6), where X is the projected concentration of a substance in ppb, 
X0 is its pre-industrial global concentration, and α is its radiative 
efﬁciency (from Table 2.6). In this section the term radiative 
forcing refers to the future change in direct radiative forcing 
relative to pre-industrial conditions (in 1750) unless otherwise 
speciﬁed. Past radiative forcings (to the year 2000) are given in 
Table 1.1 in Chapter 1.
 
For the time frame up to 2100, the emissions from the IPCC 
SRES scenarios were used in IPCC (2001) to estimate a range 
of radiative forcings possible for HFCs and PFCs. The indi-
vidual radiative forcings of the HFCs are plotted in Figure 2.8 
using the B1 and A1B scenarios, which represent the low and a 
high future estimates in the SRES scenarios. The total radiative 
forcings of the HFCs and PFCs are plotted in Figure 2.9 for 
several SRES scenarios. Alternative scenarios up to 2015 for 
HFCs were derived by Ashford et al. (2004) (see also Chapter 
11) based on future demands for the refrigeration and foams 
sectors.
 
The contributions of HFCs and PFCs to the total radiative 
forcing of long-lived greenhouse gases around 2003 (relative 
to 1750) are about 0.0083 W m–2 (0.31%) and 0.0038 W m–2 
(0.15%), respectively. A natural background concentration of 
40 ppt is assumed for CF4 (IPCC, 2001). Radiative forcings of 
CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs up to 2003 are shown in Figure 2.10. 
 
The emissions used to calculate the future radiative forc-
ing of CFCs and HCFCs are based on WMO (2003, Chapter 
1) and of HFCs on the emissions scenarios from Ashford et al. 
(2004) (see also Chapter 11). The estimated radiative forcing 
of HFCs in 2015 is in the range of 0.022–0.025 W m–2 based 
on the SRES projections and in the range of 0.019–0.030 W 
m–2 based on scenarios from Ashford et al. (2004). The radia-
tive forcing of PFCs in 2015 is about 0.006 W m–2 based on 
SRES projections. The HFC and PFC radiative forcing corre-
sponds to about 6–10% and 2%, respectively, of the total esti-
mated radiative forcing due to CFCs and HCFCs in 2015 (esti-
mated at 0.297 W m–2 for the baseline scenario). Alternatively, 
the HFC and PFC radiative forcing corresponds to about 0.8% 
and 0.2%, respectively, of the estimated radiative forcing of all 
well-mixed greenhouse gases, with a contribution of the ODSs 
of about 10%.
 
Projections over longer time scales become more uncertain 
because of the growing inﬂuences of uncertainties in techno-
logical practices and policies. Based on the SRES emission sce-
narios (Figure 2.9), by 2050 the upper limit of the range of the

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
radiative forcing from HFCs is 0.14 W m–2 and from PFCs it is 
0.015 W m–2. By 2100 the upper limit of the range of the radia-
tive forcing from HFCs is 0.24 W m–2 and from PFCs it is 0.035 
W m–2. In comparison, the SRES forcing from CO2 by 2100 rang-
es from about 4.0 to 6.7 W m–2. The SRES emission scenarios 
suggest that HFC-134a contributes 50–55% to the total radiative 
forcing from HFCs (Figure 2.8), and that CF4 contributes about 
80% to the total radiative forcing from PFCs. Uncertainties in 
SRES emissions should be recognized – for example, the long-
term nearly linear growth in HFC emissions up to 2050 as envis-
aged in SRES scenarios is highly unlikely for the longer time 
frame. The contribution of the long-lived ODSs (CFCs, HCFCs 
and CCl4) decreases gradually from a maximum of 0.32 W m–2 
around 2005 to about 0.10 W m–2 in 2100 (IPCC, 2001).

Actions taken under the Montreal Protocol and its 
Adjustments and Amendments have led to replacement of CFCs 
with HCFCs, HFCs and other substances, and to changing of 
industrial processes. These actions have begun to reduce at-
mospheric chlorine loading, the radiative forcings of the CFCs 
(Figure 2.10), and have also reduced the total GWP-weighted 
annual emissions from halocarbons (Figure 2.11). Observations 
of the annual concentrations of the major halocarbons at mul-
tiple sites accurately quantify past changes in direct radiative 
forcing and emissions (see also Section 2.3.2). The combined 
CO2-equivalent emissions, calculated by multiplying the emis-
sions of a compound by its GWP, of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs 
have decreased from a peak of about 7.5 ± 0.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
around 1990 to about 2.5 ± 0.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (100-year time 
horizon) in 2000, or about 10% of the CO2 emissions due to 
global fossil-fuel burning in that year. 
 
Continued observations of CFCs and other ODSs in the at-
mosphere enable improved validation of estimates of the lag 
between production and emission to the atmosphere, and of 
the associated banks of these gases. Because the production of 
ODSs has been greatly reduced, annual changes in concentra-
tions of those gases widely used in applications – such as refrig-
eration, air conditioning, and foam blowing – are increasingly 
dominated by releases from existing banks. For example, CFC-
11 is observed to be decreasing at a rate about 60% slower than 
would occur in the absence of emissions, and CFC-12 is still 
increasing slightly rather than declining. The emission rates 
of these two gases for 2001–2003 were estimated to be about 
25–35% of their 1990 emission rates. In contrast, CFC-113 and 
CH3CCl3, which are used mainly as solvents with no signiﬁcant 
banking, are currently decreasing at a rate consistent with a de-
crease of more than 95% in their emission rates compared with 
their 1990 emission rates. Thus, continued monitoring of a suite 
of gases is placing tighter constraints on the derived emissions 
and their relationship to banks. This information provides new 
insights into the signiﬁcance of banks and end-of-life options 
for applications using HCFCs and HFCs as well.
 
Current banked halocarbons will make a substantial contri-
bution to future radiative forcing of climate for many decades 
unless a large proportion of these banks is destroyed. Large por-
tions of the global inventories of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs cur-
rently reside in banks. For example, it is estimated that about 
50% of the total global inventory of HFC-134a currently re-
sides in the atmosphere, whereas 50% resides in banks. Figure 
2.12 shows the evolution of the GWP-weighted bank size (for 
a 100-year time horizon) for halocarbons, based on a top-down 
approach using past reported production and detailed com-
parison with atmospheric concentrations (WMO, 2003). This 
approach suggests that release of the current banks of CFCs, 
HCFCs and HFCs to the atmosphere would correspond conser-
vatively to about 2.8, 3.4 and 1.0 GtCO2-eq, respectively, for 
a 100-year time horizon. Although observations of concentra-
tions constrain emissions well, estimates of banks depend on 
the cumulative difference between production and emission and 
so are subject to larger uncertainties. The bottom-up analysis 
by sectors as presented in this report (Chapter 11) suggests pos-
sible banks of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs of about 15.6, 3.8, and 
1.1 GtCO2-eq, for a 100-year time horizon. These approaches 
both show that current banks of halocarbons represent a sub-
stantial possible contribution to future radiative forcing.
 
If all of the ODSs in banks in 2004 were not released to the 
atmosphere, their direct positive radiative forcing could be re-
duced by about 0.018–0.025 W m–2 by 2015. Over the next two 
decades this positive radiative forcing change is expected to be 
about 4–5% of that caused by CO2 emissions over the same pe-

riod. The lower limit is based on the banks from WMO (2003, 
Chapter 1) and the upper limit on the banks from Ashford et al. 
(2004).
 
As mentioned before, observations of concentrations in the 
atmosphere constrain the past emissions, but the banks are the 
difference between cumulative emissions and production and 
have much larger uncertainties. The values of the emissions and 
banks of CFCs and HCFCs used for the Figures 2.11 and 2.12 
are based on WMO (2003). Ashford et al. (2004) reported banks 
of CFCs and HCFCS that were considerably larger than those 
of WMO (2003), especially for CFC-11 and CFC-12. The CFC-
11 bank in 2002 is 0.59 Mt according to WMO (2003) com-
pared with 1.68 Mt according to Ashford et al. (2004); the CFC-
12 bank in 2003 is virtually zero according to WMO (2003) 
compared with 0.65 Mt according to Ashford et al. (2004). 
The larger banks in Ashford et al. (2004) are accompanied by 
signiﬁcantly lower emissions of CFC-11 and CFC-12 over the 
past 10 years, compared with the emissions reported in WMO 
(2003). The lower emissions cannot support the observations in 
the atmosphere – that is, they lead to global atmospheric con-
centrations about 40 ppt lower than those observed in 2002 for 
both CFC-11 and CFC-12. 
 
The uncertainty in the accumulated top-down emissions is 
estimated at about 3%, based on an estimated 2–3% uncertainty 
in observed concentrations by different measurement networks 
(see Table 2.1). Based on an inverse calculation, the accumu-
lated emissions for 1990–2001 needed to support the observa-
tions of CFC-11 and CFC-12 have an uncertainty of about 4%, 
assuming an uncertainty in the observed concentration trends of 
1%. The uncertainty in cumulative production is harder to esti-
mate. The total 1990–2001 production of CFC-11 and CFC-12 
in Ashford et al. (2004) is about 30–35% lower than in WMO 
(2003). This difference can be attributed largely to the neglect 
of production data not reported to AFEAS (2004) but which is 
included in UNEP production data. See Chapter 11 for a dis-
cussion of uncertainties in bottom-up emission estimates. But 
because the additional UNEP production is most likely used 
in rapid-release applications (Chapter 11), it does not change 
the size of the bank. Uncertainties in accumulated emission and 
production add up to the uncertainty in the change in the bank 
from 1990 to 2002.
  
The virtually zero bank of CFC-12 reported in WMO (2003) 
is not in agreement with Chapter 6 of this report because CFC-
12 is still present in current air conditioners. The banks of CFC-
11 and CFC-12 from WMO (2003) could therefore be a lower 
limit of the real banks, whereas those of Ashford et al. (2004) 
could be an upper limit.
 
As discussed in Section 2.5.3.2, the concept of ESSC can 
be used to estimate the indirect GWP for the ODSs. The best 
estimate of the year when EESC is projected to return to 1980 
values for the baseline scenario Ab of WMO (2003, Chapter 1) 
is 2043.9, if the banks of all ODSs are as estimated in WMO 
(2003, Chapter 1); if the banks of CFCs and HCFCs are as es-
timated in this report (see Ashford et al., 2004, and Chapters 4 
to 11), this date would be estimated to occur in the year 2046.4. 
Some emissions of banked CFCs (such as the slow emissions 
of CFC-11 from foams) could occur after ozone recovery. Such 
emissions would reduce the effect of the banks on ozone recov-
ery but would still contribute to the positive direct radiative forc-
ing as greenhouse gases. Thus the larger banks of some ODSs 
estimated in this report could lead to a maximum delay in ozone 
recovery of the order of two to three years compared with the 
baseline scenario. If no emissions occurred from the ODS banks 
as estimated in WMO (2003, Chapter 1), the date when EESC 
is estimated to return to its 1980 value is 2038.9, or an accelera-
tion of about ﬁve years. Finally, if emissions of all ODSs were 
stopped in 2003, the date when EESC is estimated to return to 
its 1980 value was given as 2033.8 in WMO (2003, Chapter 1), 
an acceleration of about ten years. Thus, these changes in fu-
ture ODS emissions, within ranges compatible with the present 
uncertainties in the banks, have relatively small effects on the 
time at which EESC recovers to 1980 levels and therefore on 
stratospheric ozone and the indirect radiative forcing of these 
gases. The uncertainties in the physical and chemical processes 
involved in the time of ozone recovery (as shown in the Figure 
in Box 1.7 in Chapter 1) are larger than the uncertainties in the 
scenarios associated with these alternative emissions.
2.6 
Impacts on air quality
2.6.1 
Scope of impacts
Halocarbons and their replacements may exert an impact on 
the composition of the troposphere and hence may inﬂuence air 
quality on global, regional and local scales. Air quality impacts 
of replacement compounds will depend on (1) their incremental 
emissions relative to the current and future emissions from oth-
er sources of these and other compounds that affect air quality, 
(2) their chemical properties, particularly the atmospheric re-
activity, which is inversely related to the atmospheric lifetime, 
and (3) for the more reactive compounds, the geographic and 
temporal distribution of their incremental emissions. 
 
This section provides a framework for evaluating the im-
pacts of halocarbons and their replacements on the global self-
cleaning capacity (Section 2.6.2) and on urban and regional air 
quality (Section 2.6.3). For the urban and regional scales in par-
ticular, such impacts are difﬁcult to assess because of many fac-
tors, including uncertainties in the relative spatial and temporal 
distributions of emission of different reactive compounds, non-
linear chemical interactions (especially in polluted regimes), 
and complex patterns of atmospheric mixing and transport. 
Therefore only the methodology for assessing these impacts is 
presented here. Although some numerical examples are provid-
ed, they are not intended as a prediction of future impacts, but 
only as an illustration of the methodology required to perform a 
full assessment of the effects of replacement compounds (e.g., 
through the use of reactivity indices, such as the Photochemical 
Ozone-Creation Potential, POCP, and the Maximum Incremental 
Reactivity, MIR) in the context of known local and regional 
emissions of all the other compounds that contribute to poor air

quality. Actual impacts will depend not only on the speciﬁc re-
placement compound being considered, but also on the current 
air quality and the prevailing meteorological conditions at any 
given location, as well as on a detailed knowledge of all other 
pollution sources. 
2.6.2 
Global-scale air quality impacts
Globally, organic compounds added to the troposphere can lead 
simultaneously to increased concentrations of tropospheric O3 
(a greenhouse gas) and to decreased concentrations of hydroxyl 
(OH) radicals. The resulting impacts on the global distributions 
of the greenhouse gases CH4 and O3 and their radiative forcing 
have already been discussed in Section 2.5, where they were 
quantiﬁed using the indirect GWP concept (see Table 2.8 for the 
GWP of short-lived hydrocarbons). Here we address more gen-
erally the potential impacts of halocarbons and their replace-
ments on the global distribution of OH concentrations. These 
concentrations are nearly synonymous with the tropospheric 
‘self-cleaning’ capacity because OH-initiated oxidation reac-
tions are a major mechanism for the removal of numerous trace 
gases, including CH4, NMHCs, nitrogen and sulphur oxides 
(NOx and SOx), as well as HFCs and HCFCs. 
 
A direct way to evaluate these impacts is to compare the 
consumption rate of OH radicals by halocarbons and their re-
placements with that by the current burden of trace gases such 
as CH4 and CO. For long-lived species, this comparison is 
straightforward because their concentrations are relatively uni-
form on the global scale. Table 2.9 lists the OH consumption 
rates for selected long-lived species. The rates are computed 
as k(OH+X)[X], where k(OH+X) is the rate constant for the reaction 
of substance X with OH, and [X] is its observed atmospheric 
concentration. For the purpose of obtaining an upper limit, 
the rate constants and concentrations are evaluated for surface 
conditions (1 atm, 287 K). For the CFCs, halons, HCFCs and 
HFCs shown in the table, the OH radical consumption rates 
are orders of magnitudes smaller than those of CH4 and CO. 
Similar estimates for many other CFCs, halons, HCFCs and 
HFCs, as well as the PFCs and HFEs, are not possible because 
of lack of measurements of their atmospheric concentrations or 
of their rate constant for reaction with OH. However, their OH 
consumption rates are expected to be small. CFCs, halons and 
PFCs are expected to react very slowly with OH because no H 
atom is available on these molecules for OH to abstract (see 
Section 2.4.1). For HFCs, the known OH reaction rate constants 
(0.02–3.2 × 10–14 cm3 molecule–1 s–1) are generally smaller than 
those of HCFCs (0.02–9.9 × 10–13 cm3 molecule–1 s–1), and their 
global mean concentrations are expected to be lower than those 
of HCFCs because of their shorter emission histories, so that 
the OH radical consumption rate of HFCs should be smaller 
than that of HCFCs. Thus, the OH radical consumption rates 
and consequently the impacts on global air quality of CFCs, 
HCFCs, halons, HFCs and PFCs, are not signiﬁcant compared 
to those of CH4 and CO. 
 
For short-lived compounds, such as volatile organic com-
pounds (VOCs), the impacts on global OH are more difﬁcult 
to estimate because of the large spatial and temporal variations 
in their concentrations, known chemical nonlinearities, and the 
complexity of transport and mixing of clean and polluted air. 
Although concentration measurements of many of these com-
pounds have been made in both polluted and clean environments, 
they are not sufﬁciently representative to estimate globally av-
eraged values. A crude estimate can be made by comparing 
the globally integrated emissions of anthropogenic VOCs with 
those of other gases that react with OH, especially CO, CH4 and 
natural (biogenic) VOCs. This comparison is premised on the 
approximation that all emitted VOCs are eventually removed 
by reaction with OH, so that the rate of consumption of OH is 
related stoichiometrically to the emission rate of any VOC. The 
globally integrated emissions of CO, CH4 and the VOCs are 
given in Table 2.10. Anthropogenic VOCs are a small fraction 
of the global reactive-carbon emissions, with total contributions 
of 2.1% on a per-mole basis and 6.1% on a per-carbon basis. 
The impact of increased emissions of any of the compounds 
listed in Table 2.10 can be estimated from the table. For ex-

ample, a doubling of the current emissions of butanes would 
increase the emissions of reactive carbon by about 0.5% (on the 
more conservative per-carbon basis), and is therefore unlikely 
to have a signiﬁcant impact on global OH concentrations. A 
similar argument can also be made for HFCs (see Table 2.10 for 
emissions), which currently account for a negligible fraction of 
the global reactive-carbon emissions.
 
The total molar emission rate of compounds that remove 
OH (summed from Table 2.10) is about 4 × 1013 mol yr–1 and is 
dominated by CO and CH4. By comparison, the molar emission 
rate of the major CFCs (CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-113) and 
of CCl4 at their maximum values in the late 1980s is estimated 
as about 8 × 109 mol yr–1. Substitution of these CFC emission 
rates by an equal number of moles of compounds that react with 
OH (e.g., VOCs) would increase the OH loss rate by only about 
0.02%.

This simple comparison neglects the nonlinear interactions 
that result from chemical and mixing processes involving dif-
ferent air masses, any non-OH removal processes (such as reac-
tions of some VOCs with O3), and the secondary reactions of 
OH with intermediates of VOC oxidation. The reactive inter-
mediates may be particularly important for the larger VOCs, 
making the comparisons of the relative OH consumption more 
conservative on a per-carbon rather than on a per-mole basis, 
but many of these intermediates are also believed to be scav-
enged by aerosols (Seinfeld and Pankow, 2003) rather than by 
OH. Regeneration of OH – for example, by the photolysis of 
H2O2 produced during VOC oxidation, or by NOx chemistry – is 
not considered, but would, in any case, reduce the impacts. In 
view of these uncertainties, the relative reactive-carbon emis-
sions should not be equated to the relative OH consumption 
rates, but may be useful in establishing whether incremental 
emissions could or could not be signiﬁcant. 
2.6.3 
Urban and regional air quality
2.6.3.1 
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
Organic compounds, in the presence of sunlight and NOx, take 
part in ground-level ozone formation and thereby contribute to 
the deterioration in regional and urban air quality, with adverse 
effects on human health and biomes. Each organic compound 
exhibits a different propensity to form ozone, which can be 
indexed in a reactivity scale. In North America, ground-level 
ozone formation is seen as an urban-scale issue and reactiv-
ity scales, such as the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) 
scale, describe the contributions by different organic com-
pounds to the intense photochemical ozone formation in urban 
plumes (Carter, 1994). In Europe, ground-level ozone forma-
tion occurs on the regional scale in multi-day episodes, and a 
different reactivity scale, the Photochemical Ozone Creation 
Potential (POCP), has been developed to address long-range 
transboundary formation and transport of ozone. These indices 
of reactivity are useful only if fully speciated organic emissions 
inventories are known. Such information is frequently available 
for European and North American locations, but is not gener-
ally available for cities and regions of less developed nations.
 
Table 2.11 presents the MIR scale for conditions appropriate 
to North America and the POCP scale for conditions appropri-
ate to Europe for a range of chemical species relevant to this re-
port. MIR values generally fall in the range from 0, unreactive, 
to about 15, highly reactive. POCP values cover the range from 
0, unreactive, to about 140, highly reactive. In general terms, 
the ODSs and HFCs in common use have very low MIR and 
POCP values and take no part in ground-level ozone formation. 
In contrast, the alkanes (ethane, propane and isobutane) and 
alkenes (ethylene and propylene) exhibit steadily increasing re-
activities from ethane, which is unreactive, to propylene, which 
is highly reactive. Alkanes have low reactivity on the urban 
scale and so have low MIR values. However, alkanes generate 
ozone efﬁciently on the multi-day scale and so appear much 
more reactive under European conditions on the POCP scale. 
On the basis of reactivity scales, it therefore appears that among 
all the proposed substances relevant to the phase-out of ODSs 
used in refrigeration, air conditioning and foam blowing sec-
tors, only alkenes, some alkanes and some oxygenated organics 
have the potential to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence ozone formation on 
the urban and regional scales. Substitutes for smaller sectors, 
such as aromatics and terpenes as solvents, are potentially more 
reactive but are not within the scope of this report.
Table 2.11. Propensity of VOCs to form tropospheric ozone accor-
ding to two reactivity scales: the Maximum Incremental Reactivity 
(MIR) for single-day urban plumes appropriate to North American 
conditions, and the Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) 
for multi-day regional ozone formation appropriate to European 
conditions.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
When it comes to assessing the possible impacts of the substitu-
tion of an ODS by an alkane or alkene, what needs to be con-
sidered is the reactivity-weighted mass emission involved with 
the substitution. Generally speaking such substitutions show 
relatively small impacts because there are already huge anthro-
pogenic urban sources of these particular alkanes and alkenes. 
 
Speciated VOCs inventories are required to calculate POCP 
values, and among European countries only the United Kingdom 
has such data. Table 2.12 shows the current POCP-weighted 
emissions of selected VOCs from all sources in the UK. It also 
shows the incremental POCP-weighted emission from the re-
placement of 1 kt yr–1 mass emission of these compounds with 
an equal mass of HFC-134a, which illustrates the use of POCP 
values for estimating impacts on regional ozone: Consider a hy-
pothetical replacement of HFC-134a by any of the compounds 
listed in Table 2.12. The POCP for HFC-134a is 0.1 (see Table 
2.11), so that substitution of 1 kt yr–1 of HFC-134a by an equal 
mass of VOCs will lead to an increase in POCP-weighted emis-
sions as shown in the third column of Table 2.12, and there-
fore to some deterioration in regional ozone-related air quality. 
For a few organic compounds, such as ethylene and propylene, 
such substitutions of HFC-134a would increase POCP-weight-
ed emissions by three orders of magnitude. However, there are 
already large sources of these compounds in UK emissions, so 
the increase in POCP-weighted emissions from the substitution 
is small compared with the current POCP-weighted emissions 
from all other sources, as is shown in the comparison between 
the third and fourth columns of Table 2.12. There are a few spe-
cies for which the substitution of 1 kt yr–1 of HFC-134a would 
lead to an increase in POCP-weighted emissions that are large 
Table 2.12. The change in POCP-weighted emissions in the UK following the hypothetical substitution of a 1 kt yr–1 emission of HFC-134a by

in comparison with current emissions; these species include 
dimethyl ether, methylene chloride, methyl chloride and me-
thyl formate. However, these species tend to have relatively low 
ozone production capacities, so the impact on air quality of the 
increase in POCP-weighted emissions from the substitution of 
HFC-134a is likely to be insigniﬁcant.
 
Table 2.13 illustrates the use of the MIR scale for the Mexico 
City Metropolitan Area, which represents one of the worst air 
pollution cases in the world and is the only city in the develop-
ing world that has the speciated inventory required for MIR cal-
culations. These estimates were obtained from a hydrocarbon 
source-apportionment study (Vega et al., 2000) using a chemi-
cal mass-balance receptor model applied to measurements at 
three sites, and using the current emission estimate reported for 
total VOCs as 433,400 t yr–1 (SMA-GDF, 2003). As can be seen 
from the table, the introduction of 1 kt yr–1 of a particular hydro-
carbon to substitute for, say, 1 kt yr–1 of HFC-134a, is negligible 
in comparison with the current MIR-weighted emission rates of 
all VOCs. 
 
Table 2.14 presents a similar calculation for the Los Angeles 
area (South Coast Air Basin). Speciated emissions were report-
ed by Harley and Cass (1995) for the summer of 1987. More 
recent speciated emissions are not available in the scientiﬁc lit-
erature, but it should be noted that total emissions of reactive 
organic carbon (ROG) have decreased by a factor of about 2.2 
from 1985 to 2000 (Alexis et al., 2003). 
 
Non-speciated VOC emission inventories are becoming 
available for other regions of the world. Although MIR- and 
POCP-based reactivity estimates are not possible without de-
tailed speciation, the total VOC emissions are generally much 
larger than those anticipated from ODS replacements. For ex-
ample, Streets et al. (2003) have estimated that the total non-
methane VOC emissions from all major anthropogenic sources, 
including biomass burning, in 64 regions in Asia was 52.2 Tg in 
2000, with 30% of these emissions from China. In Europe, ur-
ban, industrial and agricultural emissions are a major concern, 
and the national VOC emission ceiling in the EU is expected 
to be 6.5 Mt in 2010 (EC, 2001). However, the 1990 annual 
total VOC emissions for Europe were estimated to be 22 Mt, 
according to the recent European ‘CityDelta’ study. The study 
was conceived in support of the CAFE (Clean Air For Europe) 
programme on EU environmental legislation related to NOx, 
VOCs and particulate matter, organized by the Joint Centre 
of the European Commission – Institute for Environment and 
Sustainability (JRC-IES). CityDelta is focused on exploring 
changes in air quality in eight cities (London, Paris, Prague, 
Berlin, Copenhagen, Katowice, Milan and Marseille) in sev-
en countries caused by changes in emissions as predicted by 
atmospheric models (Thunis and Cuvelier, 2004). Table 2.15 
shows the total anthropogenic VOC emissions for CityDelta 
Project countries observed in 1990 and 2000, and projected for 
2010. 
 
Global estimates of incremental emissions of VOCs used as 
replacement compounds cannot be used directly to estimate re-
gional and local air quality impacts. These impacts depend also 
on the reactivity of the selected replacement compounds and 
on how their incremental emissions are distributed geographi-
cally and in time (e.g., seasonally). Such detailed information is 
Table 2.14. The change in MIR-weighted emissions in the Los Angeles area following the hypothetical substitution of a 1 kt yr–1 emission of 
HFC-134a by the emission of 1 kt yr–1 of each species. Also shown are the 1987 MIR-weighted emissions in kt yr–1 from all sources.

not normally available and therefore several additional assump-
tions need to be made. For illustration, consider (as in Section 
2.6.2) the global replacement of the major CFCs emissions 
at their maximum values in the late 1980s (of about 8 × 109 
mol yr–1) by an equal number of moles of a single compound, 
isobutane. The corresponding global isobutane emission incre-
ment is about 460 kt yr–1, representing a 3.5% increase over its 
current global emissions (see Table 2.10). Regional and local 
increments can, however, be substantially larger, depending on 
how these emissions are distributed. If additional assumptions 
are made that the incremental emissions have no seasonal vari-
ation and are distributed spatially according to population, the 
increments would be about 4.6 kt yr–1 for the UK (approximate 
population 60 million), 1.5 kt yr–1 for Mexico City (approxi-
mate population 20 million) and 1.15 kt yr–1 for the Los Angeles 
area (approximate population 15 million). The POCP-weighted 
isobutane emission increment for the UK would then be 143 
kt yr–1, which is 11% of the current isobutane emissions in the 
UK but only 0.6% of the total POCP-weighted VOC emissions 
shown in Table 2.12. Similarly, for other European countries the 
current and future VOC emissions (see Table 2.15) are much 
larger than this hypothetical population-weighted increment 
in isobutane emissions. For Mexico City, the MIR-weighted 
isobutane increment would be 2.0 kt yr–1, which is 25% of the 
current isobutane emission but 0.1% of the total MIR-weight-
ed VOC emissions shown in Table 2.13. For Los Angeles, the 
MIR-weighted isobutane increment would be 1.5 kt yr–1, which 
is 10% of the 1987 isobutane emission but 0.07% of the total 
MIR-weighted VOC emissions shown in Table 2.14. Even con-
sidering the substantial reductions in VOC emissions in recent 
years (Alexis et al., 2003), it is clear that such isobutane incre-
ments would increase total MIR-weighted VOC emissions by 
less than 1%. However, even such small increases in reactivity 
may be of some concern in urban areas that currently fail to 
meet air quality standards.
2.6.3.2 
Ammonia (NH3)
Gaseous ammonia (NH3) is an important contributor to the 
mass of atmospheric aerosols, where it exists primarily as am-
monium sulphate and ammonium nitrate (Seinfeld and Pandis, 
1998). Recent evidence also suggests that NH3 may promote 
the formation of new sulphate particles (Weber et al., 1999). 
NH3 is removed relatively rapidly (within a few days) from 
the atmosphere mostly by dry deposition and rain-out, and to a 
lesser extent by gas-phase reaction with OH (see Section 2.4.4). 
Incremental emissions of NH3 from its use as a replacement for 
ODSs must be considered in the context of the uncertain current 
local, regional and global NH3 emissions. 
 
Most of the anthropogenic emissions of NH3 result from 
agricultural activities (livestock, fertilizer use, crops and crop 
decomposition), biomass burning, human waste and fossil-fuel 
combustion. Together with contributions from natural sources, 
such as the oceans, natural soils and natural vegetation, the total 
(1990) global emission of NH3 was 54 MtN yr–1, of which about 
80% was anthropogenic (FAO, 2001). Spatially distributed (1° 
× 1°) emissions inventories have been developed by Bouwman 
et al. (1997) and Van Aardenne et al. (2001), and are available 
from the Global Emissions Inventory Activity (GEIA, www.
geiacenter.org) and EDGAR2.0 (Olivier et al., 1996) databas-
es. 
 
For Europe, the 1990 annual total anthropogenic NH3 emis-
sions were estimated to be 5.7 Mt, with an average emission 
per capita of 12 kg (11 kg per capita in the EU) (CORINAIR, 
1996). European NH3 emissions have decreased by 14% be-
tween 1990 and 1998 (Erisman et al., 2003). Anthropogenic 
emissions of NH3 for 1990 and 2000 in the CityDelta Project 
countries are summarized in Table 2.16, together with the 2010 
projection. According to the table, total ammonia emissions 
have decreased by 6–52% between 1990 and 2000, with the 
largest reductions (140 kt yr–1) occurring in Germany, primarily 
because of the fall in livestock numbers and the decreasing use 
of mineral nitrogen fertilizers.
 
Incremental NH3 emissions from substitution of ODSs are 
expected to be small on a global basis. For example, the equi-
molar substitution of the major CFCs (CFC-11, CFC-12 and 
CFC-113) and of CCl4 at their maximum emission rates in the 
late 1980s would require about 140 kt yr–1 of NH3, or a 0.2% in-
crease in global emissions. If this global increase in NH3 emis-
sions is distributed geographically according to population, the 
additional national and regional emissions would be negligible 
compared with current emissions (see for example Table 2.16). 
However, larger local impacts could result from highly local-
ized NH3 release episodes.
Table 2.16. Anthropogenic emissions of NH3 (in kt yr–1) in the City-
Delta Project countries (UN-ECE, 2003).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The phase out of CFCs and HCFCs under the Montreal Protocol 
requires the selection of replacement technologies, and in many 
cases are these alternative ﬂuids. These technologies have dif-
fering impacts on global climate change, health, safety and 
other environmental endpoints, and different private and so-
cial costs. Analyses that focus on one or more of these types 
of impacts can help decision-makers to make choices about 
competing replacement technologies. However the outcomes 
of such analyses are inﬂuenced by many factors not intrinsic 
to the technologies. Examples of these are the analytical ap-
proach (e.g., top-down compared with bottom-up), the degree 
of product or process optimization, service and disposal prac-
tices, regional circumstances and a wealth of other inputs and 
assumptions. Therefore in order to make informed choices, de-
cision-makers need to be aware of the sensitivities, uncertain-
ties and limitations inherent in each type of analysis, and must 
be able to evaluate whether the approach and assumptions used 
in an analysis are reasonable for the regions and time periods in 
which the competing technologies are to be applied.
 
The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the 
different types of analyses as well as concise guidance on how 
to evaluate and apply these. For each type of analysis, the most 
important analytical approaches and variables are discussed, 
along with the associated sensitivities, uncertainties and limi-
tations. The requirements and limitations of each method are 
explained. This provides a point of reference for the selection 
of assessment methods in the technical chapters of this report 
and gives a framework which helps to harmonize the reporting 
of results. Further the chapter provides an introduction to the 
technical chapters and to their subsequent application, non-ap-
plication and speciﬁc-default macrodata. A description of the 
key methods used in these chapters is also given. 
 
An overview is given of the key approaches used to compare 
the lifetime, and the direct and indirect emissions of different 
types of systems. These range from the modelling of partial or 
complete systems to measured values of individual systems or 
of representative equipment populations. There can be signiﬁ-
cant differences between the results from different approaches 
and therefore relevant policy comparisons can only be made if 
there is maximum transparency and a harmonization of assump-
tions. Reference values for emissions from energy consumption 
in the production of ﬂuids and products are given along with 
values for CO2 emissions from electricity generation for the 
national electricity grids. These values differ signiﬁcantly over 
time and between regions, suggesting that great care should be 
taken if results of system comparisons based on total equivalent 
warming impact (TEWI) or Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are 
transferred to related applications or other regions.
 
In any economic analysis, the cost of mitigation is cal-
culated as the difference in costs (deﬁned in monetary units) 
between a reference situation and a new one characterized by 
lower emissions. Both situations should, as far as possible, be 
deﬁned such that the assessment can include all major econom-
ic and social impacts of the policies and the resulting impact 
on greenhouse-gas emissions. At the project level, the simplest 
cost assessment using cost-beneﬁt analysis considers that a new 
technology requires capital investment to cover costs accounted 
in the project. Major categories of costs accounted in a project 
are labour, land, material, energy, investments, environmental 
services and foreign exchange. These costs are known as the 
direct engineering and ﬁnancial costs. A more complete cost 
evaluation requires the inclusion of externalities, the costs not 
paid directly by the private commercial entity developing the 
project. External costs are paid by society and where available, 
these should be considered for wider policy assessments. In 
principle, the total cost to society (social cost) consists of both 
the external cost and the private cost. For the assessment of en-
gineering-type measures relevant to this report, the focus is best 
placed on private costs, expressed in terms of their net present 
value (NPV) or as levelized costs to account for the time distri-
bution of costs and investments during the project lifetime. 
 
Health and safety issues are an integral aspect of decisions 
concerning the choice of ﬂuids. These decisions can have far-
reaching consequences for the workforce, the population, in-
dustry, the environment and the economy. The prevention of 
negative health and safety impacts requires methodologies such 
as risk assessment, risk management, and policy and regula-
tory controls. Health and safety issues are considered under the 
following criteria: Flammability, acute toxicity, chronic toxic-
ity, carcinogenicity, acute ecotoxicity, chronic ecotoxicity, and 
persistence. Information on the substances covered by this re-
port was drawn from several sources. The technical chapters 
provide detailed information on the substances and the prod-
ucts these are used in is provided in the subsequent technical 
chapters. The information is divided into general characteristics 
of a group of ﬂuids followed by typical characteristics of cer-
tain ﬂuids within the group. There are signiﬁcant differences 
between the various ﬂuid groups, and in some cases within the 
ﬂuid groups, with respect to ﬂammability, acute toxicity, eco-
toxicity and persistence. The design of systems and processes 
should reﬂect the speciﬁc weaknesses of the ﬂuids used. 
 
A fairly wide range of assessment methods is described so 
that the impacts of different technologies on the environment 
and climate can be compared and understood. One signiﬁcant 
problem identiﬁed is that methodologies like LCA and TEWI 
are installation-speciﬁc and therefore do not provide meaningful 
results for entire sectors. It is also demonstrated that the avail-
able assessment methodologies are not generic but have been 
developed for a speciﬁc purpose. Each of the methodologies 
can play a role in technology choices if used appropriately.
 
The use of ﬂuorocarbons is speciﬁc to certain technical 
sectors. In these sectors, technology selection and product de-
velopment are inﬂuenced by the customers and a number of 
other factors, such as the enforcement of legislation, of a local, 
national or regional nature. An overview of the regional fac-
tors that should be reﬂected in the inputs for analyses is given. 
These factors include climate, labour costs, the availability of 
capital, skilled labour and spare parts, the replacement rates of

systems, and disposal pathways. In this section a regional par-
titioning of developed and developing countries is used accord-
ing to the Montreal Protocol.
  
For applications involving banked amounts of ﬂuids, an 
overview is given of the available approaches and associated 
uncertainties for the modelling of process emissions compared 
to emissions in the usage phase and upon disposal. For both 
areas, the future usage pattern and emissions can be estimated 
using bottom-up and top-down approaches. The former ideally 
involves the modelling of the emissions of individual substanc-
es or substance classes from populations of equipment. The 
properties of these pieces of equipment will often be modelled 
differently for different years and in different regions so as to 
reﬂect anticipated technological changes. In contrast to these 
technology-rich approaches, top-down models rely on histori-
cally established relations between sales into certain sectors 
and economic growth. This approach is typically weakest in 
capturing long-term technological changes but is good for the 
appropriate capture of mid- to long-term growth and wealth ef-
fects. However for technologies involving the use of ﬂuorinated 
greenhouse gases, uncertainties associated with both bottom-up 
and top-down models become so signiﬁcant that projections be-
yond the year 2020 are unreliable. 
 
In the past, too little attention was paid to ensuring the com-
parability and transferability of results from different technol-
ogy assessments. The treatment of uncertainties is often incom-
plete and therefore the resulting recommendations are often not 
robust enough to be transferred across a sector. To address these 
concerns, analysts and decision-makers should ensure, wherev-
er possible, that the assumptions and methods used to compare 
competing technologies are consistent and that uncertainties and 
sensitivities are identiﬁed and quantiﬁed. The development of 
simple and pragmatic standard methodologies and the respec-
tive quality criteria should be continued. It is recommended that 
future efforts should focus on increasing the involvement of rel-
evant stakeholders and introducing additional measures to in-
crease transparency for outside users, for example by providing 
more extensive documentation. For certain regions and policy 
questions the amount of resources needed for some of the as-
sessment methods is prohibitive. There is a need for simple and 
pragmatic assessment methods that can also be used in regions 
with very limited resources.

3.1 
Introduction
This chapter provides public and corporate decision-makers 
with an overview of assessment methodologies that can be used 
to support informed decisions on technologies to replace the 
use of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). Such decisions are 
taken in the context of the phase out of ozone-depleting sub-
stances under the Montreal Protocol, and national and interna-
tional policies aimed at reducing emissions of anthropogenic 
greenhouse gases. The latter include not only direct emissions 
of ﬂuids during production, use and disposal but also energy-
related emissions over the lifetime of products and equipment. 
Decisions on technology choices and the deﬁnition of appro-
priate practices will often take place at the level of individual 
projects but could also be important in designing policies. This 
chapter has therefore been designed as a toolbox for decision-
makers. The intention is to give an overview of the most com-
mon assessment methodologies for evaluating competing tech-
nologies, including a description of how these are applied and 
their practical limitations. It also provides information used by 
several subsequent chapters in this report.
 
Fluorinated substances such as hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs) 
and perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs) are being widely used or are be-
ing considered for future use as refrigerants, blowing agents 
in foam production, propellants for aerosol applications, sol-
vents, surfactants, ﬁre-ﬁghting agents and anaesthetics. These 
substances are used in many technical applications over a wide 
range of conditions. They are replacing the use of CFCs and 
HCFCs, which were and are being banned due to their signiﬁ-
cant impact as ODSs. In quantitative terms, stationary refrig-
eration and air conditioning, mobile air conditioning and foam 
blowing dominate usage and emissions in most countries.
 
As these substances are potent greenhouse gases, consid-
erable efforts are underway to reduce the emissions of these 
from products or processes to well below the levels that can be 
obtained on the basis of current technical and economic drivers. 
The principal available emission reduction options − over the 
lifetime of the product equipment − for the aforementioned ap-
plications fall into ﬁve main groups: 
a) Improved containment of ﬂuorinated gases during the 
life cycle of a product or system (manufacture, use and 
decommissioning/disposal);
b) Use of technologies with a lower ﬂuid charge;
c) Use of alternative ﬂuids with a zero/low global-warming 
potential (GWP);
d) Use of not-in-kind (NIK) technologies;
e) Process modiﬁcations to avoid byproduct formation or 
emission.
The beneﬁts of reducing emissions of ﬂuorinated gases clearly 
need to be offset against potential changes in terms of energy 
efﬁciency, safety and costs or the impact on environmental cat-
egories such as air quality and the continuation of damage to the 
ozone layer (see Figure 3.1). The speciﬁc details of a sector − or 
even the application concerned − need to be taken into account 
when making decisions about technological options. 
 
As a result of international concerted action, many of the 
sectors and applications covered in this report have undergone 
a rapid transition away from the use of ODSs. This mandated 
transition has also led to a signiﬁcant increase in knowledge 
about technological alternatives to the use of ODSs and has re-
sulted in increased innovation. This high rate of innovation has 
made it more difﬁcult to appropriately characterize technology 
options and then to assess them in terms of their performance 
or costs. Therefore it is now more important than ever to ap-
ply consistent methodologies, as outlined in this chapter, for 
the purpose of producing valid comparisons upon which robust 
technology choices can be based.
 
The subsequent sections of this chapter cover the following 
aspects of technology assessment relevant to the sectors using 
ﬂuorinated gases: Key performance characteristics such as di-
rect and indirect emissions (3.2), categories of costs (3.3), con-
sideration of health and safety issues (3.4), assessment of cli-
mate and environmental impacts (3.5), regional dimensions of 
technology choices (3.6), basics of emission projections (3.7) 
and future methodological developments (3.8). 
3.2 
Direct and indirect emissions
This section considers aspects related to emissions from prod-
ucts and equipment using HFCs or PFCs. Direct and indirect 
emissions need to be identiﬁed to account for the full inven-
tory of such emissions. Indirect emissions are usually associ-
ated with the amount of energy consumed for the operation of 
equipment loaded with the ﬂuid. Table 3.1 gives an overview 
of the relative contribution of direct HFC emissions to the total 
greenhouse-gas emissions associated with systems, for exam-
ple, a domestic refrigerator, a refrigerated truck, a supermarket 
cooling system or the energy losses through an insulated area 
of building surface. The table shows that for several important 
technical systems (e.g. mobile air conditioners or supermarket 
refrigeration) direct and indirect emissions are of the same or-
der of magnitude but that for several other applications, energy-
related indirect emissions outweigh direct emissions by one or 
two orders of magnitude. The methodologies stated in Table 3.1 
are described in greater detail in Section 3.5. Speciﬁc values are 
highly dependent on emission factors, end-of-life treatment of 
equipment, the GWP of the ﬂuids used and the carbon intensity 
of the energy supply system. 
3.1.1 
Direct emissions
Emissions are possible throughout the lifetime of the ﬂuid, 
from the initiation of ﬂuid manufacture through use within the 
intended equipment, to its destruction. The following paragraphs 
describe key stages within the lifetime of the ﬂuid where direct 
emissions occur. The identiﬁcation of emissions from these 
various stages is necessary for both the environmental impact 
and safety assessments of applications that use any type of 
ﬂuid.

3.2.1.1 
Emissions by ﬂuid life stage 
Fluid manufacture 1
The manufacture of ﬂuids requires feedstock materials, 
which are sourced, produced and used worldwide. Emissions 
from these feedstock materials, their intermediates and the 
end substance can occur in chemical processing plants. For 
the production of many HFCs, these direct emissions can be 
signiﬁcant in terms of CO2 equivalent (on a GWP(100) basis 
– see Section 3.5.1). For example, the substances emitted 
during the production of HFC-227ea were estimated to amount 
to 120 kg CO2-eq kg-1 of material manufactured (Banks et al., 
1998), whereas for HFC-134a this ﬁgure was relatively low 
with estimates ranging from 2−40 kg CO2-eq kg-1. (McCulloch 
and Lindley, 2003 and Banks and Sharratt, 1996, respectively). 
These values are strongly dependent on the ﬂuid manufacturing 
process and the integrity of the chemical plant. The good 
design and operation of the plant can lead to lower emissions. It 
should be noted that some of the intermediate substances might 
be ODSs (although these are converted into the end product 
without being emitted). For example CFC-114a, HCFC-133 
and HFCF-124 are used in particular routes for the manufacture 
of HFC-134a (Frischknecht, 1999). The emissions of GHGs are 
signiﬁcantly less for alternative ﬂuids. HC-290, HC-600a and 
HC-1270 are generally extracted from natural gas mixtures and 
leakage from the process plant will generally comprise a variety 
of hydrocarbons. Gover et al. (1996) estimate 0.14 kg CO2, 0.5 
g HC and 0.7 g methane emissions per kg of propane/butane, 
which equates to 0.2 kg CO2-eq kg-1, and data from Frischknecht 
(1999) are lower than this. Ammonia is normally produced from 
natural gas and emissions of GHGs will only comprise methane 
and CO2. Frischknecht (1999) estimates between 1.5 and 2.3 
kg CO2 kg-1 ammonia produced, consistent with the value in 
Campbell and McCulloch (1998). CO2 is a slightly different 
case, as commodity CO2 is generally a recovered byproduct 
from numerous other chemical manufacturing processes and it 
is therefore difﬁcult to speciﬁcally attribute emissions to CO2. 
Frischknecht (1999) reports emissions of CO2 and methane, 
equivalent to 0.2 kg CO2 kg-1 CO2 produced. 
Distribution of ﬂuids
Once manufactured, ﬂuids can be shipped nationally or 
internationally, often as bulk shipment or in individual cylinders. 
Typically, national or regionally organized distribution chains 
deliver bulk quantities to product manufacturers or transfer the 
substances into smaller containers for use by manufacturers 
and service companies, in the case of refrigerants and solvents. 
The distribution chain stops when the substance enters into the 
management or control of the ‘user’, such as a manufacturer or 
a service company. Losses normally occur during the transfer 
of ﬂuids, connection and disconnection of hoses, and leakage 
from containers and pressure relief devices. These losses tend 
to be relatively small in relation to the large quantities of 
materials handled (Banks et al., 1998), as transfer operations 
take place under carefully-controlled conditions and are subject 
to international regulations for the prevention of releases (e.g. 
UN, 2002; IMO, 2000).
Manufacture and distribution of products
HFCs and alternative ﬂuids are generally used in the manufacture 
of refrigeration systems, foams, aerosols and ﬁre protection 
equipment, whereas solvent applications (e.g. cleaning) tend 
to apply ﬂuids directly on-site during the in-use stage. The 
manufacture of refrigeration products requires transfer of 
the ﬂuid. Losses normally occur due to the connection and 
disconnection of hoses and valves. Emissions also originate 
from storage vessels and the associated piping, but these are 
less frequent. 
 
Some sources of emissions are speciﬁc to certain applications 
and products. For example, refrigerants are often used to rinse 
out air, moisture and other contaminants from refrigeration 
equipment to ensure internal cleanliness prior to charging. 
Moreover, the refrigerant may also be employed as a tracer 
for the detection of leaks. Equipment leaks may be found after 
charging of the refrigerant, in which case further emissions 
will occur during the recovery and evacuation process prior to 
repairing the leaks. During the manufacture of foams, ﬂuids are 
used as blowing agents. The blowing-agent emissions during 
the preparation of foam formulations, when the blowing agent 
is mixed with other raw materials such as polyols, are low due 
to the use of closed systems. Depending on the type of foam

and process, either a small fraction (rigid closed cell foam) or 
the entire blowing agent (ﬂexible open cell foam) is emitted 
during the manufacturing process. The foaming usually takes 
place under ambient atmospheric conditions. The blowing agent 
emitted from the foaming process mixes with the air and is then 
vented or incinerated. Aerosols are generally charged in factory 
premises and, as for refrigerating systems, the disconnection of 
charging heads results in small releases. Cleaning machinery is 
occasionally ﬁlled with solvent, although emissions tend to be 
minimal at this stage because ﬂuids with a low vapour pressure 
are generally used.
Use 
The in-use stage of the product lifetime tends to result in the 
greatest emissions for most applications, particularly for re-
frigeration, aerosols, solvents and ﬁre protection systems. For 
refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, for example, in-use 
emissions can vary widely depending on the service and dis-
posal practices as well as other operational and environmental 
factors not intrinsic to the technology. Emissions from domes-
tic, commercial and industrial refrigerating equipment gener-
ally originate from failures in system components or from 
the handling of refrigerant during servicing, with the size and 
frequency of leaks depending upon several factors. External 
factors include usage patterns, frequency of equipment reloca-
tion, weathering and aggressive environments, repair quality 
and frequency of preventative maintenance. Rapid ﬂuctuations 
of temperature or pressure and excessive vibration of piping, 
joints and so forth, due to fan motors and compressors or other 
external sources are major causes of in-use leakage. Other in-
tegral aspects are associated with the design and construction 
of the equipment. The design quality of the equipment and the 
use of suitable components have a signiﬁcant impact on leak-
age rates. Control systems are also responsible for emissions, 
such as pressure-relief devices. Most industry guidance on 
emissions focuses on leak prevention for the in-use stage (e.g., 
see Institute of Refrigeration, 1995; Butler, 1994; ETSU, 1997). 
The multiple factors contributing to emissions of refrigerant 
often lead to a fairly broad distribution of net leakage rates for 
individual pieces of equipment. Figure 3.2 shows an example

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
from a survey carried out on mobile air-conditioning systems 
in Europe (Schwarz and Harnisch, 2003). A similar distribution 
is seen with supermarket systems (Radford, 1998). It is clear 
that the mean leakage rate for an equipment population can 
result from a broad distribution that includes many very tight, 
a large number of fairly tight and a small number of very leaky 
systems.
 
Decision-makers should realise that, in general, a leakage 
rate is not necessarily intrinsic to a certain technology but 
can also strongly depend on a number of environmental and 
operational factors. If properly understood, these factors can be 
systematically inﬂuenced to reduce emission levels. Whilst the 
quality of maintenance and repairs to equipment inﬂuence the 
leakage during operation, the actual handling of refrigerant may 
also lead to signiﬁcant emissions, for example the removal of 
ﬂuid from a system and the subsequent recharge. The degree of 
leakage is strongly dependent on the behaviour of the personnel 
and the tools they use, and will range from the minimum (that 
associated with residual gas within hoses and the system) up to 
quantities exceeding the system charge. Despite the legislation 
against venting in a number of countries, practices frequently 
prevail in which the whole system is vented, leak-tested with 
the ﬂuid (possibly several times until all leaks are repaired) and 
ﬂushed with the ﬂuid before ﬁnal recharging. Poorly connected 
hoses and ﬁttings, and poor-quality recovery equipment can 
signiﬁcantly contribute to high emissions. 
 
The majority of emissions from aerosols, ﬁre protection sys-
tems and solvents also occur during the in-use stage, although 
these are intentional since a release is part of the functional-
ity of the equipment. Emissions from aerosols are simply a 
function of the amount of propellant used. Fire protection sys-
tems produce emissions upon demand, as is the intention, al-
though undesired emissions occur from false alarms or faulty 
signals, or from mandatory system qualiﬁcation tests that re-
quire full system discharge. Sometimes training also involves 
the operation of the ﬁre protection system. Within the use 
phase of certain applications, such as ﬁre protection systems, 
equipment servicing and maintenance may require the removal 
of ﬂuid from a system and subsequent recharge, and emissions 
associated with this. Fire protection systems also exhibit slow 
passive emissions throughout the in-use stage, particularly in 
the case of high-pressure cylinder systems. Similarly systems 
that are being maintained can produce signiﬁcant emissions 
if the system is accidentally initiated, or when servicing of 
the systems requires checking and conﬁrmation of operation. 
Processes that use solvents generally lead to emissions as a 
result of residual ﬂuid evaporation of treated items, and to a 
lesser extent whenever equipment is opened as part of its use. 
 
Annual emissions from foams are generally minor during 
the in-use stage. The blowing agent in closed cell foams is 
released over time and typically only part of the blowing agent/
insulant will be released during the useful life of the product. 
Caleb (2000) has calculated emission factors for different 
rigid foams based on a survey and the collection of data from 
emission factors reported in the literature. Lee and Mutton 
(2004) recently did the same for extruded polystyrene or XPS 
foam. 
Decommissioning
Fluids may be vented or recovered during the decommissioning 
of refrigeration equipment, unexpelled ﬁre protection systems 
and equipment using solvents. Over the past decade the price 
of recovery equipment has fallen signiﬁcantly and the sales of 
such equipment have expanded, indicating that recovery has 
become much more widespread than was the case during the 
1980s and ﬁrst half of the 1990s. Blowing agents from foams 
and propellant from aerosols can also be recovered at end-of-
life, but current methods have a low effectiveness. Emission 
levels of refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, and of 
foam applications are very sensitive to disposal practices.
 
For refrigerants, ﬂuids from ﬁre protection systems and 
solvents, the sources of emissions associated with removal 
at end-of-life are the same as those associated with normal 
handling, as discussed previously for the servicing aspect during 
the in-use stage. Fluids used to be vented when equipment was 
decommissioned but where legislation has been introduced, the 
expected practice is to recover the ﬂuid. If the ﬂuid is recovered, 
it may be re-used (in its recovered form), recycled (using on-site 
machinery) or taken back to the supplier or recycling centre for 
cleaning (and re-use) or disposal. Uncontaminated ﬂuids can 
normally be reused and whether a ﬂuid can be cleaned on-site 
or has to be returned to the supplier, depends on the type and 
degree of contamination and the process needed to return it to the 
purity of virgin ﬂuid. However, in many situations, the resources

required to clean up contaminated refrigerant rarely outweigh 
the risks and beneﬁts to the service company. Therefore in most 
countries recovery rates have remained low if the chemical 
to be recovered is relatively inexpensive. Some suppliers or 
governments (e.g. Australia) have introduced cash incentives 
for the return of ‘minimally-contaminated’ refrigerant, but the 
success rate of such schemes is still unknown.
 
In the case of rigid insulating foams, the majority of 
blowing agents remain in the foam until end-of-life. Some rigid 
insulating foams such as ‘board stock’ and ‘sandwich panels’ 
can be recovered or re-used if they are not adhered to substrates 
or can be easily separated from these. A similar approach can be 
used with aerosol cans that contain residual propellant, although 
this procedure is not normally used. 
Disposal 
Following the recovery, and potentially recycling and 
reclamation, of refrigeration equipment, ﬂuids meant for 
disposal are stored ready for destruction. The handling and 
storage of refrigerants and ﬁre protection system ﬂuids, solvents 
and recovered aerosol propellants prior to destruction can lead 
to emissions in the same way as in the distribution of ﬂuids 
stage.
 
In the case of rigid insulating foams, the disposal is 
complicated because the foams are only a small part of overall 
systems such as a refrigerator or a building. Refrigerator foams 
can be shredded and incinerated to destroy all blowing agents. 
Alternatively they can be sent to landﬁlls, where the blowing 
agents will slowly be emitted and/or decompose (Kjeldsen and 
Scheutz, 2003). 
In general, destruction by incineration produces a small 
amount of emissions (of the original material). Destruction (or 
destruction and recovery) efﬁciencies are typically between 
99% and 99.99%, resulting in 0.1−10 g released per kg of 
material (UNEP-TEAP, 2002). Gases such as CO2, resulting 
from the combustion of fuel and ﬂuid, are also emitted. 
3.2.1.2 
Types of emission
Table 3.2 identiﬁes the types of emission common to the various 
applications in the subsequent technical chapters. These can be 
categorized into four general groups. Mitigation of emissions 
for each category requires attention for a particular process 
within the life of the equipment: Material selection (passive), 
mechanical design/construction (rupture), technician training 
(handling) and usage patterns (intentional/functional).
Passive
Passive emissions are generally small, ‘seeping’ leaks that oc-
cur constantly and are normally the result of permeation through 
construction materials and metal fatigue. This applies in par-
ticular to refrigerants, ﬁre protection system ﬂuids and aero-
sols when materials gasket, plastics and elastomers for seals 
and hosing are used. Emissions are minimized by selecting the 
correct materials for the ﬂuids used. In making this choice, the 
inﬂuence of other ﬂuids within the mixture such as refrigera-
tion oils and aerosol fragrances, which can affect permeability, 
should also be considered. In rigid insulating foams, the passive 
emission of blowing agents occurs through diffusion. The dif-
fusion coefﬁcients of HFCs through the rigid insulating foams 
vary considerably, dependent on the type of blowing agent. 
The use of non-permeable facer materials such as aluminium 
foils and metal skins can signiﬁcantly reduce the diffusion of 
blowing agents. Passive emissions typically occur throughout 
all stages of the ﬂuid and foam life, but as they are relatively 
constant, they predominate during the in-use stage.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Rupture 
Ruptures are accidental breaks in pressure systems, such 
as fractures in pipework, vessels and components. These 
are normally associated with ﬂuids under high pressure and 
therefore tend to occur throughout most stages of the ﬂuid life. 
Ruptures can result from external forces applied to components, 
inherent material weaknesses, the inﬂuence of pressure and 
temperature changes, vibration, the ageing of materials and 
corrosion. Large ruptures are generally the most notable type of 
leaks and tend to cause rapid and often complete release of the 
ﬂuid. Rupture leaks or emissions do not apply to foam because 
the pressure differential within and outside the foams is very 
small. Ruptures can be minimized by appropriately designing 
piping and components to account for anticipated stresses, 
protecting against external impact and avoiding a chemically 
aggressive environment. 
Handling 
Handling emissions are unintentional releases that occur 
with human intervention, for example, where a ﬂuid is being 
transferred into or out of equipment and complete recovery 
is impractical. Residual amounts of ﬂuid occur in transfer 
hoses, within components and systems following recovery, 
and absorbed in certain materials such as oil. The ﬂuid will 
subsequently migrate to the atmosphere when hoses are 
disconnected or systems are opened following recovery. Such 
releases occur throughout the life of the ﬂuid regardless of the 
application, but a lack of training and insufﬁcient awareness 
of the environmental impact of ﬂuids means that personnel are 
less likely to mitigate emissions when handling them.
Intentional/Functional
Intentional releases are determined by human activity and 
may be unnecessary or required because of the function of 
the application (e.g. aerosols, ﬁre protection). Unnecessary 
intentional releases occur where the operator chooses to directly 
release the ﬂuid to the atmosphere. Examples include venting 
where the ﬂuid is not recovered following removal from an 
application, the ﬂuid being released directly through opening 
valves or cutting into pipe work, or the operator employing the 
ﬂuid for ulterior uses such as blowing dust from pipes, and so 
forth.
  
Functional emissions occur speciﬁcally with ﬁre protection, 
aerosols and some solvent uses. In situations where the ﬂuid 
is within storage facilities, or within pressure systems during 
the in-use stage, intentional releases can occur in response to 
uncontrolled circumstances, for example, when pressure relief 
devices vent in the event of ﬁre. Similarly, ﬁre protection sys-
tems may release ﬂuid in response to false signals from heat, 
smoke or light detectors, thus discharging the whole system. 
 
3.2.1.3  Measurement and estimation of emissions
Quantifying emissions from a speciﬁc application is useful for 
several purposes, including the retrospective environmental 
impact assessment or the evaluation of operating costs. 
Unfortunately for most applications it is difﬁcult to measure the 
ﬁeld leakage and even where this is possible, the measurement 
is imprecise. Laboratory studies are largely impractical for 
most applications, for example large supermarket refrigeration 
systems that are built and maintained by a number of different 
companies. However, emissions from foams are usually less 
sensitive to external conditions and so laboratory measurements 
are normally highly appropriate. Releases during ﬂuid 
manufacture, ﬂuid distribution and the manufacture/distribution 
of equipment would normally be measured by monitoring the 
mass ﬂow of material into and out of facilities. The same applies 
at end-of-life, when recovered ﬂuid is returned to suppliers and 
delivered to recycling or incineration facilities.
 
Since releases at the in-use stage tend to predominate, these 
are more frequently monitored. The problem with existing 
methods such as gas detection is that they do not measure the 
mass of ﬂuid released; concentrations of leaked gas detected 
indicate the presence of a leak, but do not permit this to be 
quantiﬁed (Van Gerwen and Van der Wekken, 1995). Recent 
developments in leak detection for refrigerating systems include 
intrinsic detectors, where a reduction in refrigerant inventory 
is measured within the system (as opposed to measuring the 
presence of refrigerant outside it) (Peall, 2003, www.nesta.org.
uk/ourawaardees/proﬁles/3763/index.html). Such an approach is 
particularly useful for accurately measuring the loss of charge but 
does not provide information on losses from handling activities. 
The most accurate method is to record the mass usage of the 
substance. For refrigerating equipment, ﬁre protection systems 
and solvent use, this involves tracking the quantities of chemi-
cals that are acquired, distributed and used to ﬁll a net increase 
in the total mass (charge) of the equipment. Quantities not ac-
counted for are assumed to have been emitted. Entities that con-
tract equipment maintenance to service companies can estimate 
their emissions by requesting the service company to track the 
quantities of refrigerant recovered from and added to systems. 
 
Different approaches can be used to prediction emissions 
associated with particular equipment or systems. The least 
accurate but most simplistic approach is to apply annual leak 
rates (% yr-1) for the appropriate sector or equipment types to the 
mass of ﬂuid used. However, these are generally approximated 
using bottom-up methods, combined with limited measured 
data and industry interviews (e.g. March, 1996). At best, leak 
rates may be found for equipment manufacture, aggregate in-
use stage and end-of-life recovery. More detailed analyses 
may be conducted by calculating releases from each element 
throughout the equipment life. This also depends on good 
information about the ﬂow of material throughout its life, data 
on component dimensions and knowledge about the behaviour 
of technician handling (US EPA, 1995). For example, Colbourne 
and Suen (1999) provide empirically-derived emission indexes 
for the leakage of different components and different servicing 
frequencies in order to estimate leakage for a whole system. 
With this more detailed approach, the actual design of systems 
and equipment can be more accurately assessed and ‘emission 
optimization’ can be applied to the design and operation.

191
Nevertheless, it is known that leakage rates are highly erratic 
and for two similar systems these may vary from 0% to over 
100% yr-1.
 
The emission of foam-blowing agents through diffusion 
can be derived from model calculations (Vo and Paquet, 2004; 
Albouy et al., 1998). Alternatively, the residual quantity of 
blowing agents can be determined analytically, although caution 
must be exercised when using these measurements to estimate 
in-use emissions. Although the emission of the blowing agent 
out of a well-deﬁned foam system (e.g., a refrigerator or a piece 
of rigid foam) can be estimated, obtaining accurate emissions 
from the foam sector remains difﬁcult due to the variety of 
foams, blowing-agent initial concentrations, diffusion rates of 
speciﬁc blowing agents, product thicknesses, densities, usage 
conditions and cell structures. 
 
Direct measurement of greenhouse gas and other ﬂuid emis-
sions is only possible in a few cases and so the values described 
as ‘real’ data have to be calculated from secondary data. These 
calculations should conform to the standard methodologies 
already developed for emissions trading, which cover refrig-
eration and air-conditioning systems and chemical processes 
(DEFRA, 2003), and the standards and guidance for green-
house-gas emissions inventories (IPCC, 1997; IPCC, 2000a).
 
The IPCC Good Practice Guidance on National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories published in 2000 (IPCC, 2000a) includes 
three methods for estimating emissions of ODS substitutes. The 
tier 1 method that equates emissions to consumption (potential 
emissions), the tier 2a bottom-up method that applies country-
speciﬁc emission factors to estimates of equipment stock at dif-
ferent life-cycle stages, and the tier 2b top-down method that 
uses a country-level, mass-balance approach. For sectors where 
the chemical is banked into equipment, the tier 1 method is sig-
niﬁcantly less accurate than the other two approaches. This is 
particularly the case where the equipment bank is being built 
up and this is precisely the current situation for air conditioning 
and refrigeration equipment during the transition from CFCs 
and HCFCs to HFCs. In this situation, most of the chemical 
consumed is used to ﬁll new equipment volume (charge) rath-
er than to replace emitted gas, and therefore the tier 1 method 
greatly overestimates emissions. To a lesser extent, the tier 2b 
country-level, mass-balance approach is also inaccurate dur-
ing the period of bank building, but in this case, the error is 
an underestimate (see the discussion in Section 3.2.1.3 for an 
explanation of this underestimate). That is why the IPCC rec-
ommends supplementing the tier 2b approach with the tier 2a 
emission-factor based approach. The disadvantage of the tier 
2a approach is that for the ﬁrst few years of equipment life, the 
emission factors will necessarily be based on engineering esti-
mates rather than empirical experience. However, when the ﬁrst 
cohort of equipment is serviced, the emission factors can be 
corrected as necessary. Ultimately, when the HFC-using equip-
ment starts to be retired, the tier 2b method can be used on its 
own with a high level of accuracy.
 
More detailed requirements for calculations are stated in 
IPCC (1997). IPCC (2000a) should be consulted for additional 
guidelines on emission estimation methods, particularly for the 
different sectors. 
3.2.2 
Indirect emission 
This section examines aspects related to emissions arising from 
the energy consumption associated with the manufacturing of 
products and their components, the use of these products during 
their useful life and their disposal. The use phase is outlined for 
cooling applications, heat pumps and foams, as this phase usu-
ally dominates the energy consumption of these systems. More 
application-speciﬁc energy aspects are covered in the speciﬁc 
sections of Chapters 4 to 10 of this report. 
3.2.2.1 
Use phase 
ODS substitutes are typically used in cooling applications and 
thermal insulation foams. For aerosols, solvents and ﬁre protec-
tion, the energy consumption during the use phase is not rel-
evant.
Cooling applications and heat pumps 
The refrigeration, heat pump and air-conditioning sectors use 
different approaches to establish and compare energy efﬁcien-
cies for various technologies:
• Modelled efﬁciencies based on modelled coefﬁcients of 
performance (COP);
• Measured efﬁciencies of products in the research and 
development phase (established under standard test 
conditions)2;
• Measured efﬁciencies of products in mass productions 
(established under standard test conditions);
• Measured 
consumption 
under 
representative 
real 
conditions.
The coefﬁcient of performance (COP3) of a refrigerating plant, 
product or system is a key parameter for characterizing the en-
ergy efﬁciency of a process. It is the ratio of refrigerating ca-
pacity to the input power required to operate the compressor, 
pumps, fans and other ancillary components.
 
COP = Q0 / P  
 
 
 
(3.1)
Where:
Q0  is the refrigerating capacity (cooling mode) or heating 
capacity (heating mode) including an allowance for losses 
in any secondary circuit (kW), and
2 It is important that the standard conditions represent the situation in which the 
equipment will be used; for example it would not be appropriate to use standard 
test results gained at an ambient temperature of 15oC when the real ambient 
temperature of operation of the equipment is 35oC.
3 In European standards and some ISO standards the term EER (Energy 
Efﬁciency Ratio) is used for the cooling mode of the cycle and COP (Coefﬁcient 
Of Performance) is used for the heating mode. For the purpose of this report 
only one term is used, COP. Where this term is used, it should be speciﬁed 
whether it relates to cooling or heating.

P  is the total power consumption (kW) of the compressors, 
controls, fans and pumps required to deliver that capacity to 
the place where it is used.
The COP primarily depends on the working cycle and the tem-
perature levels (evaporating/condensing temperature) but is 
also affected by the properties of the refrigerant and the de-
sign of the system. Energy consumption estimated from known 
models does not usually take into account the effects due to 
different ‘real-world’ handling practices, imperfect design, as-
sembly, capacity control and maintenance. Small ﬂuid leakage, 
for example, not only impacts direct emission but also indirect 
emission due to a decrease in the COP of equipment. Figure 3.3 
gives an example of the real world spread of measured energy 
consumptions for a large group of homogenous refrigeration 
systems. Another typical example is the use of capacity control 
technologies to optimize the energy consumption. Good capac-
ity control results in smaller pressure differences (evaporating/
condensing temperature) leading to improvements of the over-
all energy efﬁciency of the system.
Insulation foams
There are two fundamental approaches to assess the effects on 
energy consumption of using insulation materials with differ-
ing insulation properties as a result of a changed blowing agent 
(Table 3.3). 
 
Further the speciﬁc usage pattern of the system should be 
noted and addressed if it is material to the calculation. One ex-
ample might be the effect of day to night temperature changes 
on a cold store that has trafﬁc through it 24 hours per day as 
opposed to one that is shut up all night. Both approaches need to 
be documented with references to standard calculation methods 
and sources of information.
 
Approach B in Table 3.3 depends on more assumptions than 
approach A and is conceptually more challenging. However 
circumstances can arise in which thickness compensation is 
technically not possible due to space constraints and then ap-
proach B is the only feasible method. Even if partial thickness 
compensation is possible, the calculation of energy impacts will 
still require approach B. 
 
In general these comparisons are limited to identical sys-
tems where only one element has been changed. Comparisons 
between completely different systems are much more difﬁcult

Table 3.3. Comparison of two approaches for comparing the impact of blowing agent choice on energy consumption.
  Approach A)   Thickness compensation:
The thickness is increased for any loss of insulation value so that unchanged energy consumption is assumed to be achieved by a material 
penalty. This may have an environmental impact due to increased direct emissions and the energy used for production. However, for the 
energy consumption during the usage phase, the key requirements are relatively simple and involve characterization of:
• 
The functional unit and its desired service (e.g. required common additional heat resistance R value m-2 of application and time);
• 
The insulant types and their reference and replacement thicknesses, and the extent to which additional foam thickness is possible, (e.g. 
respective thickness and density or mass);
• 
The insulation properties of the foam(s) using a test appropriate to the duty (e.g. respective thermal conductivity values).
  Approach B)   Comparative energy modelling:
Where it is not possible to com  pensate for a change in insulation value, the energy consumption of the system in which the foam is used 
is calculated for both the reference case and alternative case. This is a more complex process and, in addition to the parameters outlined 
above, it will require deﬁnition of:
• 
The type and efﬁciency of the process supplying heat or cold (to accommodate change in efﬁciency with temperature);
• 
The appropriate ambient conditions and the internal temperature proﬁle require or alternatively a description of an appropriate proxy 
(for example heating or cooling degree days);
• 
Internal sources of heat or cold and how the demand will change with temperature.

to interpret. Examples of comparisons of different foam types, 
where the model assumptions are clear and do not compromise 
the results, are given in Caleb (1998, 1999), Enviros March 
(1999), ADL (1999), Krähling and Krömer (2000), Harnisch 
and Hendriks (2000) and Harnisch et al. (2003).
3.2.2.2 
Production energy of ﬂuids and fugitive emissions
Table 3.4 details the small number of estimates of production 
energy (also known as embodied energy) and fugitive emissions 
associated with the production of the materials used in systems 
covered by this report. These estimates are also summarized 
and applied in Frischknecht (1999a and 1999b) and Harnisch 
et al. (2003). It is worth noting that the newer study shows 
lower values for HFC-134a due to more widespread applica-
tion of vent gas treatment to destroy ‘fugitive’ HFC streams 
(in previous studies these were emitted into the atmosphere). 
In-use emissions usually dominate environmental impact and 
production energy, whereas fugitive emissions only make small 
contributions.
3.2.2.3 
Indirect emissions from energy use 
Indirect emissions (of carbon dioxide) from the energy used to 
operate a system comprise those arising from the generation 
of the electricity consumed (for example by the compressor, 
controls, pumps and fans of a building air-conditioning sys-
tem) and any fuel used directly by the system (e.g. gas used for 
gas-driven compressors, fuel used by absorption systems or the 
additional gasoline usage associated with automobile air condi-
tioning). The total lifetime emission of carbon dioxide from the 
energy used to operate the system (EI) is:
 
EI = QE x IE + ∑(QFi x IFi) 
 
 
(3.2)
Where:
QE is the total lifetime use of electricity;
IE is the carbon dioxide intensity of electricity production (from 
Table 3.5);
QFi is the total lifetime use of fuel i, and
IFi is the carbon dioxide intensity of that fuel (from Table 3.5)
Carbon dioxide emissions associated with the generation of elec-
tricity vary greatly between countries depending on the speciﬁc 
mix of generation technologies and fuels (e.g. coal, natural gas, 
combined cycle systems, hydroelectricity, etc.) used. Increasingly 
complex calculations could be performed to deﬁne the minute 
details of energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases. However for the generic approach described 
here, it is assumed that the most important emission is carbon 
dioxide and that the methods employed by the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) will give internationally consistent esti-
mates. Accordingly, national and regional carbon dioxide inten-
sities of electricity are shown in Table 3.5. These intensities are 
calculated as the ratio of national carbon dioxide emission from 
electricity generation, taken from IEA (2002b), to the quantity 
of electricity used nationally, obtained from IEA (2002a) or IEA 
(2003). The IEA statistics take into account electricity trading 
between countries, in the form of an annual average.
 
For those countries or regions not shown in Table 3.5, the 
national carbon dioxide intensity of their electrical power (IE ) 
may be calculated as the sum of the total of each fuel used in 
electricity generation, multiplied by its carbon dioxide intensity 
(also quoted in Table 3.5), divided by the total national quantity 
of electricity delivered to customers.
 
IE = ∑ (QFi x IFi) / DE   
 
 
(3.3)
Where:
QFi  is the total annual quantity of fuel i used in electricity  
 
 
 generation and IFi is the carbon dioxide intensity of that   
 
 fuel (from Table 3.5), and

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
to technologies and production processes using ﬂuorinated 
gases. The use of consistent and well-deﬁned cost concepts is 
recommended for the assessment of the various technologies 
and options described in detail in various parts of this Special 
Report, and for reporting the assumptions and concepts applied 
in mitigation studies in a thorough and transparent manner.
 
3.2.1 
Introduction
Actions to abate emissions of ﬂuorinated gases generally divert 
resources from other alternative uses, and the aim of a cost as-
sessment is to measure the total value that society places on the 
goods and services foregone due to resources being diverted to 
climate protection. Where possible the assessment should in-
clude all resource components and implementation costs and 
should therefore take into account both the costs and beneﬁts of 
mitigation measures.
 
A key question in cost analysis is whether all relevant di-
mensions (e.g. technical, environmental, social) can be mea-
sured in the same units as the costs (i.e. monetary). It is gen-
erally accepted that some impacts, such as avoided climate 
change, cannot be fully represented by monetary estimates and 
it is imperative that the cost methodology is supplemented by a 
broader assessment of impacts measured in quantitative and if 
needs be qualitative terms. 
 
In any economic analysis of climate change mitigation, 
the cost of mitigation is calculated as a difference in costs and 
beneﬁts between a baseline case and a policy case that implies 
lower emissions. Where possible, the deﬁnitions of the base-
line and policy cases should include all major social, economic 
and environmental impacts (at minimum from GHG emissions 
and ODP emissions). In other words, the system boundary of 
the cost analysis should facilitate the inclusion of all major im-
pacts. The system boundary can be a speciﬁc project, one or 
more sectors, or the entire economy.
The project, sector and macroeconomic levels can be deﬁned 
as follows:
1. Project. A project level analysis considers a ‘stand-alone’ 
investment that is assumed not to have signiﬁcant impacts 
on markets beyond the activity itself. The activity can be the 
implementation of speciﬁc technical facilities, demand-side 
regulations, technical standards, information efforts, and so 
forth. Methodological frameworks to assess the project level 
impacts include cost-beneﬁt analysis, cost-effectiveness 
analysis and Life Cycle Assessment.
2. Sector. Sector level analysis considers sectoral policies in a 
‘partial equilibrium’ context, for which all other sectors and 
the macroeconomic variables are assumed to be as given.
3. Macroeconomic. A macroeconomic analysis considers the 
impacts of policies across all sectors and markets. 
Costs and beneﬁts can be reported in present values or as level-
ized values (alternative ways to generate time-consistent values 
for ﬂows of costs and beneﬁts that occur at different points in 
time). Further details about these approaches can be found in 
Box 3.1. 
 
This report focuses on project level cost analysis in particu-
lar because a); the scale of the mitigation policies analyzed can 
be considered small enough to exclude signiﬁcant sectoral and 
economy-wide impacts; b) the basis for conducting a sectoral 
level cost analysis is weak since the literature does not include 
sectoral modelling studies for activities which involve the pro-
duction and use of ODSs and their substitutes; c) and ﬁnally 
the current section is a ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne consistent cost 
concepts applied to the assessment of climate change and ODS 
mitigation policies.
3.3.2 
Direct engineering and ﬁnancial cost approach
At the project level, the simplest cost assessment considers the 
ﬁnancial costs of introducing a new technology or a produc-
tion process that has lower emissions than the baseline case. 
Such practices can imply capital costs of new investments and 
changed operation and maintenance costs. When the system 
boundary is deﬁned to include only the ﬁnancial costs associ-
ated with the project implementation, some studies been termed 
this the direct engineering or ﬁnancial cost approach.
 
Policy implementation can require upfront capital costs and 
changes (decreases or increases) in operation and maintenance 
costs compared with the baseline case over the lifetime of the 
project. Major categories of costs accounted in a ﬁnancial cost 
assessment are capital, labour, land, materials, maintenance 
and administrative costs. The various costing elements need to 
be transformed into values that are comparable over the time 
frame and as such the cost assessment depends on assumptions 
about discount rates. The time dimension of costs can be dealt 
with using various policy evaluation approaches and an over-
view of some of those applied to the cost-effectiveness analysis 
of projects is given in Box 3.1. 
3.3.2.1 
Discounting
There are two approaches to discounting (IPCC, 1996b). One 
approach (known as ethical) gives special attention to the wealth 
of future generations and uses a social discounting rate. Another 
approach (known as descriptive) is based on the discount rates 
savers and investors actually apply on their day-to-day deci-
sions and uses a higher, private cost discount rate. The former 
leads to relatively low rates of discount (around 2−3% in real 
terms) and the latter to relatively higher rates (at least 6% and in 
some case very much higher rates) (IPCC, 2001b, pp. 466).
 
For climate change, a distinction needs to be drawn between 
the assessment of mitigation programmes and the analysis of 
impacts caused by climate change. The discount rate applied in 
cost assessment depends on whether the social or private per-
spective is taken. The issues involved in applying discount rates 
in this context are addressed below. For mitigation effects, the

country must base its decisions, at least in part, on discount 
rates that reﬂect the opportunity cost of capital. In developed 
countries, rates of around 4%–6% are probably justiﬁed (Watts, 
1999). In developing countries the rate could be as high as 10–
12%. These rates do not reﬂect private rates of return, which 
typically need to be considerably higher to justify the project, 
potentially between 10% and 25%. 
For climate change impacts, the long-term nature of the prob-
lem is the key issue. The speciﬁc beneﬁts of a GHG emission 
reduction depend on several factors such as the timing of the 
reduction, the atmospheric GHG concentration at the time of re-
duction and afterwards.. These are difﬁcult to estimate. Any ‘re-
alistic’ discount rate used to discount the impacts of increased 
climate change impacts would render the damages, which occur 
over long periods of time, very small. 
3.3.3 
Investment cycle and sector inertia
In the area of technologies associated with the manufacture and 
use of ﬂuorinated gases, observations about replacement rates 
of old products have shown that it has been possible to under-
take investments with a payback period as low as 1 to 5 years. 
This evidence suggests that from an economic and technical 
point of view4, it is possible to rely on mitigation policies that 
are fully implemented over less than a decade. However, social 
structures and personal values also interact with society’s phys-
BOX 3.1 – The NPV and Levelized Cost Concepts
Guidelines for project assessment use a number of different concepts to compare the cost-effectiveness of projects. The most 
frequently used concepts are net present value (NPV) and levelized cost. These concepts basically provide similar project 
ranking.
The NPV concept
The NPV concept can be used to determine the present value of net costs, NPVC, incurred in a time period T, by discounting 
the stream of costs (Ct) back to the beginning of the base year (t = 0) at a discount rate I:
The levelized cost concept
The levelized cost represent a transformation of the NPCV into constant annual cost values, C0, over the lifetime of the pro-
ject. The levelized costs are calculated as a transformation of the NPVC using the formula:
�� � ���� � � ����� �����
� �
�
where n is the time horizon over which the investment is evaluated.
The levelized costs can directly be compared with annual emission reductions if these are constant over the project lifetime.
The use of NPV and levelized costs as project ranking criteria is valid, given a number of assumptions:
NPV
An investment I1 is more favourable than another investment I2 if NPVC1/GHG reduction < NPVC2/GHG reduction. It should 
here be noticed that the use of NPVCs to compare the cost-efﬁciency of projects requires that some discounting criteria be ap-
plied to the annual greenhouse-gas emission reductions. The NPVC/GHG ratio can be used to rank investments with different 
time horizons.
Levelized cost
An investment I1 is more favourable than another investment I2 if the levelized cost of I1 per unit of annual emission reduction 
is less than the levelized cost of I2 per unit of annual emission reduction. The levelized costs should be calculated for similar 
investment lifetimes. The lifetimes of the investments if necessary can be made uniform by adding terminal values to invest-
ments with relatively long life time, or by replicating investments that have a relatively short lifetime.

transitions for future technical evolution in these sectors. Transition from CFCs

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
ical infrastructure, technology applications and institutions, and 
these combined systems have in many cases evolved relatively 
slowly. An example of such system inertia is seen in relation to 
the energy consumption for heating, cooling and transport, and 
the impacts of urban design and infrastructure. Markets some-
times tend to ‘lock in’ to speciﬁc technologies and practices 
that are economically and environmentally suboptimal, because 
the existing infrastructure makes it difﬁcult to introduce alter-
natives. Similarly the diffusion of many innovations can be in 
conﬂict with people’s traditional preferences and other social 
and cultural values (IPCC, 2001a, pp. 92-93). 
 
At the same time, it should also be recognized that social 
and economic time scales are not ﬁxed. They are sensitive to so-
cial and economic forces, and are inﬂuenced by policies as well 
as the choices made by individuals and institutions. In some 
cases behavioural and technological changes have occurred 
rapidly under severe economic conditions, for example during 
the oil crises of the 1970s (IPCC, 2001a, pp. 93). Apparently, 
the converse can also be true: In situations where the pressure 
to change is small, inertia is large.
 
Both of these issues should be considered when building 
scenarios about future GHG emissions from a sector. These les-
sons suggest that new policy approaches are needed. Instead of 
looking solely for least-cost policies given current preferences 
and social norms, policies could also aim at reshaping human 
behaviour and norms. This could support fast technology pen-
etration and from a longer time perspective in particular, could 
imply cost reductions through learning and market develop-
ment.
3.3.4 
Wider costing methodologies − concepts
Up until now we have only considered the direct engineering 
and ﬁnancial costs of speciﬁc technical measures. However, the 
implementation of policy options that mitigate climate change 
and ODSs will often imply a wider range of social and environ-
mental impacts that need to be considered in a cost analysis. 
3.3.4.1 
Social and ﬁnancial costs
In all work on costs, a basic distinction can be drawn between 
the social cost of any activity and the ﬁnancial cost. Social cost 
is the full value of the scarce resources used in the activity mea-
sured from the point of view of society. Financial cost measures 
the costs from the perspective of a private company or an indi-
vidual and bases its values on the costs that actually face these 
agents. A difference between social and ﬁnancial costs arises 
when private agents do not take full account of the costs that 
they impose on other agents through their activities − such a 
cost is termed an external cost. Positive impacts which are not 
accounted for in the actions of the agent responsible, are re-
ferred to as external beneﬁts.
 
External costs and beneﬁts are distinct from the costs and 
beneﬁts that companies or other private agents take into ac-
count when determining their outputs such as the prices of fuel, 
labour, transportation and energy, known as conventional com-
pany costs, and also from environmental costs usually account-
ed in more complete evaluations of company costs (see Table 
3.7). Categories of costs that inﬂuence an individual’s decision-
making are referred to as private costs. The total cost to society 
is the sum of the external and private costs, which together are 
deﬁned as social cost:
 
Social Cost = External Cost + Private Cost 
(3.4)
The scope of the social and private costs is illustrated in Figure 
3.4.
 
External costs typically arise when markets fail to provide a 
link between the person who creates the ‘externality’ and the per-
son who is affected by it, or more generally when property rights 
for the relevant resources are not well deﬁned. Externalities do 
not necessarily arise when there are effects on third parties. In 
some cases, these effects may already be recognized, or ‘inter-
nalized’ and included in the price of goods and services. Figure 
3.4 illustrates different subcategories of environmental costs, 
including external costs and private costs as faced by a private 
company. The centre box represents company costs that are 
typically considered in conventional decision-making. The next 
box (private costs) includes the typical costs plus other internal 
environmental costs that are potentially overlooked in decision-
making, including regulatory, voluntary, up-front, operational, 
back-end, overhead, future, contingent and image/relationship 
costs. These ‘private costs’ include internal intangible costs 
(e.g., costs that could be experienced by a company related 
to delays in permitting, and so forth, and due to disputation 
with regulators and others). The box labelled societal includes 
environmental costs that are external to a company. These are 
costs incurred as a result of a company affecting the environment 
or human health, but for which the company is not currently 
held legally or ﬁscally responsible. These ‘externalities’ include 
environmental degradation and adverse effects on humans,

property and welfare associated with emissions/activities that 
are performed in compliance with regulatory requirements. 
The ﬁgure does not directly portray the beneﬁts that may be 
associated with alternative decisions.
3.3.4.2 
Welfare basis of costs
The external effects described above cannot be valued directly 
from market data, because there are no ‘prices’ for the resources 
associated with the external effects (such as clean air or clean 
water). Indirect methods must therefore be used. Values have to 
be inferred from decisions of individuals in related markets, or 
by using questionnaires to directly determine the individuals’ 
willingness to pay (WTP) to receive the resource or their will-
ingness to accept payment (WTA) for the environmental good. 
3.3.4.3 
Ancillary costs and beneﬁts
Projects or policies designed for GHG and ODS mitigation fre-
quently have signiﬁcant impacts on resource use efﬁciency, re-
ductions in local and regional air pollution, and on other issues 
such as employment (IPCC, 2001b, pp. 462). When estimating 
the social costs of using technologies that impact climate change 
and/or ODS, all changes in cost arising from this activity have 
to be taken into account. If some of them imply a reduction 
(increase) in external costs, they are sometimes referred to as 
secondary, indirect beneﬁts (costs) or ancillary beneﬁts (costs).

3.3.5 
Wider costing methodologies – cost categories
3.3.5.1 
Project Costs
This item has already been discussed in the introduction of 
Section 3.3.2. However, the cost categories listed there may 
need to be adjusted when carrying out the wider cost methodol-
ogy. Adjustments in land costs, labour, investments, materials, 
energy costs, environmental services and foreign exchange may 
be needed for private costs and external costs, and a detailed list 
is provided by Markandya and K. Halsnæs (2000).
3.3.5.2 
Implementation cost
In addition to the above, the costs of implementation deserve 
special attention. Many aspects of implementation are not fully 
covered in conventional cost analyses (see Table 3.7). A lot of 
work needs to be done to quantify the institutional and other 
costs of programmes, so that the reported cost ﬁgures repre-
sent the full costs of policy implementation. As shown in Table 
3.7, implementation costs depend on institutional and human 
capacities, information requirements, market size and the learn-
ing potential, as well as on market prices and regulations in the 
form of taxes and subsidies. 
3.3.6 
Key economic drivers and uncertainty
For various reasons cost estimates are shrouded by uncertain-
ty and therefore any presentation of cost estimates should in-
clude transparent information about various keys to uncertainty 
that relate to both the baseline case and the new project case. 
Uncertainty in baseline cases is best dealt with by reporting cost 
estimates for multiple as opposed to single baselines. With this 
costs will not be given as single values, but as ranges based 
on the full set of plausible baselines (see for example IPCC, 
2001b, pp. 30-37).
 
Uncertainties in cost estimates are related to both private 
and external cost components. Private cost ﬁgures tend to be 
less uncertain than external cost components, since the private 
costs primarily relate to market-based economic transactions. 
However, there is a particular uncertainty related to projections 
of future efﬁciency, and the costs and penetration rates of new 
technologies. One way to handle this uncertainty is to under-
take a sensitivity analysis based on scenarios for high, low and 
medium case values (Markandya and Halsnæs, 2000). Another 
way of accounting is to consider some kind of ‘learning curve’, 
that is an expected cost reduction as a function of the increasing 
amount of products using the technology. 
3.3.7 
Other issues
3.3.7.1 
Baseline Scenarios
Quite often the costs of a programme are evaluated against a sit-
uation where the programme is not implemented. This situation 
is deﬁned by a baseline scenario, which tries to infer future con-
ditions without the implementation of the programme. There 
are assumptions embedded in the baseline to forecast the future, 
for example, inefﬁcient baseline, or ‘business-as-usual’ base-
line. It is important to note that a programme’s cost and beneﬁt 
will vary according to this baseline scenario deﬁnition. For a 
mitigation programme, the cost will be larger if an economi-
cally efﬁcient baseline is set rather than an inefﬁcient one.
3.3.7.2 
Macroeconomic costs
The cost of a programme can be measured using a macroeco-
nomic analysis based on dynamic models of the economy. 
These models examine the impacts of a programme at an inte-
grated level and allow for intersectoral effects. This means that 
they are more suitable for programmes large enough to produce 
impacts on other sectors of the economy.
 
On the other hand macroeconomic cost estimates generally 
provide less detail about technological options and externalities 
than project or sectoral cost estimates.
3.3.7.3 
The equity issue
Equity considerations are concerned with the issues of how the 
costs and beneﬁts of a programme are distributed and the cli-
mate change impacts avoided, as input to a more general dis-
cussion about the fairness of climate change policies. Equity 
concerns can be integrated in cost analysis by reporting the dis-
tribution of costs and beneﬁts to individuals and society as a 
supplement to total cost estimates. Some authors also suggest 
applying income distribution weightings to the costs and ben-
eﬁts to reﬂect the prosperity of beneﬁciaries and losers (Ray, 
1984; Banuri et al., 1996).
3.3.8 
Conclusions
For most of the mitigation measures discussed in this Special 
Report, the speciﬁc measures (e.g. technical facilities, infra-
structure, demand-side regulation, supply-side regulation, in-
formation efforts, technical standards) can be considered to 
have relatively small economic impacts outside of a narrow 
project border and can therefore be regarded as ‘stand-alone’ 
investments that are assessed using a project assessment ap-
proach. However, this does not imply that the cost assessment 
should solely limit itself to a consideration of the ﬁnancial cost 
elements. A project system boundary allows a fairly detailed 
assessment of GHG emissions and the economic and social 
impacts generated by a speciﬁc project or policy. Accordingly 
various direct and indirect social costs and beneﬁts of the GHG 
reduction policies under consideration should be included in the 
analysis.
 
Furthermore, it should be realized that as industrial com-
petition increases, an increasing number of companies might 
become interested in using the most advanced production para-
digms. For example, this was the case for lean production, an 
approach which evolved in Japan during the post-war period 
and implied greater ﬂexibility in production and working part-
ners. Many typical company features have included environ-
mental concerns as well as broader issues of sustainable devel-
opment as an evolving feature of the lean production paradigm.

Chapter 3: Methodologies

In other words the companies have expanded the view about the 
boundaries of their own production.
 
Companies set boundaries around the activities they man-
age directly as well as those they do not control or manage. A 
distinctive feature of the lean production system has been an 
increasing transparency across ﬁrms that are dealing with dif-
ferent elements of the production chain. There has also been a 
tendency towards integrating management functions along the 
supply chain in order to examine the entire production chain for 
added value sources, irrespective of the current legal company 
boundaries along the chain. The application of information 
technology to business processes has facilitated the introduc-
tion of these new management systems. Without this the appli-
cation of quantitative methods would have proved too complex 
(Wallace, 1996).
 
This new integrated management approach is illustrated in 
Figure 3.5. The ﬁgure shows a typical production chain, where 
the dotted line represents the boundary within the production 
process. Within that boundary, the management of the process 
may be integrated, irrespective of the number of companies in-
volved or their exact legal relationship. This boundary might 
also include the extraction of raw materials, various product 
end-uses and even the disposal of the materials after use.
 
Every stage of production and consumption implies im-
portant environmental impacts. Companies are increasingly 
being required to explicitly manage these environmental im-
pacts in response to formal regulations and pollution charges. 
Alternatively they might voluntarily adopt cleaner production 
technologies and tools, such as eco-auditing, in response to in-
creasing expectations from society. Another driving force can 
be the increasing legislative liabilities of companies with re-
spect to pollution. It is therefore useful for analysts to consider 
a system-wide company boundary that includes all stages of 
production in life cycle assessment, as shown in Figure 3.5.
3.4 
Consideration of health and safety issues
Health and safety issues are an integral aspect of deciding the 
choice of ﬂuids when alternatives are available, and the deci-
sions can have far-reaching consequences for the workforce, 
domestic consumers, industry, the environment and the econ-
omy. Assessment methods for health and safety should ﬁrst of 
all focus on minimizing negative health and safety impacts, and 
then consider risk management, policy and regulatory controls. 
This approach should be used for each step of the life cycle 
of the product including production, distribution, use, main-
tenance, repair and the end-of-life treatment such as destruc-
tion, re-use or recycling. Sometimes it can be wise to accept 
an increase in one life-cycle stage so as to arrive at an overall 
improvement in the impact accumulated over the life cycle. 
During the switch from ozone-depleting substances (CFCs and 
HCFCs) to HFCs, the health and safety risks of both groups 
of chemicals were similar. Here the main concern was energy 
efﬁciency and reliability. During the switch from higher GWP 
ﬂuids to lower GWP ﬂuids, health and safety often become a 
key issue. Some of the key considerations are examined in the 
following sections.
3.4.1 
Prevention of negative health and safety impacts
Chemical exposure can cause or contribute to many serious 
health effects such as heart ailments, damage to the central 
nervous system, kidney and lungs, sterility, cancer, burns and 
rashes (US DoL, 1998). The impact of these effects includes 
lower productivity, absenteeism, increased health-care costs, 
litigation, and economic downturn at both the enterprise and 
national levels. Most countries have passed occupational health 
and safety laws in response to this, but the enforcement of such 
legislation is difﬁcult, particularly in developing countries. This 
is borne out by the fact that only 5−10 % of workers in de-
veloping countries and 20–50 % of workers in industrialized 
countries (with a few exceptions) are estimated to have access 
to adequate occupational health services (Chemical Hazard 
communication: US Department of Labour (1998 revised). 
However, given the potential negative impacts in the absence

of adequate health and safety precautions, it is in the interest 
of both businesses and government to minimize these. Periods 
in which businesses are undergoing technological changes pro-
vide good opportunities to institute measures for preventing 
negative health and safety impacts on their workers and op-
erations. They also provide governments with opportunities to 
implement measures to ensure that these matters are considered 
during the period of change.
3.4.2 
Risk assessment of chemicals
Risk assessment is central to safety. It provides the scientiﬁcally 
sound basis for actions, including policy and regulatory actions 
to manage potential risks from the production, storage, trans-
portation, use and disposal of chemicals. A number of param-
eters must be considered when undertaking risk assessments, 
such as chemical composition, stability and reactivity, hazards 
identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation, transportation, storage and 
handling, ecological impacts, physical and chemical properties, 
routes of exposure, effects of exposure, exposure limits, and 
toxicological information. As well as guiding the decision on 
the choice of a chemical to be used for a particular application, 
the assessment will also inform decisions on risk management 
as well as policy and regulatory controls.
3.4.3 
Risk management of systems
Risk management is a broad term for the process that uses the 
outcomes of a scientiﬁc risk assessment to implement best prac-
tices, which are usually supported by appropriate policy and 
regulatory frameworks. A number of options are usually avail-
able for managing risk. These depend on the nature of the risk 
and the technological, economic and policy options available to 
address this. Effective risk management includes a wide range 
of measures such as information provision, training and/or re-
training, risk assessment training, redesignated work practices, 
use of personal protective equipment, evaluation and monitor-
ing of both the immediate and wider environments, redeﬁnition 
of exposure limits and standards, and medical examinations. 
3.4.4 
Policy and regulatory controls
Most countries have occupational health and safety laws that re-
quire employers (as far as it is reasonable and practicable) to pro-
vide safe working environments and to develop and implement 
policies and measures to educate and protect their employees. In 
general, laws are developed on the principles of precaution and 
reasonableness, and these need to be adjusted when new pro-
cesses, technologies or inputs are introduced into the economy 
that have health and safety implications not covered under the 
existing framework. Governments are responsible for ensuring 
that an appropriate regulatory and policy framework exists to 
protect human and ecological health and safety as well as prop-
erty, and to ensure compliance. When such a framework and the 
associated legal requirements are compiled, the health and safety 
of the user, worker and those in the locality must be the main 
priorities. Product liability laws have been established in several 
areas of the world to protect users, workers and members of the 
public with respect to health and safety or any other damage. 
The liability legislation in a country is an important factor in the 
choice of the system and ﬂuid chosen for the application, irre-
spective of what the safety standard speciﬁes. When drawing up 
regulations, the combination of several regulatory requirements, 
including product liability, needs to be taken into account. 
3.4.5 
Health and safety criteria
For the purposes of this report, health and safety issues are con-
sidered under the following criteria:
Flammability: 
Ability to support combustion; a high ca-
pacity for combustion; burning velocity 
and expansion ratio. 
Acute toxicity: 
Adverse effects are observed within a 
short time after exposure to a chemical. 
This exposure may be a single dose, a 
short period of continuous exposure, or 
multiple doses over a period of 24 hours 
or less. 
Chronic toxicity: 
Adverse effects observed following re-
peated exposure to a chemical during a 
substantial fraction of an organism’s lifes-
pan. For human chronic toxicity typically 
means exposure over several decades; for 
experimental animals it is typically more 
than 3 months.
Carcinogenicity: 
The ability of a substance or agent to pro-
duce or provoke cancer.
Acute ecotoxicity: 
Adverse effect on ecosystems and/or the 
organisms within the ecosystem within a 
short period of time after exposure to a 
chemical.
Chronic ecotoxicity: Adverse effects to an ecosystem and/or 
the organisms within the ecosystem fol-
lowing exposure to a chemical during a 
substantial fraction of the ecosystem’s or 
organism’s lifespan.
Accumulation: 
The action or process of accumulating 
within biological tissues.
Persistence: 
Continued presence of a chemical or its 
effects in the environment after source or 
cause has stopped.

The data for health and safety are extensive and this report only 
includes references to the databases. Most data can be found 
on the site of the International Programme on Chemical Safety

The International Chemical Safety Cards (ICSCs) (www.inchem.

for a very limited number of substances. They are similar to 
the Environmental Health Criteria Monographs (EHC) (www.

chemicals on human health and the environment.

ditioning” and ISO TC 21 “Equipment for ﬁre protection and

then national standards or the material safety data sheet from 
the supplier can be used as the source of information. Care is 
needed when using material safety data sheets from suppliers, as 
these data are not always peer reviewed. The most recent peer-
reviewed data agreed at an international level (IPCS, PAFT or

The information required for health and safety consider-
ations depend on the subsector and application involved. For 
example, the data required for refrigeration and air condition-
ing are different from that for ﬁre protection and medical aero-
sols. Even within a sector, regional differences exist for detailed 
data. Each sector shall use the appropriate data valid for it to 
perform the risk assessment and management with respect to 
health and safety. For refrigeration and air conditioning an ISO 
work item has been approved to unify the data and resolve the 
regional differences (ISO TC 86/SC8/WG5). For ﬁre protection 
this is handled by ISO TC 21.

Assessing climate and environmental impacts
This chapter describes approaches in which the environmental 
comparisons are made systematically using standardized proce-
dures and factors. They are most suitably used for making com-
parisons between individual installations or items of equipment 
and do not provide ‘generic’ information. There is a hierarchy 
among the system-based approaches, which depends on the 
scope of treatment, but they all seek to apply data in the same 
rigorous manner. In every case, care should be taken to examine 
and clearly deﬁne the scope of the analysis, taking into account 
the requirements of those who commissioned the study.
3.5.1 
Environmental impact categories and respective 
indicators including approaches for their ranking
A rational choice of systems, such as heating and cooling, to 
provide for societal needs should include an assessment of their 
environmental impact so that excessive demands on the envi-
ronment can be identiﬁed and avoided. Environmental impact 
depends as much on the quantity of the material emitted as it 
does on the material’s properties. Climate change and ozone 
depletion are clearly prioritized in this report. Within another 
framework, other impact categories such as energy-related 
acidiﬁcation or resource depletion could be emphasized. An ex-
haustive list of potential impact parameters or a deﬁnition of the 
process of life cycle assessment fall outside of the scope of this 
report. However, the principal environmental impacts that may 
be considered for systems using HFCs, PFCs and other replace-
ments for ozone-depleting substances are:
 
Climate Change The radiative effects of CFCs and their al-
ternatives on climate is discussed in detail in Chapter 2 and, for 
the purposes of comparisons between climate impacts, the most 
important parameter is global-warming potential. This is a con-
version factor that relates the climatic impact from an emission 
of particular greenhouse gas to that of an equivalent amount 
of emissions of carbon dioxide. It is calculated by integrating 
the radiative forcing from an emission of one kilogram of the 
greenhouse gas over a ﬁxed time period (the integration time 
horizon, ITH) and comparing it to the same integral for a kilo-
gram of carbon dioxide; units are (kg CO2 equivalent)(kg emis-
sion)-1. Commonly quoted integration time horizons are 20, 
100 and 500 years with impacts beyond each ITH being ig-
nored (see Table 2.1). The calculation has to be performed in 
this way because the reference gas, carbon dioxide, has a very 
long environmental lifetime; for example its impact up to 20 
years is only 9% of that up to 500 years (IPCC, 1996a). The 
standard values for the emissions accounting required by the 
Kyoto Protocol are those in the Second Assessment Report of 
the IPCC (IPCC, 1996a) at the 100-year time horizon. The 20-
year time scale does not meet the time criterion for judging sus-
tainability; focusing on 20 years would ignore most of the effect 
on future generations (WCED, 1987). GWPs from the Second 
Assessment Report at the 100-year time horizon represent the 
standard for judging national performance. For the purpose 
of system comparisons the most recent IPCC GWPs could be 
used, for example, as presented earlier in this report. However, 
it should be noted that GWPs are parameters constructed to en-
able the ranking of emissions of greenhouse gases and do not 
reﬂect absolute environmental impact in the same way as, for 
example, the calculated future radiative forcing described in 
Chapter 2.
 
Ozone depletion gases that contain reactive halogens (chlo-
rine, bromine and iodine) and are sufﬁciently unreactive to be 
transported to the stratosphere, can cause the halogen concen-
tration in the ozone layer to rise. They are therefore ozone-de-
pleting substances. For any given gas the efﬁciency of ozone 
depletion depends on the extent to which material released at 
ground level is transported into the stratosphere, how much 
halogen each molecule carries and the potency of that halogen 
for ozone depletion, and how the gas decomposes in the strato-
sphere and hence how much of its halogen content can affect

the ozone layer. These factors are combined in mathematical 
models of the atmosphere to give relative ozone depletion po-
tentials (ODPs) based on a scale where the ODP of CFC-11 
(CCl3F) is unity (Daniel et al., 1995; Albritton et al., 1999); val-
ues important for Life Cycle Assessments are shown in Table 
1.1. 
 
Acidiﬁcation: The two groups principally involved in acidi-
ﬁcation are sulphur and nitrogen compounds and, with the ex-
ception of ammonia, neither the ODS nor their substitutes have 
a direct effect in this category. However, energy-related emis-
sions can exhibit signiﬁcant acidiﬁcation potential, and degra-
dation products of substances such as HF or HCl could have 
considerable acidiﬁcation potential. Indicators for potential 
acid deposition onto the soil and in water have been developed 
with hydrogen ions as the reference substance. These factors 
permit computation of a single index for potential acidiﬁcation 
(in grams of hydrogen ions5 per functional unit of product), 
which represents the quantity of hydrogen ion emissions with 
the same potential acidifying effect:
 
acidiﬁcation index = ∑i mi x APi  
 
(3.5)
Where:
mi is the mass (in grams) of ﬂow i, and
APi are the millimoles of hydrogen ions with the same potential 
acidifying effect as one gram of ﬂow i, as listed in Table 3.8.
However, the acidiﬁcation index may not be representative 
of the actual environmental impact, as this will depend on the 
susceptibility of the receiving systems (soil and water, in this 
case).
  
Photo-oxidant formation: The relative potencies of com-
pounds in atmospheric oxidation reactions are characterized 
by their photochemical ozone creation potentials (POCP), on 
a scale where ethene is 100 (Derwent et al., 1998). The hydro-
carbon substitutes for ODSs have POCPs ranging from 30 to 60 
but HFCs and PFCs are not implicated in any signiﬁcant photo-
oxidant formation (Albritton et al., 1989) and are among the 
lowest priority category for volatile organic compound regula-
tion (UN-ECE, 1991).
 
Resource depletion: The production of all of the chemicals 
considered in this report will deplete resources and the extent 
of this should become apparent in a Life Cycle Assessment. For 
example, an important consideration for ﬂuorinated gases is the 
extraction of ﬂuorspar mineral, as most of this is destined for 
the manufacture of ﬂuorochemicals (Miller, 1999). 
 
Eutrophication is the addition of mineral nutrients to soil or 
water. In both media, the addition of large quantities of mineral 
nutrients (such as ammonium, nitrate and phosphate ions) re-
sults in generally undesirable shifts in the number of species in 
ecosystems and a reduction in ecological diversity. In water it 
tends to increase algal growth, which can cause a depletion in 
oxygen and therefore the death of species such as ﬁsh. 
Characterization factors for potential eutrophication have been 
developed, in a similar vein to those for the global-warming 
potential, with nitrogen as the reference substance. These fac-
tors permit the computation of separate indices for the potential 
eutrophication of soil and water (in grams of nitrogen per func-
tional unit of product), which represent the quantity of nitrogen 
with the same potential nutrifying effect:
 
eutrophication index (to water) = ∑i mi x EPi 
(3.6)
Where:
mi is the mass (in grams) of inventory ﬂow i, to water, and
EPi are the grams of nitrogen with the same potential nutrifying 
effect as one gram of inventory ﬂow i, as listed in Table 3.9.
The calculation for soil eutrophication is similar but, for both 
soil and water the actual impact will vary, dependent on the 
ability of the local environment to cope with an additional stress 
of this sort, as was the case for acidiﬁcation.
 
Ecotoxicity is the introduction of a compound that is per-
sistent, toxic and can accumulate in the biosphere (commonly 
shortened to PTB). All three attributes are required for environ-
mental releases to accumulate to the point at which there is a 
toxic response. No such compounds are known to be directly 
associated with the production and use of any of the ﬂuorocar-
bons considered in this report. An in-depth discussion of eco-
toxicity issues can be found in Hauschild and Wenzel (1998), 
Heijungs (1992) and Goedkoop (1995).

are best used for making comparisons between individual in-
stallations or items of equipment and do not provide ‘generic’ 
information. There is a hierarchy among the system-based ap-
proaches, which depends on the scope of treatment, but they all 
seek to apply data in the same rigorous manner. In every case, 
the scope of the analysis should be clearly examined and de-
ﬁned, taking into account the requirements of those who com-
missioned the study.
 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is clearly the most compre-
hensive and formal approach to assessing and comparing the 
environmental impacts of technologies. The methodology for 
LCAs has been developed and formalized in the ISO 14040 se-
ries of international standards. On the other hand, TEWI (Total 
Equivalent Warming Impact) has the most limited scope, but 
has been applied most widely for the technologies within the 
remit of this report. It addresses the climatic impact of equip-
ment operation and the disposal of operating ﬂuids at end-of-
life but, although it may be appropriate for most of the common 
systems, it does not consider the energy embodied in the ﬂuid 
or equipment. This energy may be important in some cases and 
this consideration has led to the concept of LCCP (Life Cycle 
Climate Performance). 
 
In LCCP a more complete climatic impact of the ﬂuid is 
calculated and includes the impacts from its manufacture, the 
impacts from operating and servicing the system and ﬁnally 
those associated with disposal of the ﬂuid at the system’s end 
of useful life. However, both TEWI and LCCP consider just the 
climatic impact; this is reasonable for cases where the predomi-
nant environmental impact is on climate. Life cycle assessment 
(LCA) is the broadest-based approach and this includes the en-
vironmental impacts of other inputs and outputs to the system, 
in addition to those associated with energy.
 
LCCP can be seen as a submethod of LCA and TEWI as 
a submethod of LCCP. To a large extent the approach chosen 
will depend on the context. If the information required is the 
relative climate impacts of a number of alternative approaches 
for achieving a societal good, then TEWI or LCCP are likely 
to provide adequate information. However this will ignore all 
other environmental impacts that are addressed in LCA, assum-
ing that these will be similar for the alternative technologies. 
Although the three approaches differ in their scope, all of data 
should be derived and all of the analyses performed with the 
same rigour.
3.5.2.1 
Total equivalent warming impact (TEWI)
Arguably the largest environmental impact from many refriger-
ation and air-conditioning applications arises from their energy 
consumption and emissions during their operation. Similarly, 
the energy saved by thermal insulating foam is the principal 
offset for any effect due to ﬂuid emissions. In order to help 
quantify these effects, TEWI sets out to standardize the calcula-
tion of climate-change impact in terms of emissions over the 
service life of the equipment, including emissions arising from 
the disposal of the ﬂuids it contains. The units of TEWI are 
mass of CO2 equivalent.
TEWI using generic or default data.
The analysis is performed by calculating the direct emissions 
of the ﬂuids contained in each system from leakage during op-
eration over its entire service lifetime. This includes servicing 
and the system’s eventual decommissioning and disposal. In 
this context, the system does not cover the full life cycle (ISO, 
1997) but includes the operation, decommissioning and dispos-
al of the application. 
 
The total mass emission of each greenhouse-gas component 
is converted to CO2-equivalent emissions using GWP (see dis-
cussion in Section 3.5.1) as the conversion factor (see Table 
2.1). These ﬁgures are then added to the emissions of actual car-
bon dioxide arising from the energy used during operation (see 
3.2.2.3) to give a TEWI value for the lifetime of the equipment. 
Examples of ‘equipment’ are a refrigeration or air-condition-
ing system, or a building (particularly if it is insulated). There 
is often a combination of energy-consuming and energy-con-
serving parts, and different direct releases of greenhouse gases. 
Typically:
 
TEWIS = ∑ORi x GWPi + ∑DRi x GWPi + EI 
(3.7)
Where:
TEWIS  is the total equivalent warming impact from system S 
(for example, a particular refrigeration system or build-
ing installation) the units of which are mass of CO2 
equivalent;
ORi   
is the operational release of each greenhouse gas i (the 
mass total of the releases of each gas during the sys-
tem’s operating lifetime);
GWPi 
 is the global-warming potential of greenhouse gas i 
(at the 100-year integration time horizon, as discussed 
below);

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
DRi   
is the total mass of each greenhouse gas i released 
when the system is decommissioned, and
EI    
is the indirect emission of carbon dioxide resulting 
from the energy used to operate the system (for its 
whole lifetime), already discussed in Section 3.2.1.3 
and calculated according to Equation 3.2, above.
While this is apparently an absolute value, it can carry a high 
uncertainty associated with the assumptions and factors used 
in the calculation. TEWI is most effectively used to compare 
alternative ways of performing a service, where the same as-
sumptions apply to all of the alternatives and the effect of these 
on relative ranking is minimized. A TEWI value calculated for 
one system using one methodology (i.e. set of assumptions, 
equations, procedures and source data) is not comparable with a 
TEWI value calculated for another system using another meth-
odology. Then a comparison of TEWI is meaningless.
 
Depending on the quantity of information available and the 
needs of the study, there are several levels of complexity in the 
application of TEWI. At the simplest level, a default emission 
function could be used for the ﬂuid release together with calcu-
lated energy requirements and regional carbon dioxide intensi-
ty. Default emission functions have been developed by AFEAS 
to calculate global emissions from refrigeration and closed-cell 
(insulating) foams (AFEAS, 2003). One feature of these func-
tions is that all of the substance used is eventually released (in 
some cases after many years service) and this can have a pro-
found effect on the application’s impact. 
 
In this case, the quantity released is equal to the amount 
originally charged into the system, plus any amount added dur-
ing the system’s period of service:
 
ORi + DRi = Ci + QAi  
 
 
(3.8)
Where ORi and DRi are the operational and decommissioning 
releases of substance i as described above;
Ci is the mass of i originally charged into the system, and
QAi is the mass of i added into the system during its service 
life.
For hermetic refrigeration systems (such as domestic refrig-
erators and window air conditioners), units are rarely, if ever, 
serviced and therefore QAi is set at zero because of its insigniﬁ-
cance. Yet for systems which require frequent servicing, such as 
mobile air conditioning, that default condition is not appropri-
ate and a value for QAi could be derived by analogy from the 
operation of similar systems.
 
Energy (either as power required to operate the system or 
the energy saved by thermal insulation) can be calculated us-
ing standard engineering methods. In many cases, electricity is 
used to power the equipment and this will have been produced 
by technologies that vary between countries and regions, with 
large differences in the fossil fuels used as primary sources (for 
more information see Section 3.2.1.3). Table 3.5 lists some re-
gional and national carbon dioxide intensities for electricity. 
Such a calculation is only suitable for showing major differ-
ences (say within a factor of two) due to the extensive use of de-
fault factors. Nevertheless, it is useful for identifying the more 
important areas of the calculation that would repay further re-
ﬁnement (Fischer et al., 1991 and 1992; McCulloch, 1992 and 
1994a). Uncertainties can be signiﬁcantly reduced by using ap-
propriate speciﬁc data.
GWP and integration time horizon
For the conversion of other greenhouse-gas emissions into their 
CO2 -equivalents, GWPs at the 100-year integration time hori-
zon are usually used and the source of the GWP values must 
be clearly stated. For example, TEWI analyses are now usually 
performed using the most recent GWP values published by the 
IPCC, even though this is not the normative standard. To ensure 
that the results are as portable as possible and to facilitate inter-
comparisons, the standard values from the Second Assessment 
Report of the IPCC (IPCC, 1996a) as used in the emissions 
accounting reported under the Kyoto Protocol and UNFCCC, 
have frequently been used in existing TEWI analyses.
TEWI using speciﬁc data
The next level of complexity goes beyond the use of generic 
data. It requires real emission patterns obtained from ﬁeld trials 
and operating experience and, preferably, the range of values ob-
tained from such studies should be indicated and used in a sensi-
tivity analysis (Fischer et al., 1994; ADL, 1994 and 2002; Sand 
et al., 1997; IPCC/TEAP, 1999). As the disposal of the ﬂuid can 
have a signiﬁcant impact, it is important to incorporate the real 
emissions on disposal. If the systems under consideration do not 
yet exist, the methods for calculating emissions patterns should 
have been veriﬁed against real operating systems.
 
Similarly, the actual energy consumption based on trials 
should be used in the more thorough analysis, together with the 
carbon dioxide intensity of the energy that would actually be 
used in the system. Many systems are powered electrically and 
therefore the procedures already discussed in Section 3.2.1.3 
should be applied so as to facilitate comparisons between simi-
lar systems operated in different countries. 
As in many cases electrical energy is the most important energy 
carrier, the sum of the other fuel usages and intensities can be 
neglected so that Equation 3.2 becomes:
 
EI = QE x IE   
 
 
 
(3.9)
Where 
EI is the total indirect lifetime emission of carbon dioxide from 
the energy used to operate the system;
QE is the total lifetime use of electricity, and
IE is the average carbon dioxide intensity of national electricity 
production (from Table 3.5)6.
Uncertainty
When most of the impact arises from ﬂuid emissions, the crite-

207
rion for signiﬁcance is set by the uncertainty of the GWP values 
and this is typically 35% (IPCC, 1996a). Where the impact is a 
combination of ﬂuids and CO2 from energy, the more common 
case, the total uncertainty should be assessed. A rigorous un-
certainty analysis may not be meaningful in all cases or might 
not possible due to the poorly quantiﬁed uncertainties of emis-
sion factors, emissions from the energy supply systems, speciﬁc 
energy consumption and the like. However, the sensitivity of 
uncertainty in the data is valuable because the effort required to 
gather the information needed for increasingly detailed calcula-
tions, will only be repaid if these show signiﬁcant differences. 
Uses
TEWI is particularly valuable in making choices about alterna-
tive ways of performing a function in a ‘new’ situation but it 
also can be used to minimize climate impact in existing op-
erations by providing information on the relative importance 
of sources, so that remedial actions can be prioritized. This is, 
however, methodologically restricted to those cases in which 
the original and alternative technologies remain reasonably 
similar throughout their life cycles. 
 
A standard method of calculation which includes the con-
cepts and arithmetic described here has been developed for 
refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, and the principles 
of this may be applied to other systems (BRA, 1996, consis-
tent with EN378, 2000). TEWI can also be used to optimize 
the climate performance of existing installations and methods 
of working (McCulloch, 1995a; DETR, 1999). A particularly 
valuable application is in the construction or refurbishment of 
buildings, where TEWI can be used to facilitate the choice be-
tween different forms of insulation, heating and cooling. The 
affect of the design on both the TEWI and cost can be investi-
gated, and signiﬁcant greenhouse-gas emissions abated (DETR, 
1999). The interaction between TEWI and cost is particularly 
useful when additional equipment is required to achieve an ac-
ceptable level of protection. For example, the cost of that safety 
equipment could have been invested in efﬁciency improve-
ments (ADL, 2002; Hwang et al., 2004).
 
If sufﬁcient information is available, TEWI can also be used 
to examine the climate and cost incentives of targeting opera-
tions at particular periods of the day or year when the carbon 
dioxide intensity of electrical power is lower (Beggs, 1996).
3.5.2.2 
Life cycle climate performance (LCCP)
Like TEWI, this form of analysis concentrates on the green-
house-gas emissions from direct emissions of operating ﬂuids 
together with the energy-related CO2 but, it also considers the 
fugitive emissions arising during the manufacture of the operat-
ing ﬂuids and the CO2 associated with their embodied energy. 
Like TEWI, LCCP is most effective when applied to individual 
installations, and a ‘generic’ LCCP will only be representative 
only if the data used to calculate it are representative of the 
types of installation being examined.
 
A comprehensive study has been made of representative 
LCCPs for alternative technologies in the areas of domestic re-
frigeration, automobile air conditioning, unitary air condition-
ing, large chillers, commercial refrigeration, foam building in-
sulation, solvents, aerosols (including medical aerosols) and ﬁre 
protection (ADL, 2002). The results were very similar to those 
of the TEWI analyses (see particularly Sand et al. (1997)). For 
example, the LCCP of domestic refrigerators was dominated by 
their energy use and there was no clear difference between the 
refrigerant ﬂuids or blowing agents used in insulating foams. 
However the end-of-life disposal method has a signiﬁcant im-
pact on the LCCP (Johnson, 2003). As long as the disposal of all 
of the systems was treated in the same way, automobile air con-
ditioning was most heavily inﬂuenced by the conditions under 
which it was operated (the climatic and social conditions of dif-
ferent geographical areas). Thus the highest LCCP values arose 
for vehicles in the southern USA, and this value was higher still 
if the ﬂuid chosen did not allow for efﬁcient operation (ADL, 
2002). 
 
LCCP is a useful addition to the TEWI methodology, even 
though in many cases the inﬂuence of fugitive emissions and 
embodied energy (which account for most of the difference be-
tween TEWI and LCCP results) can be small compared to the 
lifetime impact of using the system.

Where:
 LCCPS  is the system Life Cycle Climate Performance;
TEWIS  is the system TEWI, as deﬁned by Equation 3.5.1 
above;
ORi and DRi are, respectively, the quantities of ﬂuid i released 
from the system during operation and at decommis-
sioning;
EEi   
is the embodied energy of material i (the speciﬁc energy 
used during the manufacture of unit mass, expressed as 
CO2 equivalent), and
FEi   
is the sum of fugitive emissions of other greenhouse 
gases emitted during the manufacture of unit mass of i 
(expressed as their equivalent CO2 mass), so that:
 
EEi = ∑ (EEj x IFj) 
 
 
 
(3.11)
for j sources of energy used during the production of material 
i, each with a carbon dioxide intensity of IFj (see also Equation 
3.2), and:
6 The differing practice of using the carbon intensity of the most expensive fuel 
in an attempt to show the situation for an additional demand in a deregulated 
energy market, could be misleading. This carries unwarranted assumptions: the 
demand may not be additional, even if the system represents a new load. It is 
most probable that the effect of the new system on the energy balance would be, 
at least in part, to replace demand from elsewhere. And even if demand is ad-
ditional, it may not result in the most expensive energy being used. That would 
depend on the daily, weekly and seasonal demand pattern, which is beyond the 
scope of this level of TEWI analysis.

for j greenhouse gases emitted during the production of material 
i, each with a global-warming potential at 100 years of GWPj.
A comparison of Equations 3.7, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 shows that 
the difference between LCCP and TEWI is that the GWP of 
each greenhouse-gas component is augmented by the embodied 
energy and fugitive emissions of that component. However, the 
effect of these is now generally quite small as in much of the 
world the practice is to minimize or destroy process emissions 
(compare Section 3.2.1.1).
 
A relatively straightforward application for TEWI and 
LCCP analyses is the study of emissions attributable to a house-
hold refrigerator. In this case, either the refrigerant choice or the 
blowing agent choice may be studied, or both. Table 3.10 gives 
a summary of the items that would typically be considered in 
such studies.

LCA is a technique for assessing the environmental aspects 
of a means of accomplishing a function required by society (a 
‘product or service system’ in LCA terminology) and their im-
pacts. A life cycle assessment involves compiling an inventory 
of relevant inputs and outputs of the system itself and of the sys-
tems that are involved in those inputs and outputs (Life Cycle 
Inventory Analysis). The potential environmental impacts of 
these inputs and outputs are then evaluated. At each stage it is 
important to interpret the results in relation to the objectives of 
the assessment (ISO, 1997). Only an assessment which covers 
the full life cycle of the product system can be described as 
an ‘LCA’. The methodology is also applicable to other forms 
of assessment, such as TEWI described above, provided that 
the scope of the assessment and its result are clearly deﬁned. 
So whereas LCA studies describe the environmental impacts of 
product systems from raw material acquisition to ﬁnal disposal, 
studies that are conducted to the same rigorous standards for 
Table 3.10. Items considered in TEWI and LCCP studies for a refrigerator (Johnson, 2003).

subdivisions of the product chain (for example up to the sale of 
a unit to a customer) or subdivisions of the environmental im-
pact (for example LCCP and TEWI) are just as valid, and may 
better meet the requirements of those commissioning the study. 
Indeed as the use phase usually dominates the environmental 
impact of the CFC substitutes, the LCA will be application-spe-
ciﬁc. However, attempts to provide ‘generic’ LCA results can 
help to identify the most relevant life-cycle stages and impact 
categories. These attempts will also tend to be tests of the extent 
to which the assumptions made about this use phase actually 
match the real performance of the application. 
Figure 3.6 shows the steps in the general methodology. 
 
For any given analysis it is essential that the objective is 
clearly deﬁned. This should include the application, reasons for 
the study and the intended recipients of the results. To meet this 
objective, the scope of the study needs to specify the perfor-
mance characteristics of the product and to deﬁne a ‘functional 
unit’ that will be used to quantify these characteristics (ISO, 
1997 and 1998). This is a particularly important step and is best 
illustrated with examples:
 
Once a functional unit that is practical and meets the needs 
of those commissioning the assessment has been deﬁned, a 
reference ﬂow can be established from which all of the ancil-
lary inputs and outputs may be calculated. For example, in a 
cold store this could be the annual throughput of foodstuff from 
which the number of receipts and deliveries, the energy load, 
and so forth can be estimated. In any LCA it is essential that the 
system boundaries are clearly and unambiguously deﬁned. This 
includes not only the boundaries of the primary physical system 
under assessment (in this example the cold store) but also the 
extent to which inputs and outputs will be traced back to ele-
mentary ﬂows (material drawn from or placed into the environ-
ment). The documentation for the decisions on system boundar-
ies should be sufﬁcient to judge whether or not more detailed 
examination is desirable and to permit subsequent changes to 
the assessment if new information becomes available. 
 
Once the system has been deﬁned, it should then be de-
scribed in terms of its unit processes and their interrelation-
ships. Each of these unit processes has its own set of inputs and 
outputs, enabling a matrix of ﬂows, based on the reference ﬂow, 
to be constructed. This constitutes the Life Cycle Inventory. In 
the subsequent stages of LCA, the environmental impacts of the 
inputs and outputs identiﬁed in the inventory are assessed. For 
the materials addressed in this report, the most obvious impact 
categories are climate change and ozone depletion but some or 
all of the additional categories described in 3.5.1 above may 
be important (ISO, 2000a and 2000b). The end product is a de-
scription of the environmental impacts of a deﬁned product sys-
tem in terms of the effects on the most appropriate individual 
categories, together with an indication of how signiﬁcant that 
impact is for each category. There is no scientiﬁc basis for re-
ducing LCA results to a single overall score or number (ISO, 
1997) and, similarly, there is little justiﬁcation for closely rank-
ing impacts (although it is worth noting when one impact, such 
as that on climate change, clearly outweighs the rest). A data 
documentation format for Life Cycle Assessments has been de-
veloped (ISO, 2002) to facilitate common input. Data collec-
tion formats have also been developed for speciﬁc applications, 
such as motor vehicle manufacture (Finkbeiner et al., 2003) and 
plastics (O’Neill, 2003) and, similarly, large consistent databas-
es are now sold (for example at www.ecoinvent.ch/).
 
It is difﬁcult to characterize the uncertainty in LCA; there 
are a large number of variables with varying degrees of au-
tocorrelation and for which formal uncertainty analyses may 
not exist. However, it should be possible to perform sensitiv-
ity analyses with comparatively little effort so as to provide a 
commentary on the signiﬁcance of the impacts determined in 
the assessment (Ross et al., 2002). The requirements for data 
quality assessment are described in ISO (1997, 1998, 2000b).
 
In order to facilitate complete LCA studies involving re-
frigerants and foam blowing agents, several studies have been 
performed to characterize the environmental impacts of ﬂuid 
manufacture. The general conclusion was that the impact from 
producing the ﬂuids was small compared to that arising from 
their use during service and their eventual disposal (Banks et 
al., 1998; Campbell and McCulloch, 1998; McCulloch and 
Campbell, 1998; McCulloch and Lindley, 2003). The most sig-
niﬁcant contribution to the impact for producing ﬂuids comes 
from material, such as other ﬂuorocarbons, released during the 
manufacturing process and there is a wide variation in the val-
ues used. The highest values were calculated by Banks et al. 
(1998) who used maximum permitted emissions rather than 
real values. The other studies used actual process records so 
that the amount of material released was not only lower but 
also decreased substantially in recent years as the treatment 
of vent gases to avoid their release to the atmosphere became 
more commonplace, particularly in the new plants to manufac-
ture HFCs (Campbell and McCulloch, 1998; McCulloch and 
Campbell, 1998; McCulloch and Lindley, 2003).
 
As for studies of complete systems, Yanagitani and Kawahari 
(2000) conﬁrmed that for air-conditioning systems the larg-
est source of environmental impact arose from energy use, but 
that proper waste management at end-of-life could signiﬁcantly

reduce the impact. The predominant inﬂuence of energy pro-
duction on the impact on global warming, acidiﬁcation, aquatic 
ecotoxicity, photochemical ozone creation, terrestrial toxicity 
and the proliferation of radionuclides was demonstrated by 
Frischknecht (1999) in LCA studies of generic heat pumps, 
building air conditioning, and industrial and commercial refrig-
eration. 
3.5.2.4 
Other system-based approaches
Environmental burden
Environmental burden is a method for assessing the environ-
mental impact of a production facility. Mass emissions of in-
dividual compounds released from the site are multiplied by a 
‘potency’ that characterizes the impact of the compound on a 
particular environmental end-point (for example ozone deple-
tion or global warming). The sum of these values in each impact 
category is the environmental burden of the facility (Allen et 
al., 1996). The resulting site-speciﬁc review of environmental 
impact can be used in environmental management (as described 
in ISO 14001).
Eco-efﬁciency
This combines Life Cycle Assessment of similar products or 
processes with a total cost determination of each alternative. 
Economic and ecological data are plotted on an x/y graph, with 
costs shown on the horizontal axis and the environmental im-
pact on the vertical axis. The graph reveals the eco-efﬁciency of 
a product or process compared to other products or processes, 
with alternatives that have high cost and high impact occupying 
the upper right-hand quadrant. Similarly, those with low impact 
and low-cost occupy the lower left-hand quadrant, close to the 
origin. (BASF, 2003). However, such analyses demand a great 
deal of accurate data.
3.6 
Regional dimensions
The use of ﬂuorocarbons is speciﬁc to certain technical sectors. 
The technology selection in these sectors, their customers and 
product developments are inﬂuenced by a number of factors, 
which are of a local, national or regional nature (e.g. EU regu-
lation (COM(2003)0492), under preparation). In addition to 
technical requirements, those factors can also include cost, 
environmental considerations, legal requirements, health and 
safety issues, energy inputs and costs and market characteristics. 
Therefore prescriptions on how to arrive at these decisions 
are not possible, as each country, and each enterprise within 
it, must make its own decision. Against this background, this 
section presents some of the more general characteristics and 
considerations that will inﬂuence the choice of technology at 
both the national and enterprise levels. 
 
This section also highlights some of the regional differences 
that inﬂuence technology choice. For these purposes, countries 
are considered in groupings recognized under the Montreal 
Protocol, namely:
• Latin America and the Caribbean;
• Africa and the Indian Ocean;
• Asia/Paciﬁc region;
• Countries with economies in transition; and 
• Developed countries.
Table 3.11 gives an overview of regional variations in key 
methodological issues.
3.6.1 
Sector characteristics
3.6.1.1 
Refrigeration and air conditioning
Growth in the demand for refrigeration has paralleled the de-
mand for food preservation, processing, freezing, storage, 
transport and display, as well as ﬁnal storage in homes. The 
more centralized food production becomes, and thus further re-
moved from the consumer, the greater the amount of refrigera-
tion. Consequently, societies with a more complex food supply 
structure and countries with a higher urban population will have 
a higher demand for refrigeration than countries supplying food 
from more local sources. 
Large air-conditioning systems with capacities of about 1 MW 
cooling capacity upwards, are used in most of the large com-
mercial buildings, hospitals and hotels around the globe, irre-
spective of the local climate (UNEP, 2003c). The occurrence 
of such systems roughly matches the occurrence of the type 
of buildings described. Smaller air-conditioning systems are 
largely desired in countries with warm climates (UNEP, 2003c), 
but there is an increasing market for these in areas with a more 
moderate climate, for example Central and Northern Europe. 
Therefore, the inﬂuencing factors for the spread of such sys-
tems are the occurrence of high ambient temperatures, and high 
humidity, as well as available income. 
 
There is an almost universal preference for mobile air con-
ditioning, even in colder climates. The only limiting factor is 
the cost of the system, which typically has to be covered when 
purchasing the vehicle. Certain types of systems – refrigera-
tors, unitary air conditioning products and water chillers – have 
universal usage characteristics and can therefore be manufac-
tured in centralized facilities. This simpliﬁes quality control 
and reduces the likelihood of leaks, and thus the need for ser-
vice. Nevertheless, since high ambient temperatures create an 
increased demand for servicing due to higher mechanical stress 
on the systems and longer periods of operation, and considering 
that most repairs currently lead to emissions of the refrigerant, 
hot climates tend to have higher levels of refrigerant emissions 
than cooler climates. In other sectors, for example most com-
mercial refrigeration systems, the installations are too custom- 
or location-speciﬁc to be manufactured in a centralized facility, 
although research is underway to change this (UNEP, 2003c). 
 
Maintenance philosophies which encourage preventive 
maintenance of refrigeration equipment, have lower emissions 
and maintain a stable energy-efﬁciency performance. The de-
cision to have preventive maintenance or to request service

only in the case of system failures, is not only dependent on the 
labour costs but also the business culture and the use-speciﬁc 
importance of uninterrupted delivery of refrigeration capacity. 
Labour costs, business culture and the value of reliable services 
are country-speciﬁc.
 
The widespread use of refrigeration and air-conditioning 
technology, and the accompanying high demand for service 
and repairs, makes the diffusion of improved techniques im-
portant. However, the large number of servicing companies 
makes it difﬁcult to introduce new maintenance practices and 
to ensure that these are adhered to (UNEP, 2003c). Through the 
Montreal Protocol, networks of service technicians have been 
established in several countries for the diffusion of information 
within the service sector enterprises, and in some cases there 
are also mechanisms in place to facilitate a certain maintenance 
quality. For low-cost, factory-manufactured equipment, such 
as refrigerators or small- and medium-sized, air-conditioning 
systems, high labour costs reduce the demand for servicing 
and instead favour early replacement. Although this results in 
lower emissions during maintenance, there is the potential of 
repair-worthy systems being dumped in countries with a lower 
level of income. This further complicates the situation in poorer 
countries as ageing refrigeration systems tend to have higher 
emissions and energy consumptions, and require more frequent 
repairs (UNEP, 2003c). 
 
Methods of disposal at the end-of-life of the equipment 
also have implications for the life-cycle GHG emissions of 
the equipment. (IPCC, 2001b, Chapter 3 Appendix). Given the

widespread ownership of refrigeration systems and the high 
costs associated with recycling, appropriate disposal at end-of-
life is at present (2004) more the exception than the rule in most 
regions. However, several countries have established legisla-
tion requiring certain disposal practices, although enforcement 
is still generally a challenge. For example in Japan, a recent 
system of CFC coupons compulsorily acquired by car own-
ers when the car reaches end-of-life and are transferred to car 
dismantlers as they recover the ﬂuid, is not performing well 
(www.yomiuri.co.jp/newse/20030511wo12.htm). The need for 
enforcement is further ampliﬁed by the fact that users have pur-
chased the equipment many years, if not decades, before the 
disposal takes place, making data availability and the link be-
tween the manufacturer and the user fairly weak. 
 
Customs tariffs have, according to experience gained under 
the Montreal Protocol, not signiﬁcantly hindered the spread of 
new technologies. A further complication is the adherence to 
different national or regional regulations and standards, which 
are often mandatory in nature. These might not be compatible 
with the use of alternative technologies and their characteristics, 
or might hinder supplies of refrigerants and spare parts. These 
difﬁculties can be both substantial and long-lasting, thereby de-
laying the introduction of new technologies by several years. 
 
In the case of mass-produced refrigeration systems, in 
particular refrigerators and air-conditioning systems, high 
labour costs in some regions have made the migration of 
industrial production an issue. With decreasing freight tariffs, 
refrigerators are also being increasingly transported over long 
distances, although differences in local requirements mean that 
the product is less standardized than air conditioners. 
 
Investment capacities and interest to invest are also signiﬁ-
cant drivers for technology diffusion, for both manufacturers 
and consumers. Typically, manufacturers invest in new technol-
ogy in response to consumers’ demands and/or legal require-
ments7. For small manufacturers and technicians in the informal 
sector, investments are very complicated, especially as there are 
often few options for obtaining loans in many less-developed 
countries. 
3.6.1.2 
Foam sector
During the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, the con-
sumption of CFCs in foam manufacture was largely phased out, 
and these were replaced by different technologies. In closed-
cell rigid insulating foams, hydrocarbons including cyclopen-
tane, n-pentane, isopentane and blends have been widely used 
in foam subsectors, where energy efﬁciency, safety and product 
performance criteria can be met. In ﬂexible foams, CO2 (wa-
ter) technology has been successfully introduced. Currently, 
the most signiﬁcant uses of HCFCs (developing countries) and 
HFCs (mostly developed countries) are in rigid insulating foam 
subsectors, where safety, cost, product performance and energy 
conservation are important (UNEP-TEAP, 2003).
For closed-cell rigid insulating foams, a large portion of the 
blowing agent remains in the foam until the end of its useful 
life (UNEP, 2003b). Consequently, the disposal practice (land-
ﬁll compared with incineration) has a large inﬂuence on the di-
rect emissions from a system (i.e., a refrigerator or a building) 
insulated with foams blown with ﬂuorocarbons. Foam disposal 
requires collection from a large number of individual users or 
retrieval from a large quantity of mixed solid waste such as de-
molished building rubble. This is further complicated by the fact 
that, in some cases, the foams are integrated with other materi-
als, for example, when used as building material it is adhered to 
substrates. These factors will make collection a major logistical 
and legal undertaking, which has not been mastered except in 
certain subsectors like domestic refrigeration, and even there, 
only a few countries are implementing such measures (UNEP, 
2003b). As most foam products are lightweight compared to 
their volume, transportation costs prohibit their transportation 
over long distances, unless the foam is only a small fraction of 
the ﬁnal product or system (i.e., a refrigerator). Addition, the 
movement of foam products, in particular building insulating 
foams, is further hindered by building construction traditions 
and building code requirements, which differ signiﬁcantly be-
tween countries. 
3.6.1.3 
Solvents
The solvent sector is characterized on the one hand by the small 
scale, open use of solvents and on the other hand by use in 
industrial processes or closed machines. Both industrial uses 
and closed machine uses have undergone signiﬁcant improve-
ments as part of the efforts to reduce the use of ODSs under the 
Montreal Protocol. A completely different issue is the open use 
of solvents. For some open uses in medium-size consuming op-
erations, investments might lead to a transition towards closed 
uses with internal recycling of the solvents. In other uses, in 
particular cleaning in smaller workshops, the solvent will evap-
orate into the atmosphere. Low labour costs and, thus, less auto-
mated production tend to support the open use of solvents. As in 
the case of the refrigeration sector, the large number of users in 
non-homogenous solvent applications makes the spreading of 
know-how a complex and labour-intensive undertaking (UNEP, 
2003d). There are no substantial technical barriers to phasing 
out ODSs in the solvent sector. Alternatives are available that 
will meet the needs of all solvent users with very few excep-
tions. The main barrier to overcoming the obstacles in develop-
ing countries is communication and education about suitable 
alternatives. (UNEP, 2003d).
3.6.1.4 
Aerosols/MDIs
Since the beginning of the Montreal Protocol, most aerosol uses 
of ﬂuorocarbons have been converted to other motive agents, 
particularly hydrocarbons (UNEP, 2003e). Even so in Japan 
alone, 1850 tonnes of HFCs were distributed in about 4.5 mil-
lion cans in 2003. This is a considerable increase compared to 
the 1050 tonnes distributed in 1995. It is estimated that 80% of 
these cans are used to blow away dust. The ﬂuid used (HFC-

ment to replace it with a ﬂuid with a lower GWP (HFC-152a) 
are only slowly having an effect (www.asahi.com/english/busi-
ness/TKY200405270126.html). Furthermore, certain critical 
technical and/or laboratory uses of CFCs remain that are not 
controlled under the Protocol. For the users of such specialised 
aerosols the associated costs are less important. In these speciﬁc 
sectors, the introduction of alternatives to ﬂuorocarbons is very 
knowledge intensive. However, due to the limited number of 
manufacturers, the number of specialists needed for technol-
ogy transfer is limited (UNEP, 2003e). National legislation with 
respect to imports and standards is important because several 
products, in particular pharmaceuticals, need to adhere to na-
tional or regional standards. Most countries require intensive 
testing of new pharmaceuticals before the lengthy approval 
process is initiated and this can delay the introduction of new 
technologies. For all specialized products, manufacturers will 
often face very signiﬁcant investments for research and devel-
opment, testing, licenses and approval. The cost of converting 
production facilities to utilize alternative technologies could 
also be high.
3.6.1.5 
Fire protection
Fire protection is a knowledge-intensive sector, which only 
needs a few specialists to service the limited amount of facilities. 
The diffusion of new technologies can therefore be undertaken 
with a limited amount of effort. Appropriate servicing of ﬁre 
protection equipment and, where applicable, the subsequent 
appropriate disposal and destruction are key elements in the 
overall climate impact of these applications. The speciﬁc nature 
of this sector provides good opportunities for implementing 
containment measures for remaining applications, for example 
the banking of halons under the Montreal Protocol. For the in-
troduction of new technologies, ﬁre protection has a similar 
characteristic requirement to pharmaceuticals. The safe and 
efﬁcient use of the agents has to be proven before new tech-
nologies can be accepted. This can cause signiﬁcant delays in 
technology transfer. The costs of the systems are, within certain 
limits, secondary for the user because ﬁre protection systems 
are required and/or essential and form an integral part of the 
purchase of buildings, military equipment or aircraft. 
3.7 
Emission projections
HFC and PFC emissions arise from two distinct sources (pro-
cess emissions and releases when the product is in use (includ-
ing disposal)) that require different methodologies for account-
ing historic and current mass emissions or for projecting mass 
emissions in the future.
 
Process emissions that occur during chemical production 
are subject to pollution-control regulations in many countries. 
These originate from a relatively small number of large facili-
ties and are potentially simple to monitor. For example, there 
are some thirteen companies throughout the world that produce 
HCFC-22 and hence could be sources of the HFC-23 byproduct 
(AFEAS, 2003; EU, 2003). Together with their subsidiaries and 
associates, and the other independent facilities in a small num-
ber of developing countries, these constitute a set of 50 potential 
emission sites, which are point sources. A standard methodolo-
gy exists to monitor the release of HFC-23 from these facilities 
(DEFRA, 2003; IPCC, 2000a) and future emissions will depend 
on production activity and the extent to which byproducts are 
abated at the sources. 
 
Emissions arising during use of a ﬂuorocarbon, or on dis-
posal of the system containing it, occur over a much wider geo-
graphical area than the point source emissions described above. 
Furthermore, the losses are spread out over the service lifetime 
of the system with system-dependent rates of release; for most 
applications this will result in an emissions pattern that covers 
several years after the system is charged. Future releases will 
therefore depend on the release pattern from the current de-
ployment, future changes in the number of systems, how wide-
spread the use of ﬂuids is and the extent to which the ﬂuids are 
contained during usage and disposal. Methodological guidance 
is available for monitoring current releases of HFCs and PFCs 
from refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, foam blowing, 
aerosols, solvents and ﬁre-ﬁghting applications (IPCC, 2000a) 
and there is a standard methodological protocol for calculating 
releases from refrigeration systems (DEFRA, 2003).
 
Almost all predictions of future emissions are extrapolations 
of current quantities and trends and, the primary difference in 
methodology is the extent to which this is based on either:
a) An appreciation of the details of the market for the systems 
and the way those, and the emission rates of ﬂuids, will change 
in the future (bottom-up approach)8, or b) A view of the econo-
my as a whole and the emissions arising from the niches ﬁlled 
by HFCs and PFCs, so that trends are governed by overall eco-
nomic parameters (top-down approach).
3.7.1 
Process emissions
This category includes emissions of HFC-23 from the produc-
tion of HCFC-22 which, in recent years, has been the largest 
ﬂuorocarbon contribution to potential climate change. This 
release of HFC-23 is used to exemplify the requirements for 
forecasting emissions.
 
In general, process emissions can be related to process ac-
tivity:
 
Ei = Ai x Fi 
 
 
 
 
(3.12)
Where:
Ei is the annual emission in year i;
Ai is the activity in that year, and
Fi is a factor relating activity to emissions.
8 This terminology is widely applied but has a variety of meanings. In this part 
of the report, all predictions based on study of HFC and PFC markets will be 
called bottom-up. Top-down will be used only for predictions based on macr-
oeconomic parameters.

In the case of HFC-23, Ai is the annual rate of production of 
HCFC-22 for all uses, whether or not the HCFC-22 is released 
into the atmosphere or used as feedstock for ﬂuoropolymer 
manufacture; so that the calculation of future activity will be a 
projection of both dispersive and feedstock end-uses. The glob-
al estimates of the production of HCFC-22 for dispersive use 
that were made for comparison with atmospheric measurements 
(McCulloch et al., 2003) can be extrapolated in accordance with 
the provisions of the Montreal Protocol as outlined in Montzka 
and Fraser (2003). It is important that such estimates include the 
signiﬁcant changes in production in the developing world that 
are evident from UNEP (2003a). The ﬂuoropolymers are prod-
ucts in their own right and have different markets and growth 
rates from that of HCFC-22, which, in this case, is simply a raw 
material. These growth parameters will need to be extrapolated 
separately and explicitly for developed and developing econo-
mies in order to calculate a credible total activity.
 
HFC-23 (triﬂuoromethane) is formed at the reactor stage 
of the manufacture of HCFC-22 (chlorodiﬂuoromethane) as a 
result of over-ﬂuorination. Its formation is dependent upon the 
conditions used in the manufacturing process and amounts to 
between 1.5−4.0 % of the quantity of HCFC-22 produced. Its 
production can be minimized by optimizing process conditions 
but the most effective means of elimination is destruction by 
thermal oxidation (Irving and Branscombe, 2002). Thus, the 
emission factor Fi for HFC-23 lies between zero and 4%. Use 
of a single value (3%) as the default emission rate (Irving and 
Branscombe, 2002), although allowed in the methodology for 
calculating national greenhouse-gas emissions (IPCC, 2000a), 
is not likely to give a credible forecast. In many cases, actual 
HFC-23 emission rates are recorded in national greenhouse-gas 
inventories (UNFCCC, 2003) and these can be used as informa-
tion on the trends in emission rate (either the absolute rate or the 
rate relative to HCFC-22 production). It should also be possible 
to take into consideration national regulations that will affect 
such emissions in order to generate more robust predictions.
3.7.2 
Calculating releases of ﬂuorocarbons during use 
and disposal from sales data
Models used for extrapolation of emissions need to match 
historical data, including trends and, at the simplest level this 
means that the extrapolated data must start from the recorded 
baseline. Furthermore, the projections need to match the shape 
of the historical growth (or decline) in the sales from which 
emissions are calculated.
 
There is a long record of historic data for audited production 
for all of the major CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs (AFEAS, 2003). 
These data are consistent with the aggregated values for CFC 
and HCFC production and consumption reported under the 
Montreal Protocol (UNEP, 2002). The annual releases of CFC-
11 and CFC-12, HCFC-22 and HFC-134a have been calculated 
from the audited production and sales (which are reported in 
categories having similar emission functions), and been shown 
to be consistent with the atmospheric concentrations observed 
for these species (McCulloch et al., 2001; 2003). This indicates 
that the emission functions for these compounds from use in 
refrigeration, air conditioning, foam blowing, solvent applica-
tions and aerosol propulsion are robust. Comparisons between 
atmospheric concentrations and production or sales can also be 
used to reﬁne emission functions (Ashford et al., 2004).
 
The primary variables that respond to economic parameters 
are the activities for the product, which in this case is the use (or 
sales) of that product in the categories listed above. Emissions 
are then secondary variables calculated from the deployment 
in these categories (commonly called the banks) according to 
models of the time pattern of the extent of emissions. These 
time patterns may change in response to factors such as legisla-
tion (McCulloch et al., 2001).
 
Consideration of the long-term production databases for 
a wide range of industrial halocarbons, including CFCs and 
HCFCs, has shown that the compound growth model can be se-
riously misleading. It fails to replicate the shape of the demand 
curve over time for any of the materials examined (McCulloch, 
2000). This appears to be because it does not address the chang-
es which occur over the product lifetime. Therefore whereas 
growth during the early stages of product life may be com-
pound, and hence directly related to an economic parameter 
such as GDP, it assumes a linear relationship with time when 
the product becomes more mature and then starts to assume 
an asymptote at full maturity. As S-curve has been shown to 
best represent the actual shape of the demand curve over time, 
the curve used to describe the growth and decline of biological 
populations (Norton et al., 1976; McCulloch, 1994b, 1995b and 
1999). There is however no ﬁxed time cycle and some products 
reach maturity far sooner than others. In the short term (say ten 
to ﬁfteen years) it may be permissible to forecast future demand 
on the basis of a relatively simple function based on the histori-
cal demand. A product in its early life could be forecast to grow 
at a rate governed by the growth in GDP (the compound growth 
model); similarly, one that has reached more mature status may 
have a linear growth rate, increasing by the same mass rate each 
year. The completely mature product will have reached a con-
stant demand (and may, in fact, be subject to falling demand if 
there is replacement technology).
3.7.3 
Modelling future sales and emissions from bottom-
up methodologies
The ﬁrst step is to construct a history of the demand for the ma-
terial in its individual end-uses, both those where it is currently 
used and those where it has the potential to be used. These de-
mands may then be extrapolated from starting points that reﬂect 
the current status. Although it is possible, given sufﬁcient re-
sources and access to much information that may be considered 
conﬁdential, to construct separate demand models for each new 
compound (Enviros March, 1999; Haydock et al., 2003), the 
most common methodology involves constructing models of 
the overall demand in a particular sector, for example hermetic 
refrigeration. Extrapolation of that demand into the future can be

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
based on a mathematical analysis of the prior changes in func-
tions with time (as outlined above in McCulloch, 1994b, 1995b 
and 1999) or on the application of an external economic func-
tion, such as a compound growth rate (for example the growth 
in GDP as detailed in McFarland, 1999). Although over the rela-
tively short time-period considered in this report (up to the year 
2015), the difference between linear and compound growth for 
future demand may be small, any robust model should show the 
sensitivity of the forecasts to assumptions about future growth 
rates and should justify those rates by reference to the historic 
growth or models of comparable systems.
 
Once a forecast for the overall demand for a function has 
been established, the extent to which the HFC or PFC is de-
ployed in that function can be estimated using a substitution 
fraction and a view of how that fraction might change in the fu-
ture. There is now a body of data that describes recent substitu-
tion fractions and the changes expected in the coming decades 
(Enviros March, 1999; Forte, 1999; McFarland, 1999; Harnisch 
and Hendriks, 2000; Harnisch and Gluckman, 2001; Haydock 
et al., 2003). The most accurate substitution data will be found 
by examining current technical data for each compound in each 
application. In almost all cases, the potential for substitution is 
greater than the actual extent of substitution. Enforced changes 
in technology have provided the opportunity to switch to com-
pletely different materials and techniques (the not-in-kind solu-
tions), to improve recovery and recycling (McFarland, 1999) 
and to signiﬁcantly reduce charge in each installation (Baker, 
1999). The requirements for continuing economic and environ-
mental improvements will serve to drive these in the direction 
of further reductions in the substitution fractions.
 
Emission functions, factors applied to the quantities of mate-
rial in use at each stage of the equipment life cycle, can also be 
predicted. In many studies the functions are based on AFEAS 
methodology, or variants of it. This allows for an initial loss, 
a loss during use and a ﬁnal loss on disposal (AFEAS, 2003; 
McCulloch et al., 2001, 2003; Haydock et al., 2003; Enviros 
March, 1999; Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). Default values for 
the emission functions for each category of end-use are provided 
in the IPCC Guidance on Good Practice in Emissions Inventories 
(IPCC, 2000a). However these emission functions have been 
shown to change in response to changes in technology and regu-
lations (McCulloch et al., 2001) and predictions should take this 
into account, either explicitly or as a sensitivity case.
 
Finally the future evolution of emissions for each compound 
may be calculated by combining the temporally developed 
emission functions with the forecast demands. This approach of 
building a quantiﬁed description of emissions from databases 
that can be separately veriﬁed, requires a large body of informa-
tion to be gathered. However, this can be reduced by making as-
sumptions and by estimating quantities and parameters by anal-
ogy. During the course of this process it will be relatively easy 
to identify the parts of the analysis that rely on such assump-
tions and to calculate the sensitivities of the results to changes 
in them. This is much more difﬁcult if ‘top-down’ methods are 
used because the assumptions are unlikely to be explicit.
3.7.4 
Modelling future sales and emissions using top-
down parameterization
This form of methodology uses forecast changes in major 
econometric parameters, such as GDP, to predict future emis-
sions. A typical example is the series of scenarios for future 
emissions of HFCs and PFCs contained in the IPCC Special 
Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC, 2000b).  Such long-term 
forecasts of emissions are desirable for predicting future cli-
mate change but the real implications of these forecasts need 
to be established and the predictions then need to be modiﬁed 
accordingly. 
 
One signiﬁcant advantage of top-down forecasting is that 
it depends on a parameter that should be common to all other 
forecasts of greenhouse-gas emissions − GDP or similar. It is 
therefore readily scaleableas expectations for the economic pa-
rameter change. However, the assumptions must be completely 
clear and the sensitivity of the result to changes in the assump-
tions must be an integral part of the analysis.
 
In the ideal case, the historical connection should be estab-
lished between economic parameters and the demand for re-
frigeration, insulation and other categories in which HFCs and 
PFCs can be used, so that the parameter with the best ﬁt can be 
chosen. Preferably, the analysis should be done on a regional or 
even a national basis, but it is unlikely that sufﬁcient data would 
be available for this. Then the same methodology as used in the 
bottom-up models should be applied to translate this demand 
into emissions of individual compounds. In the form of this 
model it is unlikely that the timing of emissions can be rigor-
ously estimated and so the sensitivity of the result to changes in 
the assumptions about the timing of emissions is essential. This 
allows the major failing of top-down models (that deviations 
from reality are perpetuated throughout the modelled period) to 
be addressed, with the possibility of making changes in the light 
of technological developments. 
Technology change, diffusion and transfer
In all forms of modelling it is essential to establish the drivers 
of technological change and to assess their effects on demand. 
In the case of refrigeration and air conditioning as a whole, 
continuing improvements to system engineering have resulted 
in signiﬁcant reductions in the absolute rates of leakage. In 
turn, this has allowed similar reductions in charge size, so that 
the inventory of refrigerants has been reduced together with 
the quantities required by original equipment manufacturers 
(OEMs) and for servicing. The scope for such reductions was 
reported in IPCC/TEAP (1999). Changes of this nature may 
originate in developed economies but is by no means conﬁned 
to them. Furthermore, the adoption of new technology in the 
rest of the world could be expected to accelerate as the manu-
facturing base shifts from North America, Europe and Japan 
towards developing economies.
 
Predictions of future emissions need to take into account the 
probability of technical change, in terms of both the primary 
innovation and its diffusion and transfer into the global manu-

facturing sector. At the very least analyses of the sensitivities 
to such changes should be incorporated, which address both 
the magnitude and rate of change, and take into account both 
geographical and economic factors. Ideally a system should be 
developed to simply calculate their effects on the predictions.
Uncertainty
As the results are predictions, formal statistical analyses have 
relatively little meaning. The key to the exercise is how well 
these predictions will match the future reality and this cannot 
be tested now. However, the models can be subjected to certain 
tests and the simplest is replicating the current situation; mod-
els that cannot match this from historic data are likely to give 
meaningless predictions. If the model output does match with 
reality, then the sensitivity of the result to changes in the his-
toric parameters will provide useful information for predictions 
of the future. Sensitivity analyses are likely to be the most that 
will be necessary. Given sufﬁcient resources it may be possible 
to apply Monte Carlo methods to the predictions in order to 
derive a more statistically rigorous uncertainty for the result. 
However, the value of going to such lengths is questionable 
bearing in mind that the models are based on assumptions and 
not observations.
3.8 
Outlook: Future methodological developments
Some of the assessment methodologies described in this chapter 
are very comprehensive. For example Life Cycle Assessment 
was developed for high volume products in mass markets and 
not for the customized systems found, for example, in commer-
cial refrigeration or ﬁre-protection. for certain areas of appli-
cation or regions, the amount of resources required for some 
of these assessment methods will probably be considered inap-
propriate. There is an evident need for simple and pragmatic 
assessment methods in many world regions. TEWI and LCCP 
analyses – using standard assumptions and boundaries – are 
likely to have a strong role in fulﬁlling this need. 
 
An important future task in using assessment methods such 
as TEWI and LCCP lies in achieving consistency and com-
parability among different studies from different authors and 
years. One example for this is the choice of weighting factors 
for the climate impact of emissions of different substances, for 
example, the choice of sets of GWP values which can come 
from the second or third IPCC assessment report or from other 
more recent sources, or the application of other metrics for the 
radiative impact of substance emissions (see Fuglestvedt et al. 
(2003) for an overview). It would therefore seem advisable for 
authors to publish enough interim results to allow the recalcula-
tion of modiﬁed parameters, such as more recent emission fac-
tors or values for indirect emissions from a country’s electricity 
production. 
 
In the past little attention was paid to ensuring the compa-
rability and transferability of results from different technology 
assessments. The treatment of uncertainties was often incom-
plete and the resulting recommendations were often not robust 
enough to be transferred across a sector. Researchers and the 
users of their results should therefore pay more attention to de-
termining the circumstances under which clear and robust con-
clusions on the relative performance of different technologies 
can be drawn, and on where uncertainties preclude such rank-
ings. Carefully designed and performed sensitivity tests of the 
results for variations of key parameters are crucial for obtaining 
these insights. 
 
In view of the many assumptions and different method-
ologies, an important role has been identiﬁed for comparisons 
between technologies using a common set of methods and as-
sumptions as well as for the development of simple and prag-
matic standard methodologies and the respective quality cri-
teria. A future international standardization of simple as well 
as more complex or comprehensive evaluation methodologies 
will be important. An advanced level of international consis-
tency has already been achieved in the ﬁeld of health and safe-
ty. However, international standardization processes consume 
considerable amounts of time and resources (from scoping, via 
drafting and review to ﬁnalization). More timely and ﬂexible 
processes will therefore be required as well. Whereas current 
standards are mainly based on low-toxicity, non-ﬂammable ﬂu-
ids, standardization committees must also prepare proper stan-
dards which consider the limits and conditions for the safe use 
of ﬂuids that are ﬂammable or show higher toxicity. An essential 
input for this is the global standardization of international levels 
of requirements in respect to health, safety and environmental 
performance as well as respective test methods and classiﬁca-
tions.
 
Policymakers need to have such information that is valid 
for entire sectors and this warrants additional methodology de-
velopment. Future work will need to bridge the gap between 
application-speciﬁc comparisons and results which are robust 
enough to be used for policy design in entire subsectors. These 
analyses will have to be based on extensive databases on equip-
ment populations, which comprise empirical data on ﬂuid emis-
sions and energy consumption. These databases should ideally 
be consistent and compatible with national greenhouse-gas 
emission inventories. Information on ﬂuid sales to the different 
parties involved in the subsector will need to be made available. 
Signiﬁcant resources will be required for these fairly compre-
hensive data requirements to support robust sectoral policies, 
and a number of resulting conﬁdentiality issues will need to be 
addressed cautiously. In their efforts to achieve acceptability 
across subsectors, decision-makers could focus on increasing 
the involvement of relevant stakeholders and introducing ad-
ditional measures to increase the transparency for outside users 
by means of more extensive documentation.
 
It is important to bear in mind that the methodologies and 
policies discussed above may be subject to misuse and neglect. 
For example, although industry uses such assessments, they 
are rarely determining factors in selecting a particular alterna-
tive. In fact, environmental assessment methods that are sensi-
tive to inputs are often employed to justify the suitability of 
a technology that has already been selected for other reasons.

Policymakers should therefore recognize other parameters in-
dustry uses to choose technologies, so that they are aware of the 
factors affecting the outcomes of an analysis and of the market 
forces which may counter the spirit of environmental policies.
 
Cost is clearly one of the most important factors driving 
decisions for or against certain technologies. Private decision-
makers usually take a life-cycle cost perspective based on their 
enterprises’ rules for depreciation times and capital costs for 
their investment. Policymakers commonly use different rules 
and parameters to judge the cost-effectiveness of different 
measures. As this Special Report has shown, there is still little 
public cost information available which policymakers can use 
to reach a judgement about the cost-effectiveness of measures. 
Many ﬁrms give considerably less weight to social costs than 
to private costs in making their decisions. Initial exploratory 
studies would seem to be a worthwhile means of ﬁlling this 
gap. In the future it might be useful to apply uniform costing 
methodologies with common standards for transparency and 
data quality.
 
In summary the following points can be highlighted as key 
results: 
A systems perspective is usually used to select a technology. 
This takes into account the system’s life-cycle costs, its energy 
consumption and associated emissions, health and safety im-
pacts, and other environmental impacts. The available assess-
ment methods for each of these attributes have been described 
in this chapter. These will often need to be adapted to the spe-
ciﬁc application region concerned. A decision-maker can avoid 
inconsistencies by initiating concerted technology comparisons 
of competing technologies under common rules. In any case 
decision-makers need to make their decisions in the light of 
the remaining uncertainties and limitations of the available as-
sessment methods, such as Total Equivalent Warming Impact 
(TEWI), the Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) or a Life 
Cycle Assessment (LCA).
 
Ensuring the faithful application of existing assessment 
methodologies by all players in order to provide information 
relevant for decisions, is an ongoing challenge. A decision-
maker may want to ensure that the full life cycle of the appli-
cation has been considered, that all relevant stakeholders have 
been involved in the scoping and execution of the analysis and 
in the review of its results, that accepted emissions monitoring 
protocols have been applied for direct and indirect emissions, 
that all costs are properly accounted based in the best available 
ﬁgures, and that the uncertainties, sensitivities and limitations 
of the analysis have all been clearly identiﬁed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Domestic refrigeration
Domestic refrigerators and freezers are used throughout the 
world for food storage in dwelling units and in non-commercial 
areas such as ofﬁces. More than 80,000,000 units are produced 
annually with internal storage capacities ranging from 20 litre 
to greater than 850 litre. With an estimated average unit lifes-
pan of 20 years, this means there is an installed inventory of 
approximately 1500 million units. As a result of the Montreal 
Protocol, manufacturers initiated transition from CFC refrig-
erant applications during the early 1990s. This transition has 
been completed in developed countries and signiﬁcant progress 
has been made in developing countries. The typical lifespan for 
domestic refrigerators means that products manufactured using 
CFC-12 refrigerant still comprise approximately one-half of 
units in the installed base. This has signiﬁcantly slowed down 
the rate of reduction in the demand for CFC-12 refrigerant in 
the servicing sector. 
 
Isobutane (HC-600a) and HFC-134a are the dominant al-
ternative refrigerants for replacing CFC-12 in new domestic 
refrigeration appliances. Each of these has demonstrated mass 
production capability for safe, efﬁcient, reliable and economic 
use. Both refrigerants give rise to similar product efﬁciencies. 
Independent studies have concluded that application design 
parameters introduce more efﬁciency variation than that at-
tributable to the refrigerant choice. Comprehensive refrigerant 
selection criteria include safety, environmental, functional, cost 
and performance requirements. The choice of refrigerant can 
be strongly inﬂuenced by local regulatory and litigation envi-
ronments. Each refrigerator typically contains 50−250 grams 
of refrigerant contained in a factory-sealed hermetic system. A 
simpliﬁed summary of the relative technical considerations for 
these two refrigerants is:
• HC-600a uses historically familiar mineral oil lubricants. 
Manufacturing processes and designs must fully take into 
account the ﬂammable nature of the refrigerant. For exam-
ple, the need for proper factory ventilation and appropriate 
electrical equipment, preventing leaking refrigerant from 
gaining access to electrical components, using sealed or 
non-sparking electrical components, and the use of proper 
brazing techniques or preferably the avoidance of brazing 
operations on charged systems. Service procedures must 
similarly include appropriate precautions for working with 
ﬂammable refrigerants;
• HFC-134a 
uses 
moisture-sensitive 
polyolester 
oils. 
Manufacturing processes should ensure that low moisture 
levels are maintained. Long-term reliability requires a more 
stringent avoidance of contaminants during production or 
servicing compared to either CFC-12 or HC-600a practices.
The use of the hydrocarbon blend propane (HC-290)/isobutane 
(HC-600a) allows CFC-12 volumetric capacity to be matched 
and avoids the capital expense of retooling compressors. These 
blends introduce manufacturing complexities and require the 
use of charging techniques suitable for refrigerant blends which 
have components with different boiling points. The application 
of these blends in Europe during the 1990s was an interim step 
towards the transition to HC-600a using retooled compressors. 
The same safety considerations apply to hydrocarbon blends as 
to HC-600a. 
 
Alternative refrigeration technologies such as the Stirling 
cycle, absorption cycle, thermoelectrics, thermionics and ther-
moacoustics continue to be pursued for special applications or 
for situations with primary drivers that differ from conventional 
domestic refrigerators. These technology options are not ex-
pected to signiﬁcantly alter the position of vapour compression 
technology as the choice for domestic refrigeration. 
 
Vapour compression technology is mature and readily 
available worldwide. The availability of capital resources is 
dictating the timing of conversion to HC-600a and HFC-134a. 
Current technology designs typically use less than half the elec-
trical energy required by the units they replace. This reliable 
performance is provided without resorting to higher cost or 
more complex designs. Continued incremental improvements 
in unit performance and/or energy efﬁciency are anticipated. 
Government regulations and voluntary agreements on energy 
efﬁciency and labelling programmes have demonstrated their 
effectiveness in driving improved efﬁciency product offerings 
in several countries.
 
Good design and the implementation of good manufactur-
ing and service practices will minimize refrigerant emissions; 
however, special attention must be given to the retirement of 
the large number of units containing CFC-12. With a typical 20-
year lifespan, refrigerator end-of-life retirement and disposal 
happens to about 5% of the installed base each year. This means 
approximately 75 million refrigerators containing 100 grams 
per unit, or 7500 total tonnes of refrigerant are disposed of an-
nually. This refrigerant will be predominantly CFC-12 for at 
least another 10 years. The small refrigerant charge means that 
refrigerant recovery is not economically justiﬁable. Regulatory 
agencies around the world have therefore provided incentives 
or non-compliance penalties to promote recovery of this ODS. 
 
In 2002, the total amount of refrigerants banked in domestic 
refrigeration amounted to 160,000 tonnes, with annual refriger-
ant emissions of 5.3% of banked system charge. The annualized 
HFC emissions rate from this sector was 1.0% in 2002. HFC 
emissions mostly occur during useful life. Production transition 
to HFCs started during 1995; consequently in 2002 the installed 
product age was 7 years or less compared to a typical lifespan 
of 20 years. Further, recovery during service and disposal is 
required in most early conversion countries.
 
Commercial refrigeration
Commercial refrigeration makes fresh and frozen food avail-
able to customers at the appropriate temperature levels: chilled 
food in the range of 1°C−14 °C and frozen food in the range of 
–12°C to –20°C.
 
On a global basis, commercial refrigeration is the refrigera-
tion subsector with the largest refrigerant emissions calculated

as CO2-equivalents. This amounts to 40% of the total annual 
refrigerant emissions, see Table 11.5. In 2002 worldwide com-
mercial refrigeration emission rates were reported to be 30%  
yr-1 of the installed commercial refrigeration banked inventory 
of 605,000 tonnes refrigerant. This means that in an environ-
ment with an average energy mix, the refrigerant emissions rep-
resent about 60% of the total emissions of GHG resulting from 
system operation, the rest being indirect emissions caused by 
power production. 
 
Refrigeration equipment types vary considerably in terms 
of size and application. Stand-alone equipment consists of sys-
tems where the components are integrated, such as beverage 
vending machines, ice cream freezers and stand-alone display 
cases. Refrigerant charge sizes are small (0.2–1 kg), and the 
CFCs CFC-12 and R-502 are being replaced by HFCs HFC-
134a, R-404A and R-507A. HCFC-22 is also used, but is sub-
ject to phase-out requirements. Refrigerant emissions are low 
in these mainly hermetic systems and are  similar to domestic 
refrigerator emissions. However, end-of-life recovery is almost 
non-existent on a global basis and this results in an average 
annual leakage of 7−12% of the refrigerant charge, dependent 
on the equipment lifetime. Some stand-alone equipment us-
ing hydrocarbons as refrigerants have been developed and are 
available in European countries, with refrigerant charge sizes 
in accordance with the limitations imposed by European and 
national safety standards.  
 
Condensing units are small commercial systems with com-
pressors and condensers located external to the sales area, and 
the evaporators located in display cases in the sales area, or in 
a cold room for food storage. These units are installed in shops 
such as bakeries, butchers and convenience stores as well as in 
larger food retailer stores. Similar refrigerants are used in these 
applications as in stand-alone equipment; however, with the 
larger refrigerant charges in these systems (1−5 kg), hydrocar-
bon refrigerant applications may be limited by national safety 
standards. Refrigerant emissions depend on the robustness of 
the system design, installation, monitoring and refrigerant re-
covery at end of equipment lifetime.
 
Full supermarket systems can be categorized by whether 
refrigerant evaporation occurs in the display cabinets and cold 
stores, or whether a low-temperature, secondary heat transfer 
ﬂuid that is cooled centrally, is circulated to the display cabinets 
and cold stores. The ﬁrst type is termed a direct system and the 
second type an indirect system.
 
Supermarket centralized direct systems consist of a series 
of compressors and condensers located in a remote machinery 
room, providing a cooling medium to display cabinets and cold 
storage rooms in other parts of the building. The size of sys-
tems can vary from cooling capacities of 20 kW to more than 
1 MW, as used in larger supermarkets. Refrigerant charge sizes 
can range from 100−2000 kg. The most common form of cen-
tralized system is direct expansion. Speciﬁc units can be dedi-
cated to low-temperature or medium-temperature evaporators. 
HCFC-22 continues to be extensively used in these systems, 
with R-502 for low-temperature applications being replaced by 
R-404A and R-507A. Due to European regulations on HCFCs 
that have been in force since January 2001, R-404A and R-
507A are the most commonly used refrigerants for large capac-
ity low- and medium-temperature systems in Europe. 
 
The ‘distributed’ system is a variation of the direct system. 
In this the compressors are located in sound-proof boxes near 
the display cases, permitting the shortening of refrigerant cir-
cuit length and a corresponding 75% reduction of refrigerant 
charge. Condensing units can be air-cooled or water-cooled. 
When compressor systems are installed as small packs with 
roof-mounted, air-cooled condensers, or as small packs adjacent 
to the sales area in conjunction with remote air-cooled condens-
ers, they are sometimes referred to as close coupled systems. 
The refrigerants used are mainly HCFC-22 and the low-temper-
ature refrigerants R-404A and R-507A. Other refrigerants such 
as R-410A are also being considered. With the close-coupled 
system design, refrigerant emissions are estimated to be 5−7% 
of charge on an annual basis. Compared to the centralized sys-
tems, the absolute reduction in refrigerant emissions is much 
greater due to the considerable reduction in refrigerant charge 
size.
 
The design of indirect systems for supermarkets permits re-
frigerant charge size reduction of 75−85%. Fluorocarbon-based 
refrigerants are generally used in these systems. However, if the 
centralized refrigeration system can be located in a controlled-
access room away from the customer area, indirect systems 
may also use ﬂammable and/or toxic refrigerants, dependent 
on system safety measures and national safety regulations. 
Refrigerant emissions are reduced to about 5% of charge yr-1 
due to the reductions in the reduced piping lengths and the num-
ber of connecting joints.
 
Systems that use ammonia and hydrocarbons as primary re-
frigerants in indirect systems operate in several European coun-
tries. Published results show that ammonia and hydrocarbon 
indirect systems have a 10−30% higher initial cost than direct 
expansion systems and an energy consumption 0−20% higher 
than that of direct expansion systems, due to the additional sys-
tem requirements (heat exchanger and circulating pumps with 
their costs and energy penalties). Development work on indi-
rect systems design is continuing with the goals of reducing the 
cost and energy penalties in these systems. 
 
Carbon dioxide is being evaluated in direct systems for both 
low- and medium-temperature applications, and in cascade 
systems with carbon dioxide at the low-temperature stage and 
ammonia or R-404A at the medium-temperature stage. Thirty 
cascade systems have been installed in supermarkets and the 
initial costs and energy consumption are reported to be similar 
to R-404A direct expansion systems. 
 
Important considerations in the selection of designs for 
supermarket refrigeration systems and refrigerants are safety, 
initial cost, operating cost and climate change impact (refriger-
ant emissions and carbon dioxide from electricity produced to 
operate the refrigeration systems). In the 1980s the centralized 
direct systems had annual refrigerant emissions up to 35% of 
charge. Recent annualized emission rates of 3−22% (average

18%) were reported for 1700 supermarket systems in several 
European countries and the USA. The reduced emission rates 
were due to a combination of factors aimed at improving refrig-
erant containment, such as system design for tightness, main-
tenance procedures for early detection and repairs of leakage, 
personnel training, system leakage record keeping, end-of-life 
recovery of refrigerant and in some countries, increasing the 
use of indirect cooling systems.
 
In 2002, worldwide commercial refrigeration emission rates 
were reported to be 30% yr-1 of the installed commercial re-
frigeration banked inventory of 605,000 tonnes of refrigerant. 
The higher worldwide emission rates indicate less attention was 
paid to refrigerant containment and end-of-life recovery than in 
the limited survey data reported above.
 
Traditional supermarket centralized direct systems must 
be designed for lower refrigerant emissions and higher energy 
efﬁciency in order to reduce climate change impact. From an 
overall perspective, signiﬁcant research and development is un-
derway on several designs of supermarket refrigeration systems 
to reduce refrigerant emissions, use lower global-warming re-
frigerants and reduce energy consumption. Life cycle climate 
performance calculations indicate that direct systems using al-
ternative refrigerants, distributed systems, indirect systems and 
cascade systems employing carbon dioxide will have signiﬁ-
cantly lower CO2-equivalent emissions than centralized direct 
systems that have the above-stated, historically-high refrigerant 
emission rates. 
Food processing, cold storage and industrial refrigeration
 
Food processing and cold storage is one of the important 
applications of refrigeration for preserving and distributing food 
whilst keeping food nutrients intact. This application of refrig-
eration is very signiﬁcant in terms of size and economic impor-
tance in both developed and developing countries. The annual 
consumption of frozen food worldwide is about 30 Mtonnes 
yr-1. Over the past decade, consumption has increased by 50% 
and is still growing. The amount of chilled food is about 10−12 
times greater than the supply of frozen products. Frozen food 
in long-term storage is generally kept at –15°C to –30°C, while 
–30°C to –35°C is typical for freezing. Chilled products are 
cooled and stored at temperatures from –1°C−10°C.
  
The majority of refrigeration systems for food processing 
and cold storage are based on reciprocating and screw com-
pressors. Ammonia, HCFC-22, R-502 and CFC-12 are the re-
frigerants historically used, with other refrigerant options being 
HFCs, CO2 and hydrocarbons. HFC refrigerants are being used 
instead of CFC-12, R-502 and HCFC-22 in certain regions. 
The preferred HFCs for food processing and cold storage ap-
plications are HFC-134a and HFC blends with an insigniﬁ-
cant temperature glide such as R-404A, R-507A and R-410A. 
Ammonia/CO2 cascade systems are being introduced in food 
processing and cold storage. 
 
Some not-in-kind (non-vapour compression) technologies, 
such as vapour absorption technology and compression-ab-
sorption technology, can be used for food processing and cold 
storage applications. Vapour absorption technology is well es-
tablished, whereas compression-absorption technology is still 
under development.
 
For this category, limited data are available on TEWI/LCCP. 
A recent study of system performance and LCCP calculations 
for a 11 kW refrigeration system operating with R-404A, R-
410A and HC-290 showed negligible differences in LCCP, 
based on the assumptions used in the calculations.
  
Industrial refrigeration includes a wide range of cooling 
and freezing applications in the chemical, oil and gas industries 
as well as in industrial ice-making, air liquefaction and other re-
lated industry applications. Most systems are vapour compres-
sion cycles, with evaporator temperatures ranging from 15°C 
down to –70°C. Cryogenic applications operate at even lower 
temperatures. Capacities of units vary from 25 kW to 30 MW, 
with systems often being custom made and erected on-site. 
Refrigerant charge size varies from 20−60,000 kg. The refrig-
erants used are preferably single component or azeotropes, as 
many of the systems use ﬂooded evaporators to achieve high ef-
ﬁciency. Some designs use indirect systems (with heat transfer 
ﬂuids) to reduce refrigerant charge size and to the risk of direct 
contact with the refrigerant. 
 
These refrigeration systems are normally located in indus-
trial areas with limited public access, and ammonia is the main 
refrigerant. The second refrigerant in terms of volume use is 
HCFC-22, although the use of HCFC-22 in new systems is 
forbidden for all types of refrigerating equipment by European 
regulations since January 2001. Smaller volume CFC refriger-
ants CFC-12 and R-502 are being replaced by HFC-134a and 
R-404A, and R-507A and R-410A. CFC-13 and R-503 are be-
ing replaced by HFC-23 and R-508A or R-508B. HCFC-22 is 
being replaced by R-410A, as the energy efﬁciency of R-410A 
is slightly higher than that of HCFC-22. The energy efﬁciency 
of R-410A can be similar to that of ammonia for evaporation 
temperatures down to –40°C, dependent on the compressor ef-
ﬁciency. Hydrocarbon refrigerants have historically been used 
in large refrigeration plants within the oil and gas industry. 
 
Carbon dioxide is another non-HFC refrigerant which is 
starting to be used in industrial applications, as the energy ef-
ﬁciency of carbon dioxide systems can be similar to that of 
HCFC-22, ammonia and R-410A in the evaporator temperature 
range of –40°C to –50°C for condensing temperatures below 
the 31°C critical temperature of carbon dioxide. Cascade sys-
tems with ammonia in the high stage and carbon dioxide in the 
low stage show favourable cost and energy efﬁciency. Carbon 
dioxide is also being used as a heat-transfer ﬂuid in indirect 
systems. 
 
Attempts are being made to reduce refrigerant emissions 
in industrial refrigeration, food processing and cold storage by 
improving the system design, minimizing charge quantities, 
ensuring proper installation, improving the training of service 
personnel with respect to the detection of potential refrigerant 
leakage, and improving procedures for recovery and re-use of 
refrigerant. The total amount of refrigerants banked in the com-
bined sectors of industrial refrigeration, food processing and

cold storage was 298,000 tonnes in 2002, with ammonia at 35% 
and HCFC-22 at 43% of the total banked inventory. Annual re-
frigerant emissions were 17% of banked system charge. 
Transport refrigeration
Transport refrigeration consists of refrigeration systems for 
transporting chilled or frozen goods. Transport takes place by 
road, rail, air and sea; further, containers as refrigerated systems 
are used with moving carriers. All transport refrigeration sys-
tems must be sturdily built to withstand movements, vibrations 
and accelerations during transportation, and be able to operate 
in a wide range of ambient temperatures and weather condi-
tions. Despite these efforts, refrigerant leakage continues to be 
a common issue. It is imperative that refrigerant and spare sys-
tem parts are available on-board and along the transport routes. 
Ensuring safe operation with all working ﬂuids is essential, par-
ticularly in the case of ships where there are limited options for 
evacuation. 
 
Ships with cargo-related, on-board refrigeration systems 
have either refrigerated storage spaces or provide chilled air 
supply. There are about 1100 such ships, with HCFC-22 be-
ing the main refrigerant. In addition, there are approximately 
30,000 merchant ships which have refrigerated systems for 
crew food supply, again mainly using HCFC-22. Alternative 
refrigerants being implemented are R-404A/R-507A, R-410A, 
ammonia and ammonia/CO2. 
 
Refrigerated containers allow storage during transport on 
rail, road and seaways. There are more than 500,000 such con-
tainers that have individual refrigeration units of about 5 kW 
cooling capacity. Refrigerants in this sector are transitioning 
from CFC-12 to HFC-134a and R-404A/R-507A. 
 
Refrigerated railway transport is used in North America, 
Europe, Asia and Australia. The transport is carried out with ei-
ther refrigerated railcars, or, alternatively, refrigerated contain-
ers (combined sea-land transport; see Section 4.6.2) or swap 
bodies (combined road-land transport; see Section 4.6.4).
 
Road transport refrigeration systems (with the exception of 
containers) are truck-mounted systems. The refrigerants histori-
cally used were CFC-12, R-502 and HCFC-22. New systems 
are using HFC-134a, R-407C, R-404A, R-410A and decreasing 
amounts of HCFC-22. There are about 1 million vehicles in op-
eration, and annual refrigerant use for service is reported to be 
20−25% of the refrigerant charge. These high leakage rates call 
for additional design changes to reduce leakage, which could 
possibly follow the lead of newer mobile air-conditioning sys-
tems. Another option would be for systems to use refrigerants 
with a lower global-warming potential (GWP).
 
The non-HFC refrigerant hydrocarbons, ammonia and car-
bon dioxide are under evaluation, and in some cases these are 
being used for transport applications in the various sectors, with 
due consideration for regulatory, safety and cost issues. Fishing 
trawlers in the North Paciﬁc Ocean already use ammonia for re-
frigeration, with a smaller number of trawlers using R-404A or 
R-507A. Carbon dioxide is a candidate refrigerant for low-tem-
perature refrigeration, but the speciﬁc application conditions 
must be carefully considered. Carbon dioxide systems tend to-
wards increased energy consumption during high-temperature 
ambient conditions, which may be signiﬁcant when containers 
are closely stacked on-board ships, leading to high condensa-
tion/gas cooler temperatures because of lack of ventilation. In 
the case of reefer ships and ﬁshing vessels, a promising alter-
native technology is equipment with ammonia/carbon dioxide 
systems. These systems have similar energy efﬁciency to exist-
ing refrigeration systems but higher initial costs.
 
Low GWP refrigerant options will technically be available 
for transport refrigeration uses where ﬂuorocarbon refrigerants 
are presently used. In several cases, these low GWP options 
may increase the costs of the refrigeration system, which is an 
important consideration for owners of transport equipment. A 
technology change from an HFC, such as R-404A, to a low-
GWP ﬂuid will usually lead to a reduction of TEWI, if the en-
ergy consumption is not substantially higher than in existing 
systems. 
 
The total amount of refrigerants banked in transport re-
frigeration was 16,000 tonnes in 2002, with annual refrigerant 
emissions of 38% of banked system charge consisting of CFCs, 
HCFCs and HFCs.

Introduction
The availability and application of refrigeration technology is 
critical to a society’s standard of living. Preservation through-
out the food chain and medical applications are examples of 
key contributors to quality of life. Integrated energy consump-
tion information is not available, but this largest demand sector 
for refrigerants is estimated to use about 9% of world power 
generation capacity (Bertoldi, 2003; EC, 2003; ECCJ, 2004; 
EIA, 2004; ERI, 2003; UN-ESCAP, 2002, Table 1.1.9). This 
consumption of global power-generation capacity means that 
the relative energy efﬁciency of alternatives can have a signiﬁ-
cant impact on indirect greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. 
 
Refrigeration applications vary widely in size and tempera-
ture level. Sizes range from domestic refrigerators requiring 
60−140 W of electrical power and containing 40−180 g of re-
frigerant, to industrial and cold storage refrigeration systems 
with power requirements up to several megawatts and con-
taining thousands of kilograms of refrigerant. Refrigeration 
temperature levels range from –70oC to 15oC. Nearly all cur-
rent applications use compression-compression refrigeration 
technology. The potential market size for this equipment may 
approach US$ 100,000 million annually. This diversity has re-
sulted in unique optimization efforts over the decades, which 
has resulted in solutions optimized for different applications. 
For discussion purposes, the refrigeration sector is divided into 
the ﬁve subsectors:
• Domestic Refrigeration: the refrigerators and freezers used 
for food storage primarily in dwelling units;
• Commercial Refrigeration: the equipment used by retail 
outlets for holding and displaying frozen and fresh food for 
customer purchase;
• Food Processing and Cold Storage: the equipment to pre-
serve, process and store food from its source to the whole-
sale distribution point; 
• Industrial Refrigeration: the large equipment, typically 25 
kW to 30 MW, used for chemical processing, cold storage, 
food processing and district heating and cooling;
• Transport Refrigeration: the equipment to preserve and 
store goods, primarily foodstuffs, during transport by road, 
rail, air and sea.
Data in Table 4.1 indicate that the annualized refrigerant emis-
sion rate from the refrigeration sector was 23% in 2002. This 
includes end-of-life losses. There is a wide range of annual-
ized emissions from the ﬁve subsectors, from 5% for domestic 
refrigeration to 30% for commercial refrigeration to 38% for 
transport refrigeration. For commercial refrigeration, the 30% 
annual refrigerant emissions represent typically 60% of the to-
tal emissions of GHGs resulting from system operation, the rest 
being indirect emissions from power production. This indicates 
the importance of reducing refrigerant emissions from this sec-
tor, in addition to the importance of the energy efﬁciency of 
systems stated above.

Domestic refrigeration
4.2.1 
Background
Domestic refrigerators and freezers are used for food storage 
in dwelling units and in non-commercial areas such as ofﬁces 
throughout the world. More than 80,000,000 units are produced 
annually with internal storage capacities ranging from 20 litre 
to greater than 850 litre. With an estimated typical unit life of 20 
years (Weston, 1997), the installed inventory is approximately 
1500 million units. Life style and food supply infrastructures 
strongly inﬂuence consumer selection criteria, resulting in 
widely differing product conﬁgurations between different glob-
al regions. Products are unitary factory assemblies employing 
hermetically-sealed, compression refrigeration systems. These 
typically contain 50−250 g of refrigerant. 
4.2.2 
Refrigerant options
Conversion of the historic application of CFC-12 refrigerant in 
these units to ozone-safe alternatives was initiated in response 
to the Montreal Protocol. Comprehensive refrigerant selection 
criteria include safety, environmental, functional, performance 
and cost requirements. A draft refrigerant selection-decision 
map and a detailed discussion of requirements were included 
in the 1998 report of the Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, and 
Heat Pumps Technical Options Committee (UNEP, 1998). The 
integration of these requirements with other potential drivers 
such as global-warming emissions reduction, capital resource 
availability and energy conservation results in a comprehensive 
analysis of refrigerant options for strategic consideration. Two 
different application areas must be addressed: (1) new equip-
ment manufacture, and (2) service of the installed base. New 
equipment manufacture can be addressed more effectively, 
since the ability to redesign avoids constraints and allows op-
timization.
4.2.2.1 
New Equipment Refrigerant options
Most new refrigerators or freezers employ either HC-600a or 
HFC-134a refrigerant. Each of these refrigerants has demon-
strated mass production capability for safe, efﬁcient, reliable 
and economic use. There are no known systemic problems with 
properly manufactured refrigerator-freezers applying either of 
these primary options. The key variables inﬂuencing selection 
between these two refrigerants are refrigerator construction de-
tails, energy efﬁciency, building codes, environmental consid-
erations and the economics of complying with standards. Other 
selected alternative refrigerants or selected refrigerant blends 
have had limited regional appeal, driven by either niche appli-
cation requirements or by availability of suitable compressors 
or refrigerants. Some brief comments about selected refrigerant 
use are now given.

choice for CFC-12 refrigerant, as the lubricant in the hermetic 
system. Competent manufacturing processes are required for 
reliable application but cleanliness control beyond historic 
CFC-12 practices is not required. HC-600a has a 1.8% lower 
ﬂammability limit in air, increasing the need for proper factory 
ventilation and appropriate electrical equipment. This ﬂamma-
ble behaviour also introduces incremental product design and 
servicing considerations. These include preventing leaking re-
frigerant access to electrical components or using sealed or non-
sparking electrical components, using proper brazing methods 
or preferably avoiding brazing operations on charged systems, 
and ensuring a more robust protection of refrigerant system 
components from mechanical damage to help avoid leaks. 
 
HFC-134a refrigerant: HFC-134a applications require syn-
thetic polyolester oil as the lubricant in the hermetic system. 
This oil is moisture sensitive and requires enhanced manufactur-
ing process control to ensure low system moisture level. HFC-
134a is chemically incompatible with some of the electrical 
insulation grades historically used with CFC-12. Conversion to 
the electrical insulation materials typically used for HCFC-22 
applications may be necessary. HFC-134a is not miscible with 
silicone oils, phthalate oils, parafﬁn oils or waxes. Their use 
should be avoided in fabrication processes for components in 
contact with the refrigerant. Common items for concern are mo-
tor winding lubricants, cutting ﬂuids in machining operations 
and drawing lubricants. Careful attention to system cleanliness 
is required to avoid incompatible contaminants. Trace con-
taminants can promote long-term chemical degradation within 
the system, which can reduce cooling capacity or cause sys-
tem breakdown. Necessary process controls are not technically 
complex but do require competent manufacturing practices and 
attention to detail (Swatkowski, 1996).
Isobutane (HC-600a)/propane (HC-290) refrigerant blends 
The use of these hydrocarbon blends allows matching CFC-12 
volumetric capacity and avoids capital expense for retooling 
compressors. These blends introduce design and manufacturing 
complexities. For example, they require charging techniques 
suitable for use with blends having multiple boiling points. The 
use of HC-600a/HC-290 blends in Europe during the 1990s was 
an interim step towards a ﬁnal transition to HC-600a using re-
tooled compressors. Unique application considerations are con-
sistent with those discussed above for HC-600a.
Other refrigerants and refrigerant blends 
Example applications of additional refrigerants in new equip-
ment include HC-600a/HFC-152a blends in Russia, HCFC-
22/HFC-152a blends in China and HCFC-22 replacing R-502 
in Japan. These all are low volume applications supplementing 
high-volume primary conversions to HC-600a or HFC-134a 
refrigerant. Demand for all refrigerants other than HC-600a 
and HFC-134a totals less than 2% of all Original Equipment 
Manufacturer (OEM) refrigerant demand (UNEP, 2003). These 
special circumstance applications will not be further discussed 
in this report.
4.2.2.2 
 Service of existing equipment
Service options range from service with original refrigerant, to 
drop-in, where only the refrigerant is changed, to retroﬁt, which 
changes the refrigerant and other product components to ac-
commodate the speciﬁc refrigerant being used. Several binary 
and ternary blends of various HFC, HCFC, PFC and hydrocar-
bon refrigerants have been developed to address continuing 
service demand for CFC-12. These blends are tailored to have 
physical and thermodynamic properties compatible with the 
requirements of the original CFC-12 refrigerant charge. Their 
application has been successful and is growing. Some of these 
are near-azeotrope blends; others have disparate boiling points 
or glide. If refrigerants and lubricants other than original design 
speciﬁcation are proposed for use, their compatibility with the 
speciﬁc refrigerator-freezer product conﬁguration and its com-
ponent materials must be speciﬁcally reviewed. An extended 
discussion of domestic refrigerator service options was includ-
ed in the 1998 Report of the Refrigeration, Air Conditioning 
and Heat Pumps Technical Options Committee (UNEP, 2003). 
4.3.3 
Not-in-kind alternatives
Alternative refrigeration technologies such as the Stirling cycle, 
absorption cycle, thermoelectrics, thermoacoustics and magnet-
ic continue to be pursued for special applications or situations 
with primary drivers that differ from conventional domestic re-
frigeration. Two examples of unique drivers are portability or 
absence of dependence on electrical energy supply. The 1994 
Report of the Refrigeration, Air Conditioning and Heat Pumps 
Technical Options Committee concluded that no identiﬁed tech-
nology for domestic refrigerator-freezers was competitive with 
conventional compression-compression technology in terms of 
cost or energy efﬁciency (UNEP, 1994). The 1998 and 2002 
reports of this committee reafﬁrmed this conclusion (UNEP, 
1998; UNEP, 2003). No signiﬁcant near-term developments are 
expected to signiﬁcantly alter this conclusion.
4.2.4 
Energy efﬁciency and energy standards
Relative refrigerator energy efﬁciency is a critical parameter 
in the assessment of alternatives. In practice, similar refrigera-
tion system efﬁciency results from the use of either HFC-134a 
or HC-600a refrigerant. Independent studies have concluded 
that the relative energy efﬁciencies of these two primary al-
ternatives are comparable. Efﬁciency differences from normal 
manufacturing variation exceed the differences introduced by 
the refrigerant choice (Sand et al., 1997; Fischer et al., 1994; 
D&T, 1996; Wenning, 1996). Energy efﬁciency of a product 
is strongly inﬂuenced by conﬁguration, component hardware 
selection,”thermal insulation, heat exchange surfaces and con-
trol algorithms. Effective options are readily available from 
multiple commercial sources. The improved energy efﬁciency 
of domestic refrigeration products is a national initiative in 
several countries. Energy labelling and energy standards are 
both being effectively used to facilitate these initiatives. The

Collaborative Labelling and Appliance Standards Program 
(CLASP) maintains a website with substantive information 
including links to various national programmes (URL: http://
www.clasponline.org). 
Energy standards and tests procedures 
Energy test procedures provide the basis for energy regulations 
and labelling initiatives. These test procedures must be repro-
ducible and repeatable and should ideally provide an indica-
tion of energy consumption under consumer use conditions. 
They should also provide an effective amendment protocol to 
accommodate evolving product technologies. Test procedures 
have been developed by several global standards organizations. 
The tests are different, and the results from one should never 
be directly compared with the results from another. Each can 
provide a relative energy consumption value for the test condi-
tions speciﬁed. The interested reader is referred to instructive 
discussions and comparisons of energy test procedures, their 
limitations and their future needs (Bansal and Kruger, 1995; 
Meier and Hill, 1997; Meier, 1998).
4.2.5 
Consumption and consumption trends
Table 4.2 presents consumption of the three most used domestic 
refrigerator refrigerants during 1992, 1996 and 2000 (UNEP, 
2003). Table 4.3 presents consumption details by global re-
gion for the year 2000 (UNEP, 2003). New equipment conver-
sions from CFC-12 to ozone-safe alternatives are occurring in 
advance of the Montreal Protocol requirements. By the year 
2000, 76% of new unit production had been converted: 53% to 
HFC-134a, 21% to HC-600a and 2% to all other (UNEP, 2003). 
Subsequent developments have maintained this trend with an 
apparent increase in the percentage converting to hydrocarbon 
refrigerants. Two large market examples are the production in 
India converting to either HFC-134a or an HC-600a/HC-290

blend (UNEP, 2000) and some units converting from HFC-134a 
to HC-600a in Japan.
 
Conversion of the service demand has been less successful. 
Field service procedures typically use the originally speciﬁed 
refrigerants. The long useful product life (up to 30+ years for 
some units with an average around 20 years), large installed 
base (approximately 1500 million units) and uncertainties with 
ﬁeld conversion to alternative refrigerants have resulted in a 
strong continuing service demand for CFC-12. The estimated 
percentage of refrigerators requiring post-warranty service of 
the hermetically sealed system and replacement of the origi-
nal refrigerant charge at sometime during their service life is 
1% in industrialized countries and 7% in developing countries. 
In industrialized countries this demand is typically satisﬁed 
with reclaimed or stockpiled CFC-12 when not contrary to 
local regulations. (Note: ‘Reclaimed’ refrigerant refers to re-
covered refrigerant that has been puriﬁed to original speciﬁca-
tions. Unpuriﬁed recovered refrigerant should never be used in 
long-life domestic refrigerators. Probable impurities are likely 
to catalyze systems degradation and cause premature failures.) 
CFC-12 is normally the lowest cost refrigerant in developing 
countries. Regardless of location, use of the CFC-free refriger-
ant service blends mentioned above only becomes signiﬁcant 
when CFC-12 availability becomes limited. Since post-war-
ranty service is typically provided by small, independent busi-
nesses, reliable service demand data are not available. Further, 
the limited capital resources in developing countries promotes 
the labour-intensive refurbishing of units compared to retire-
ment and replacement with new units. This not only prolongs 
the phase-out of CFC-12, but also results in increased failure 
rates from the highly variable quality of workmanship. 
4.2.6 
Factors affecting emissions
A text-box example included in Chapter 3 of this report (see 
Table 3.5) tabulates emission factors which must be considered 
for comprehensive Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) or 
Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI) of domestic refriger-
ation design options. There are two general types of emissions: 
direct, which for discussion of the refrigerant choice are limited 
to the refrigerant itself; and indirect, which depends on the re-
frigerator design and the infrastructures of supporting services 
in the use environment (Sand et al., 1997). The emission of 
insulating foam blowing-agents is not addressed in this chapter. 
Insulating foam is addressed in Chapter 7 
Direct emissions 
Efﬁcient factory operations and effective process and product 
designs will minimize emissions at the start of the product life 
cycle. Signiﬁcant process variables include refrigerant trans-
fer and storage, charge station operations, maintenance proto-
cols and factory process efﬁciencies. Key refrigerator design 
variables include hermetic-system internal volume, number of 
joints, mechanical fatigue and abuse tolerance and, of course, 
the choice of refrigerant. Domestic refrigerators contain refrig-
erant in factory-sealed, hermetic systems. Once sealed, refriger-
ant emission can only occur if there is a product defect or qual-
ity issue. Typical examples are brazing defects or containment 
component fatigue. In all cases, excluding life-ending failures, 
the defect will require the product hermetic system to be re-
paired. Variables inﬂuencing emissions during service include 
refrigerant recovery procedure usage and efﬁciency, charge 
technique employed, technician training and technician work 
standards. Refrigerant recovery during service is practiced in 
many countries. The small refrigerant charge quantity, typically 
50−250 g per unit, make this recovery economically unattract-
ive. Regulations and non-compliance penalties are usually re-
quired to provide incentives for recovery. Audits and refrigerant 
charge logs can provide useful metrics for the quality of refrig-
erant recovery practices.
 
Clodic and Palandre (2004) have detailed worldwide refrig-
erant bank and emissions data for domestic refrigerators (see 
Table 4.1). CFC emissions for domestic refrigeration in 2002 
were estimated to be 8000 tonnes. HFC emissions for domestic 
refrigeration in 2002 were estimated to be 0.3% of the domes-
tic refrigerant bank, or 500 tonnes. Domestic HFC refrigerant 
emission estimates will have increased in 2015 to 3000−8000 
tonnes, dependent on the extent of refrigerant containment and 
recovery assumed. 
 
With a typical 20-year lifespan, refrigerator end-of-life re-
tirement and disposal happens to about 5% of the installed base 
every year. In quantiﬁed terms this means approximately 75 
million refrigerators containing approximately 100 g per unit 
or 7500 total tonnes of refrigerant are retired and disposed of 
annually. For the next few years, or possibly even decades, 
CFC-12-containing product will continue to be a signiﬁcant 
fraction of the waste stream. As is the case for service recovery, 
the small refrigerant charge makes end-of-life recovery uneco-
nomical. Equipment and procedures commonly used for refrig-
erant recovery during service can be used but recovery is more 
typically accomplished in central disposal locations. This al-
lows the use of faster, less labour-intensive procedures to mod-
erate recovery costs. Nevertheless, regulations and non-com-
pliance penalties normally provide incentives for this recovery. 
Regulating agencies in various global regions administer these 
requirements and are an appropriate source for further informa-
tion. 
Indirect emissions 
Product design affects indirect emissions through refrigerator 
operating efﬁciency, and ease of refrigerator disassembly and 
separation for recycling. Higher efﬁciency units consume less 
electricity which, in turn, proportionately reduces the emis-
sions derived from electrical power generation and distribution. 
Parameters inﬂuencing energy efﬁciency are fundamental de-
sign considerations such as heat exchangers, control efﬁcacy, 
refrigerant systems, heat losses, parasitic power demands such 
as fans and anti-sweat heaters and product safety. The design 
approaches taken and options selected are directly related to 
the desired product features, performance and regulatory en-

vironment. A comprehensive discussion of detailed design 
parameters is beyond the scope of this report. Information is 
commercially available from multiple sources. Example refer-
ences listing areas of opportunity are the UNEP Refrigerants 
Technical Options Committee assessment reports (UNEP, 
1994, 1998, 2003), the International Energy Agency energy ef-
ﬁciency policy proﬁles report (IEA, 2003) and the Arthur D. 
Little global comparative analysis of HFC and alternative tech-
nologies (ADL, 2002). Objective discussions of many options 
are contained in the Technical Support Documents of the US 
Department of Energy rulemakings for domestic refrigerators 
and freezers (US DOE, 1995). 
4.2.7 
Comparison of emissions from alternative 
technologies
HFC-134a and HC-600a are clearly the signiﬁcant alternative 
refrigerants for domestic refrigeration. Consequently, the sig-
niﬁcant global-warming emissions comparison for this appli-
cation sector is HFC-134a compared to HC-600a. An accurate 
comparison of these is very complex. The multiple and widely 
diverse product conﬁgurations available globally are the conse-
quence of consumer needs and choices. Comparative analysis 
results will be inﬂuenced by the example scenario selected and 
its assumed details. The available degrees of freedom are too 
high to achieve a comprehensive perspective within a manage-
able number of scenarios. Any single technical solution will not 
provide an optimized solution.
 
Harnisch and Hendriks (2000) and March (March, 1998) 
estimated the conversion cost from HFC-134a to HC-600a, 
expressed as unit emissions avoidance cost. Harnisch and 
Hendriks assumed no product cost or performance impact and a 
� 1 million per manufacturing site conversion cost which yield-
ed an avoidance cost of � 3.4 per tonne CO2-eq. March (1998) 
assumed higher product and development costs, also with no 
performance impact, which resulted in an avoidance cost of � 
400 per tonne of CO2. These two estimates differ by more than 
two orders of magnitude in direct emissions abatement costs 
with assumed equivalent indirect emissions. Table 4.4 summa-
rizes emission abatement opportunities with increased applica-
tion of HC-600a refrigerant in the three most common domestic 
refrigerator conﬁgurations. Estimates for manufacturing cost 
premiums, development costs and required implementation in-
vestments are also included. Emission abatement opportunities 
are based on Clodic and Palandre (2004). 
 
The objective is to assess the total emissions from direct and 
indirect sources. HC-600a clearly has the advantage of mini-
mizing direct GHG emissions. Indirect emissions can dominate 
overall results using some scenarios or assumptions. The ener-
gy consumption of basic HFC-134a and HC-600a refrigeration 
systems is similar. At issue is what product modiﬁcations are re-
quired or allowed when converting to an alternative refrigerant 
and what effect these modiﬁcations have on product efﬁciency 
and performance. This uncertainty is particularly applicable to 
larger, auto-defrost refrigerators where a trade-off between sys-
tem efﬁciency and other product attributes necessary to main-
tain product safety is not obvious. The consequences of trends 
in consumer purchase choices and their inﬂuence on the rate 
of emissions reduction are also difﬁcult to predict. LCCP and 
TEWI are powerful, complementary tools, but results are sen-
sitive to input assumptions. Assumptions should be carefully 
validated to ensure they are representative of the speciﬁc sce-

narios of interest.
 
Several investigators have analyzed total emission scenarios 
comparing HFC-134a and HC-600a for domestic refrigeration: 
• An Arthur D. Little, Inc. LCCP study (ADL, 1999) estimat-
ed that approximately 14 grams (10% of initial charge) of 
HFC-134a would be the total net lifetime emissions from a 
domestic refrigerator in the USA regulatory environment. 
Using US power generation emission data, this equates to 
a 0.3% energy consumption increase over a typical 20-year 
product life; 
• Ozone Operations Resource Group of the World Bank 
Report No. 5: ‘The Status of Hydrocarbon and Other 
Flammable Alternatives Use in Domestic Refrigeration’ 
(World Bank, 1993) cited TEWI assessments presented 
at the 1993 German National Refrigeration Congress in 
Nurnberg. Regarding the relative refrigerant selection ef-
fects, this TEWI analysis concluded that ‘The direct con-
tribution of HFC-134a to global warming … should not be 
given serious consideration within this rough estimate be-
cause it does not amount to more than a few percent of the 
indirect contribution caused by the energy consumption of 
the appliance’ (Lotz, 1993).
4.2.8  
Emission abatement opportunities
The following emission abatement opportunities are available 
for domestic refrigerators:
• Conversion to alternatives having reduced GWP: The refrig-
erant direct emission contribution ranges from less than 2% 
up to 100% of total emissions. Direct emissions of 100% re-
ﬂect the condition where the power generation and distribu-
tion infrastructure has zero dependence on fossil fuel energy 
sources. Direct emissions favour HC-600a over HFC-134a. 
Regional regulatory and product liability considerations 
can hamper the viability of HC-600a application. Indirect 
emissions depend upon relative product energy efﬁciency. 
Thermodynamic cycle efﬁciencies of the alternatives are 
comparable. Product efﬁciency is dependent upon design 
attributes required to accommodate the ﬂammability of 
HC-600a. There is no penalty with the cold-wall evaporator 
conﬁgurations common in Europe. Information concerning 
conﬁgurations commonly used for forced-convection, auto-
matic-defrost products is limited or proprietary;
• Reduction of refrigerant leakage during service life: Annual 
leakage rates for the factory-sealed, hermetic systems in do-
mestic units are typically less than 1%…This leakage typi-
cally drives service demand;
• Recovery of refrigerant during end-of-life disposal or dur-
ing ﬁeld repair: Approximately 5% of the installed base are 
retired each year. The annual service call rate is signiﬁcantly 
less than that. Recovery efﬁciency is a critical variable;
• Reduction of indirect emissions through improved product 
energy efﬁciency: The indirect emission contribution for do-
mestic refrigeration ranges from zero to more than 98% of 
total emissions. Current production refrigerators consume 
less than half the energy of the typically 20-year-old unit 
they replace. With a 5% yr-1 retirement rate, this translates 
to a 2.5% yr-1 improvement in indirect emissions from the 
installed base;
• Opportunities for reduced indirect emissions exist via im-
proved product energy efﬁciency. The IEA energy efﬁcien-
cy policy proﬁles report (IEA, 2003) estimated the potential 
improvements to be 16−26%, dependent upon product con-
ﬁguration. Average cost inﬂation was estimated to be � 23 
(US$ 31) for manufacturing and � 66 (US$ 88) for purchase. 
The report presents comparative Least Life Cycle Cost anal-
yses for alternatives. Arthur D. Little conducted Life Cycle 
Climate Performance studies of HFC and other refrigerant 
alternatives (ADL, 2002). Their report gives heavy domes-
tic refrigeration emphasis on the relative energy efﬁciency 
and Total Equivalent Warming Impact assessment of vari-
ous blowing-agent alternatives. 
4.3 
Commercial refrigeration
Commercial Refrigeration is the part of the cold chain compris-
ing equipment used by retail outlets for preparing, holding and 
displaying frozen and fresh food and beverages for customer 
purchase.
For commercial systems, two levels of temperature (medium 
temperature for preservation of fresh food and low tempera-
ture for frozen products) may imply the use of different refrig-
erants. Chilled food is maintained in the range 1°C−14°C but 
the evaporating temperature for the equipment varies between 
–15 °C and 5 °C dependent upon several factors: the type of 
product, the type of display case (closed or open) and the type 
of system (direct or indirect). Frozen products are kept at dif-
ferent temperatures (from –12 °C to –18 °C) depending on the 
country. Ice cream is kept at –18 to –20 °C. Usual evaporating 
temperatures are in the range of −30 to –40 °C.
 
On a global basis, commercial refrigeration is the refrigera-
tion subsector with the largest refrigerant emissions calculated 
as CO2 equivalents. These represent 40% of the total annual re-
frigerant emissions, see Table 11.5. Annual leakage rates high-
er than 30% of the system refrigerant charge are found when 
performing a top-down estimate (Clodic and Palandre, 2004; 
Palandre et al., 2004). This means that in an environment with 
an average energy mix, the refrigerant emissions might repre-
sent 60% of the total emissions of GHG resulting from system 
operation, the rest being indirect emissions caused by power 
production. This indicates how important emission reductions 
from this sector are. 
 
There are ﬁve main practices in order to reduce direct GHG 
emissions: 
1. A more widespread use of non-HFC refrigerants;
2. Leak-tight systems;
3. Lower refrigerant charge per unit of cooling capacity;
4. Recovery of refrigerant during service and end-of-life;
5. Reduced refrigeration capacity demand.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
4.3.1 
Sector background
Commercial refrigeration comprises three main types of equip-
ment: stand-alone equipment, condensing units and full super-
market systems. 
 
Stand-alone equipment consists of systems where all the 
components are integrated: wine coolers, beer coolers, ice cream 
freezers, beverage vending machines and all kinds of stand-
alone display cases. This equipment is installed in small shops, 
train stations, schools, supermarkets and corporate buildings. 
Annual growth is signiﬁcant. All types of stand-alone equip-
ment are used intensively in industrialized countries and are 
the main form of commercial refrigeration in many developing 
countries. These systems tend to be less energy efﬁcient per 
kW cooling power than the full supermarket systems described 
below. A main drawback to stand-alone units is the heat rejected 
to ambient air when placed indoors. Therefore, the heat must be 
removed by the building air conditioning system when there is 
no heating requirement.
 
Condensing units are used with small commercial equip-
ment. They comprise one or two compressors, a condenser 
and a receiver which are normally located external to the sales 
area. The cooling equipment includes one or more display 
cases in the sales area and/or a small cold room for food stor-
age. Condensing units are installed in specialized shops such 
as bakeries, butchers and convenience stores in industrialized 
countries, whilst in developing countries a typical application 
is the larger food retailers. 
 
Full supermarket systems can be categorized by whether 
refrigerant evaporation occurs in the coolers, or whether a low-
temperature secondary heat transfer ﬂuid (HTF) that is cooled 
centrally is circulated in a closed loop to the display cabinets 
and cold stores. The ﬁrst type is termed ‘direct expansion’ or 
direct system and the second type is termed indirect system. 
Direct systems have one less thermal resistance and no separate 
ﬂuid pumping equipment, which gives them an inherent efﬁ-
ciency and cost advantage. The HTF circulated in an indirect 
system normally gains sensible heat, but may gain latent heat in 
the case of ice slurry or a volatile ﬂuid like CO2.
 
Many different designs of full supermarket systems can be 
found. Centralized systems consist of a central plant in the form 
of a series of compressors and condenser(s) located in a ma-
chinery room or an outside location. This provides refrigerant 
liquid or an HTF at the correct temperature levels to cabinets 
and cold stores in other parts of the building. Each rack of mul-
tiple compressors is usually associated with a single air-cooled 
condenser. Speciﬁc racks are dedicated to low-temperature or 
medium-temperature evaporators. The quantity of refrigerant is 
related to the system design, refrigerating capacity and refriger-
ant choice varies. The centralized systems can be either direct 
or indirect systems. Centralized direct systems constitute by far 
the largest category in use in supermarkets today. The size can 
vary from refrigerating capacities of about 20 kW to more than 
1 MW. The centralized concept is ﬂexible in order to utilize 
heat recovery when needed (Arias, 2002).
Distributed Systems are characterized by having smaller com-
pressors and condensers close to or within the coolers, so that 
many sets of compressor/condenser units are distributed around 
the store. The compressors can be installed within the sales area 
with remote condensers. When they are installed as small packs 
with roof-mounted, air-cooled condensers, or as small packs 
adjacent to the sales area in conjunction with remote air-cooled 
condensers they are sometimes referred to as Close Coupled 
Systems. The quantity of such units could range from just a few 
to upwards of 50 for a large supermarket. They are direct sys-
tems, but when installed inside the building that may employ a 
HTF, usually water, for collecting heat from the different units.
 
Hybrid systems cover a range of possibilities where there 
is a combination of types. An example is a variation of the dis-
tributed system approach, where low-temperature cabinets and 
cold stores comprise individual water-cooled condensing units, 
which are supplied by the medium-temperature HTF. Thus, in 
the indirect medium temperature section, the refrigerant charge 
is isolated mainly to the machinery room, whilst an HTF is cir-
culated throughout the sales and storage areas at this tempera-
ture level. 
 
In some countries, indirect, close-coupled, distributed and 
hybrid systems have been employed in increasing number in 
recent years because they offer the opportunity of a signiﬁcant 
reduction in refrigerant charge. Additionally, with indirect sys-
tems the refrigerant charge is normally located in a controlled 
area, enabling the use of low-GWP refrigerants that are ﬂam-
mable and/or have higher toxicity. This approach has been 
adopted in certain European countries due to regulatory con-
straints on HCFCs and HFCs (Lundqvist, 2000). A review of 
possible system solutions is provided by Arias and Lundqvist 
(1999 and 2001). The close-coupled systems offer the advan-
tages of low charge, multiple compressors and circuits for part 
load efﬁciency and redundancy, as well as the efﬁciency advan-
tage of a direct system (Hundy, 1998).
4.3.2 
Population/production
There is a lot of variation in the geographical distribution of 
commercial refrigeration systems, even in neighbouring coun-
tries, due to differing consumption habits, regulation of open-
ing hours, leadership of brand names, state of the economy and 
governmental regulations.
 
A number of leading US and European manufacturers are 
expanding worldwide, especially into Eastern European coun-
tries and other countries with fast growing economies, such 
as: Argentina, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and 
Tunisia. The growth of all types of commercial refrigerating 
systems in China is one of the most signiﬁcant of the past 4 
years. For example, the number of small supermarkets (average 
total sales area of about 380 m2) has increased by a factor of six 
in the past 4 years.
 
Table 4.5 shows the average total sales area of supermar-
kets, which differs signiﬁcantly per country. The ‘hypermarket’ 
concept of selling food, clothing and all types of household

goods, is expanding worldwide. 
 
Table 4.6 shows an estimate of supermarket and hypermar-
ket populations and Table 4.7 an evaluation of the population of 
smaller commercial units.
 
It is only possible to evaluate the refrigerant quantities based 
on the number of supermarkets if additional data are used con-
cerning the total sales area of fresh and frozen food and the type 
of refrigerating system. Nevertheless in terms of the number 
of supermarkets, China represents more than 30% of the total 
global population of supermarkets (UNEP, 2003).
 
For small commercial supermarkets, China represents about 
40% of the total global population, with the exception of vend-
ing machines. The growth of vending machines is still very sig-
niﬁcant, especially in Europe (UNEP, 2003).
4.3.3 
HFC and HCFC technologies, current usage and 
emissions
4.3.3.1 
Refrigerant choices
Refrigerant choices for new equipment vary according to na-
tional regulations and preferences.
 
Europe: Following CFC phase out for new equipment and 
servicing in Europe, commercial refrigeration tended towards 
the use of HCFC-22 and HCFC-22 blends. However, in the 
Nordic countries, the period with HCFC-22 was very short, and 
HFCs such as R-404A became the preferred solution from 1996 
onwards. Since 2000, European Regulation 2037/2000 (Ofﬁcial 
Journal, 2000) has prohibited HCFCs in all type of new refrig-
erating equipment. HFC-404A and HFC-507A are now the 
most commonly used refrigerants for larger capacity low- and 
medium-temperature systems, such as condensing units and all 
types of centralized systems. For stand-alone systems, HFC-
134a is used for medium-temperature applications, while both 
HFC-134a and HFC-404A are used for low-temperature appli-
cations. 
 
Japan: In Japan where HCFCs are still permitted, a voluntary 
policy is followed by OEMs and more than one-third of new 
equipment employs HFCs, with the remainder using HCFC-
22. Typically, HFC-407C is used for medium temperature and 
HFC-404A for low temperature in all categories of commercial 
systems.
 
USA and Russia: In the USA, HCFC-22 and HCFC-22 
blends are commonly used in existing systems, primarily for 
medium-temperature applications. HCFC-22 continues to dom-
inate new supermarket systems, but HFC-404A and HFC-507A 
are becoming more widely used. HFC-404A and HFC-134a are 
used in new stand-alone equipment. These trends are also seen 
in Russia, where alternatives include HFC-134a, HCFC-22 and 
HCFC-22 blends as well as HFC-404A in a broad range of com-
mercial equipment.
 
Developing countries: Stand-alone equipment is the main 
form of commercial refrigeration in developing countries, with 
condensing units being used by larger food retailers. CFCs, 
HCFCs and HFCs are all being used, with trends towards HFCs 
HFC-134a and HFC-404A in the future.
 
In China, HCFC-22 and HFC-134a are the major refriger-
ants for commercial refrigeration, with R-404A showing rapid 
growth. Only limited amounts of CFC-12 and R-502 are in use, 
as most of the systems designed for these refrigerants have con-
verted to HFC-134a and R-404A. HCFC blends have very little 
application, as Chinese regulatory groups prefer to switch di-
rectly to HFCs instead of using any transitional HCFC blends.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
global annual emissions rate from the commercial refrigeration 
sector of 30% of the refrigerant charge (leakage and non-re-
covery) (Palandre et al., 2004). Expressed in CO2 equivalents, 
commercial refrigeration represents 40% of total annual refrig-
erant emissions, see Table 4.1. The emission levels (including 
fugitive emissions, ruptures, emissions during servicing and at 
end-of-life) are generally very high, especially for supermarkets 
and hypermarkets. The larger the charge, the larger the average 
emission rate. This is due to the due to the very long pipes, the 
large numbers of ﬁttings and valves, and the huge emissions 
when ruptures occur. 
 
In the 1980s, the reported average commercial refrigera-
tion emission rates for developed countries were in the range 
of 20−35% of refrigerant charge per year (Fischer et al., 1991; 
AEAT, 2003; Pedersen, 2003). The high emission rates were due 
to design, construction, installation and service practices being 
followed without an awareness of potential environmental im-
pact. In some countries emissions from these systems have been 
decreasing due to industry efforts and governmental regulations 
with respect to refrigerant containment, recovery and usage re-
cord keeping, increased personnel training and certiﬁcation, 
and improved service procedures, as well as increased attention 
for many system mechanical details including the reduction or 
elimination of threaded joints and a reduction in the number of 
joints in refrigerating systems. 
 
Recent annualized emission rates in the range of 3−22% (av-
erage of 18%) were reported for 1700 supermarket systems in 
several European countries and the USA. The country-speciﬁc 
data and references are listed in Table 4.8. It may be concluded 
that if the emission estimates of Palandre et al. (2003 and 2004) 
are correct, the above-reported values of 3−22% must represent 
selected company data within countries that have a strong em-
phasis on emission reductions.
 
Emission rates vary considerably between equipment cat-
egories. Annual emission rates for the several categories are 
listed in Table 4.9. Individual system leak rates, however, can 
range from zero to over 100% yr-1. It should also be noted that 
end-of-life recovery data are mostly not included, and therefore 
the annual average leakage rates may be 5−10% higher than the 
values given in the tables.
 
It is important to note that in certain cases, data collection 
should be considered in context. Some of the base data used 
in emission and emission projection studies has been collated 
from telephone interviews, and other similar techniques, from 
historical reports. This reliance on anecdotal data may suggest 
underestimated emissions, since both the end-users and refrig-
eration contractors have an interest in reporting low values be-
cause of exposure of poor practices and the threat of restrictive 
legislation. 
 
As well as measures designed to decrease emissions, there 
are also drivers – typically at ﬁeld level – that inhibit emis-
sion reduction and must be addressed at a policy level. These 
include partial success in ﬁnding system leaks, end-users em-
ploying contractors on an ‘as-the-need-arises’ basis rather than 
a preventative basis, additional attendance time for refrigerant 
recovery and leak testing, and a ﬁnancial incentive for contrac-
tors to sell more refrigerant to the end-user.
 
There have been important observations on system emission 
characteristics and how emission reductions have been accom-
plished. Some are listed below.
 
In the Netherlands, emissions have been signiﬁcantly re-
duced through national mandatory regulations established in 
1992 for CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs. These measures have been 
assisted by an industry supported certiﬁcation model (STEK, 
which is the abbreviation for the institution for certiﬁcation of 
practices for installation companies in the refrigeration busi-
ness). Elements of the regulation are detailed by Gerwen and 
Verwoerd (1998), and include the technical requirements to im-
prove tightness, system commissioning to include pressure and 
leakage tests, refrigerant record keeping, periodic system-leak 
tightness inspections, and maintenance and installation work 
by certiﬁed companies and servicing personnel (Gerwen and 
Verwoerd, 1998). The STEK organization was founded in 1991 
to promote competency in the handling of refrigerants and to 
reduce refrigerant emissions. STEK is responsible for company 
certiﬁcation, personnel certiﬁcation and the setting-up of train-

The success of the Dutch regulations and the STEK orga-
nization in reducing refrigerant emissions was demonstrated 
by the results from a detailed study in 1999 of emission data 
from the refrigeration and air conditioning sectors. For com-
mercial refrigeration, annual refrigerant emissions (emissions 
during leakage plus disposal) as low as 3.2% of the total bank of 
refrigerant contained in this sector were reported (Hoogen and 
Ree, 2002). 
 
In Germany, the report by Birndt et al. (2000) found that 
no leaks were identiﬁed in 40.3% of the systems, 14.4% of the 
leaks contributed to 85% of the refrigerant loss and 83% of 
the leaks occurred in the assembly joints. The report by Haaf 
and Heinbokel (2002) was on R-404A systems in medium- and 
low-temperature supermarket refrigeration. Data was taken on 
systems installed after 1995 with improved technologies for 
leak tightness, plus a reduction of refrigerant ﬁll quantities by 
15%. Annual leakage rates were determined to be 5% of charge, 
which represented a 10% reduction on the level reported in pre-
vious years. 
 
The data from Sweden showed annual refrigerant losses de-
creasing from 14% in 1993 to 10.4% in 2002 (Bivens and Gage, 
2004), with the lower emissions being attributed, in part, to an 
increased application of indirect cooling systems with reduced 
refrigerant charges in supermarkets. 
 
A set of 2000–2001 USA emissions data were available for 
223 supermarkets in the California South Coast Air Quality 
Management District (Los Angeles area). The data were re-
ported in system charge sizes from 23 kg up to 1285 kg. Over 
the two-year period, 77% of the smaller charge size systems 
(23−137 kg) required no refrigerant additions, 65% of the me-
dium charge size systems (138−455 kg) required no refrigerant 
additions and 44% of the larger charge size systems (456−1285 
kg) required no refrigerant additions. These are the outcomes 
expected, based on larger charge size systems having longer 
piping runs, more assembly joints, more valves and more op-
portunities for refrigerant leakage. For the 223 supermarkets, 
total averaged refrigerant emission rates were 13% of charge in 
2000, and 19% in 2001 (Bivens and Gage, 2004).
 
The data from Germany and the USA indicate that, since 
the average emission rates include systems with no emissions, 
the leaking systems have higher loss rates than the averages. 
This ampliﬁes the importance of monitoring refrigerant charge 
using sight glasses and liquid levels, and of periodic checking 
with leak detectors. These both represent a signiﬁcant oppor-
tunity for identifying and repairing high leakage rate sources. 
Procedures for emission reduction have been developed by 
ANSI/ASHRAE, 2002.
 
The trend away from the ozone-depleting CFCs and HCFCs, 
and towards an increased use of HFCs means, that despite lower 
leakage rates, HFC leakage from refrigeration is set to increase 
considerably. For example in Europe, a 50% cut in leakage rates 
due to the initiation of STEK-like programmes in every mem-
ber state would result in emissions rising from 2.5–4.3 Mtonnes 
CO2-eq  in 1995 to around 30 Mtonnes CO2-eq in 2010, in-
stead of 45 Mtonnes CO2-eq under a business-as-usual scenario 
(Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000; Enviros, 2003).
 
The continuing collection of reliable emissions data is an 
important factor in getting a clear picture of the leakage situa-
tion and thereby establishing progress in the reduction of refrig-
erant emissions. Palandre et al. (2003 and 2004) and US EPA 
(2004) report two global programmes for the collection of such 
data. Data from the Clodic and Palandre (2004) permits the cal-
culation of the worldwide commercial refrigeration emission 
rate for the year 2002 and this amounted to 30% of the com-
mercial refrigeration systems inventory. The US EPA model 
information also permits the calculation of a potential 20−30% 
reduction business-as-usual HFC emissions from commercial 
refrigeration in the year 2015, by applying abatement options 
that require a more aggressive leak detection and repair and the 
increased use of distributed and indirect systems (Bivens and 
Gage, 2004). 
4.3.4 
Non-HFC technologies (vapour compression)
A number of HCs, ammonia and CO2 systems of different re-
frigerating capacities have been installed in various European 
countries during the past 5 years. A few examples of these are 
now given. 
4.3.4.1 
Stand-alone equipment and condensing units
Some well-established beverage companies and ice cream 
manufacturers have recently stated (2000−2001) that by 2004 
they will no longer purchase new equipment that uses HFCs in 
their refrigerant systems, provided that alternative refrigerants 
or technologies become available at an acceptable cost. HCs, 
CO2 and Stirling technology are being evaluated by one of the 
companies (Coca Cola, 2002). The HFC-free strategy of the 
companies were conﬁrmed during June 2004 (RefNat, 2004).
4.3.4.1.1 Hydrocarbons
Various companies in several countries have developed vend-
ing machines and small commercial equipment using HCs. 
The equipment uses HC-600a, HC-290 and HC-based blends. 
Limitations on charge sizes are speciﬁed by safety standards 
(e.g. EN 378, IEC 60335-2-89), where maximum amounts per 
circuit are 2.5 kg, 1.5 kg and 150 g, dependent on the applica-
tion. Nevertheless, HC charges tend to be about 50% less than 
equivalent HFCs and HCFCs due to lower densities which 
minimize the impact of such limits. Recent developments with 
charge-reduction techniques (Hoehne and Hrnjak, 2004) sug-
gest that charges for future systems will become even less. 
Christensen (2004) reports on the experience with stand-alone 
equipment installed in a restaurant in Denmark. Results from a 
detailed quantitative risk assessment model that examined the 
safety of hydrocarbons in commercial refrigeration systems are 
reported in Colbourne and Suen (2004).

developing stand-alone equipment with a direct expansion CO2 
system (Christensen, 1999) and is also one of the refrigerants 
being evaluated by Coca Cola (2002). The company conﬁrmed 
their HFC-free strategy in June 2004 and announced that CO2-
based refrigeration is their current choice for future equipment 
(Coca Cola, 2004). R&D activities for CO2-based solutions 
have also been announced by another company (McDonalds, 
2004).
4.3.4.2 
Full supermarket systems
4.3.4.2.1 Direct systems
CO2 direct systems
CO2 is non-ﬂammable, non-toxic and has a GWP value of only 
1. It is therefore highly suited for use in direct refrigeration sys-
tems, as long as acceptable energy efﬁciency can be achieved 
at a reasonable cost. There are two basic types of CO2 direct 
systems using only CO2 as a refrigerant and cascade systems. 
 
Direct systems using only CO2 as a refrigerant have been 
developed with a transcritical/subcritical cycle, depending on 
ambient temperature, for both low- and medium-temperature 
refrigeration are developed. In addition to giving a totally non-
HFC solution, reduced pipe diameters due to higher pressures, 
good heat transfer characteristics of CO2 and the possibility to 
obtain energy efﬁcient heat recovery can be mentioned. Five 
medium-sized supermarkets have been installed with this con-
cept by the beginning of June 2004, in addition to some smaller 
ﬁeld test systems (Girotto and Nekså, 2002; Girotto et al. 2003; 
Girotto et al. 2004).
 
Cascade systems are being developed with CO2 at the low-
temperature stage associated with ammonia or other refriger-
ants (R-404A for example) at the medium-temperature stage. 
Several of these systems have been installed in the ﬁeld and are 
currently being evaluated in different European countries. Haaf 
and Heinbokel (2003) have described 33 such CO2 cascade sys-
tems from one manufacturer that were in service in 2003. It 
is emphasized that this technology could receive widespread 
interest because it has also been developed for the food industry 
(Rolfsmann, 1999; Christensen, 1999).
 
In addition to these two options, a third distributed system 
concept was described by Nekså et al. (1998). Self-contained 
display cabinets, each with CO2 refrigeration units, are con-
nected to a hydronic heat-recovery circuit that heats service 
water and buildings. A large temperature glide in the hydronic 
circuit, typically 50−60 K, and a correspondingly low volume 
ﬂow rate and small pipe dimensions can be achieved by using 
the transcritical CO2 process. Waste heat with a high tempera-
ture (70−75oC) is available for tap water and/or space heating. 
Excess heat is ejected to the ambient air. 
 
The Institute of Refrigeration in London has released a 
‘Safety Code for Refrigerating Systems Utilizing Carbon 
Dioxide’. This contains a lot of relevant information despite 
much of the focus being on larger capacity industrial sized sys-
tems.
4.3.4.2.2 Indirect systems
Ammonia and hydrocarbons (HCs)
The quantity of ammonia can be 10% of the usual HFC refriger-
ant charge, due to indirect system design and the thermodynam-
ic properties such as latent heat vaporization and liquid density 
(Presotto and Süffert, 2001). For HCs, the refrigerant charge 
is typically 10% of the direct system HFC reference charge 
(Baxter, 2003a,b).
 
In Northern Europe, ammonia or HCs (including HC-1270, 
HC-290 and HC-290/170 blends) have been used as refriger-
ants for the same type of indirect systems. For safety purposes, 
the refrigerant circuits are either separated in a number of inde-
pendent circuits to limit the charge of each system or a number 
of independent chiller circuits are used (Powell et al., 2000).
Heat transfer ﬂuids (HTF)
The HTFs used in indirect systems require special attention, 
especially at low temperatures where pumping power may be 
excessive. The choice of the correct HTF to obtain the desired 
energy efﬁciency is critical and a handbook on ﬂuid property 
data is available from IIR/IIF (Melinder, 1997).
CO2 as a heat transfer ﬂuid
For indirect systems, CO2 can be used as either a standard HTF 
without phase change or as a two-phase HTF that partially 
evaporates in the display case evaporators and condenses in the 
primary heat exchanger.
 
At low temperatures, phase-changing CO2 HTF shows 
promising results. Due to the viscosity constraint of other al-
ternatives at low temperatures and the good heat transfer prop-
erties of CO2, the use of CO2 as a low-temperature HTF has 
received more consideration than the alternatives. When CO2 
is used with phase change, the diameter of the tubes can be 
signiﬁcantly reduced, and the heat transfer in the display case 
heat-exchanger is far more effective. If the temperature can be 
maintained below –12°C, traditional technologies in which the 
tubes and heat exchanger are designed for a maximum operat-
ing pressure of 25 bar, are possible. About 50 such systems are 
in operation in Europe. Expansion vessels, cold ﬁnger concepts 
or simply using the cold stored in the goods, are possible alter-
natives for keeping the pressures within acceptable limits.
Ice slurry as a heat transfer ﬂuid
An interesting new technology for medium temperature, which 
offers the possibility of energy storage and high-energy efﬁcien-
cy, is indirect systems that use ice slurry as the HTF. Research 
has been carried out in some pilot installations. A handbook 
is currently being developed by the International Institute of 
Refrigeration and several recent papers on various aspects of 
the technology are described in Egolf and Kauffeld (2005).

4.3.5 
Not in-kind technologies (non-vapour 
compression)
There are very few examples of the successful implementation 
of ‘not-in-kind’ technologies in this sector. One possible ex-
ample is the Stirling cycle. For low capacity, high-temperature 
lift applications in particular (>60 K), the Stirling cycle may 
reach competitive COP values. Although Stirling systems have 
been developed, cost is still an issue (Lundqvist 1993; Kagawa, 
2000). This technology is also being evaluated for display cabi-
nets (Coca Cola, 2002). Another interesting recent technology 
is thermoacoustic refrigeration (Poese, 2004).
 
Heat-driven cycles have not found their way into commer-
cial refrigeration. The use of heat-driven cycles such as absorp-
tion and adsorption in supermarkets have been discussed in 
literature (Maidment and Tozer, 2002). Some attempts with so-
lar-driven refrigeration for fresh food handling have also been 
developed and tested (Pridasawas and Lundqvist, 2003). The 
use of sorption technologies for dehumidiﬁcation, thus lower-
ing the cooling load on display cabinets, is an interesting op-
tion.
4.3.6 
Relevant practices to reduce refrigerant emissions
As stated at the beginning of this section, several abatement 
strategies can be used to reduce refrigerant greenhouse gas 
emissions. New design ideas have been mentioned throughout 
the chapter and these may be summarized as a general trend 
towards lower refrigerant charge, using direct or indirect sys-
tems, and the use of non-HFC refrigerants such as ammonia, 
CO2 or HCs. These options should be considered on the basis of 
a balanced evaluation of refrigerant emission reductions, initial 
investment costs, safety, operating costs and energy consump-
tion.
 
The European Commission has proposed a new regulation 
to reduce the emissions of ﬂuorinated greenhouse gases, includ-
ing HFCs from refrigeration equipment. In addition to a gen-
eral obligation to avoid leakage, installations with over 3 kg of 
charge will require at least annual inspections, and a refrigerant 
detector will be required for systems over 300 kg. Reports will 
also be required for the import and export of refrigerants, and 
end-of-life recovery, recycling or destruction of the refriger-
ant. Additional information on country initiatives for refriger-
ant conservation is described in the 2002 UNEP TOC report, 
Sections 4.7 and 10.1 to 10.9 (UNEP, 2003).
 
Several programmes, for example in the Netherlands and 
Sweden, have shown good results with respect to leakage miti-
gation for existing plants. A common denominator has been a 
combination of regulation, education and accreditation of ser-
vice personnel (STEK, 2001). In Denmark and Norway a tax 
on refrigerants in proportion to their GWP value has proven 
successful in curbing emissions and promoting systems that use 
non-HFC refrigerants.
 
A reduction of the refrigeration capacity demand, for ex-
ample by using better insulation and closed rather than open 
cabinets, might indirectly reduce refrigerant emissions, but also 
the power consumption of a supermarket. Design integration 
with air-conditioning and heating systems are also important 
measures in this respect.
An interesting development in new design tools for supermar-
kets, opens up new possibilities for improving the design of 
systems using an LCC perspective, which favours more energy 
efﬁcient systems with lower operating costs (Baxter, 2003a,b).
4.3.7 
Comparison of HFC and non-HFC technologies
The current rapid developments in the subsector are moving 
the targets for energy efﬁciency, charge reduction and cost. 
This makes a comparison between technologies difﬁcult. 
Furthermore, the relatively complex links between energy ef-
ﬁciency, emissions and the costs of systems and their mainte-
nance means that it sis difﬁcult to make fair comparisons. 
4.3.7.1 
Energy consumption of supermarkets
Depending on the size of the supermarket, the refrigeration 
equipment energy consumption represents between 35−50% of 
the total energy consumption of the store (Lundqvist, 2000). 
This ratio depends on a number of factors such as lighting, air 
conditioning, and so forth. For typical smaller supermarkets 
of around 2000 m2, refrigeration represents between 40−50% 
of the total energy consumption and for even smaller stores it 
could be up to 65%. 
 
New, high-efﬁciency commercial supermarkets have been 
designed in some European countries and the USA by using a 
number of efﬁcient technologies. These references can be seen 
as prototypes and one example from UK presents energy con-
sumption ﬁgures which are a factor of two lower compared to 
usual stores (Baxter, 2003a,b). Most examples however show 
reductions of between 10−20%. 
 
The high annual growth rate of stand-alone equipment, 
which tends to be less energy efﬁcient per kW cooling power 
than centralized systems, should be addressed. Integrating heat 
rejection from the individual cabinets in a water circuit may 
be one way of obtaining improved energy efﬁciency. Excessive 
heat rejection within the store might also lead to an increased 
demand for air conditioning, further increasing the energy de-
mand. 
4.3.7.2 
Energy efﬁciency of direct systems
The energy efﬁciency of refrigeration systems ﬁrst of all de-
pends on the temperature levels for which refrigeration is pro-
vided and on the global design of the system. Measurements 
of system efﬁciency can be found in the literature, for example 
in UNEP (2003). However, comparisons of different systems 
are often difﬁcult because the boundary conditions are rarely 
comparable. 
 
Potential energy-saving measures may be divided into four 
different groups: advanced system solutions, utilization of nat-
ural cold (free cooling), energy-efﬁcient equipment (display

cases, efﬁcient illumination, night curtains, etc.) and indoor cli-
mate/building-related measures. Energy-efﬁcient illumination 
has the double effect of reducing loads on display cases as well 
as direct electric consumption. Heat recovery from condensers 
is sometimes preferred in cold climates but internal heat gen-
eration from plug-in units and illumination is often enough to 
heat the premises (Lundqvist, 2000).
 
The refrigeration system efﬁciency also depends on a num-
ber of parameters: pressure losses related to the circuit length, 
system control and the seasonal variation of the outside temper-
ature. For a number of global companies energy consumption, 
and with this the energy efﬁciency of refrigerating systems, has 
become an important issue, especially in countries where elec-
tricity prices are high. One approach to energy savings is to 
utilize ‘ﬂoating condensing temperature’ in which the condens-
ing temperature follows ambient temperature. The issue of cli-
mate change and the desire to reduce GHG emissions has also 
heightened the interest in increasing the energy efﬁciency.
4.3.7.3 
Energy efﬁciency and cost of indirect systems
The evaluation of the additional energy consumption related to 
indirect systems is an ongoing process. Direct ﬁeld comparisons 
between direct and indirect systems are difﬁcult (Lundqvist, 
2000; Baxter, 2003a). Moreover, the main driver for centralized 
systems is initial cost. Due to the design of heat exchangers in 
display cases (especially medium-temperature, open-type) the 
performances of some indirect systems can be equal or even 
slightly better than direct systems (Baxter, 2003a). For low tem-
peratures, the energy penalty can be substantial depending on 
the design. 
 
On the other hand, the relative energy consumption of in-
direct systems − compared to conventional direct expansion 
systems − can show an increased energy consumption of up 
to 15%. Conclusions can only be drawn if reference lines for 
the energy consumption of centralized systems are plotted in 
which the origin of energy inefﬁciencies are apparent. Due to 
the extra temperature difference required, inherently indirect 
systems should give higher energy consumptions compared to 
direct systems. Recent practical experiences and experimental 
studies (Mao et al., 1998; Mao and Hrnjak, 1999; Lindborg, 
2000; Baxter, 2003a,b), however, indicate that well-designed 
indirect systems may have energy efﬁciencies approaching 
those of good direct systems. Further research is clearly needed 
to clarify the reasons for this. More efﬁcient defrost, better part-
load characteristics, better expansion device performance and 
more reliable systems are believed to contribute to indirect sys-
tem energy efﬁciency. The costs might be 10−30% higher, but 
these can potentially be reduced (Yang, 2001; Christensen and 
Bertilsen, 2003).
4.3.7.4 
Energy efﬁciency and cost of ammonia systems
There are several indirect systems in operation that are suc-
cessfully using ammonia as the primary refrigerant (Haaf and 
Heinbokel, 2002). As ammonia is toxic and may create panic 
due to the strong smell at low concentrations appropriate safety 
precautions are required. Excellent energy efﬁciency can be 
achieved with properly-designed systems. The drawbacks for 
ammonia systems are limited service competence (Lindborg, 
2002) and higher initial costs,  typically 20−30%. A life-cycle 
cost evaluation is therefore required. 
4.3.7.5 
Energy efﬁciency and cost of hydrocarbon systems
Full supermarket systems using hydrocarbons in an indirect 
design have been installed in several European countries. A 
dedicated ventilation system (if installed in a machine room), 
gas detectors, gas-tight electric equipment and so forth have 
been installed for safety reasons. The use of hydrocarbons has 
increased the R&D effort to signiﬁcantly minimize refrigerant 
charge. A small prototype system of approximately 4 kW cool-
ing capacity using 150 g of HC-290 and micro-channel heat 
exchanger technology has been demonstrated by Fernando et. 
al. (2003). Cost is still an issue, typically up to 30% higher, but 
further development is expected to reduce costs. HC-290 and 
HC-1270 are excellent refrigerants from a thermodynamic point 
of view and equipment design is relatively straightforward. The 
availability of some standard components is still limited, but to 
a certain extent the hydrocarbon systems can use the same type 
of system components as HFC systems. Cascade systems with 
HC-290 and CO2 for full supermarket systems were reported to 
have an energy efﬁciency equal to conventional direct system 
design (Baxter, 2003a,b).
 
For stand-alone equipment and condensing units, several 
references report a higher efﬁciency of HC refrigerants sys-
tems compared to equivalent systems with HFCs, for example 
Elefsen et al. (2002). Others claim that higher efﬁciency can 
be achieved with HFC systems, if the extra costs used for the 
safety precautions of HC systems are used to improve system 
efﬁciency of the HFC system (Hwang et al., 2004). 
 
4.3.7.6 
Energy efﬁciency and cost of CO2 systems
Centralized CO2 direct systems for both medium and low tem-
perature, operating in either  transcritical or subcritical cycle 
dependent on the ambient temperature, are reported to require 
about 10% higher energy consumption than a state-of-the-art 
R-404A direct system (Girotto et al., 2003 and 2004). Several 
measures for improvements have however been identiﬁed. The 
cost is reported to be about 10−20% higher than for direct ex-
pansion R-404A systems and this difference is mainly due to 
components produced in small series.
 
Haaf and Heinbokel (2003), report energy consumption 
and investment costs for R-404A/CO2 cascade systems that are 
similar to R-404A direct systems. This is due to the fact that 
components for CO2 cascade systems are more similar to R-
404A components (maximum pressure 40 bar), allowing more 
standard components to be used. Girotto et al. (2004) report 
higher costs for cascade systems (see also comment about HC-
290/CO2 above).

4.3.7.7 
Energy efﬁciency and cost of HFC systems with 
reduced emissions
Ongoing R&D efforts to minimize refrigerant charge without 
compromizing energy efﬁciency are applicable to HFC refriger-
ants as well. The standard approach to charge minimization is to 
use no receiver or hermetic compressors and to keep piping as 
short as possible. Tight systems require brazed joints and these 
are most reliably made when systems are factory assembled. 
The potential for charge reduction is illustrated by Fernando 
et al. (2003). They present HC systems using as little as 150 g 
refrigerant for a 5 kW domestic heat pump. The density of HFC 
refrigerant is approximately twice that of HC and therefore a 
comparable system using 300 g of HFC refrigerant is within 
reach, if further heat exchanger development is undertaken. 
More complex cycles are another way of improving systems. 
Beeton and Pham (2003), report a 41% capacity increase and a

4.3.8 
Comparison of LCCP and mitigation costs
The number of publications that give TEWI or LCCP data for 
commercial refrigeration systems is limited but is growing 
rapidly. Harnisch et. al. (2003) calculated the LCCP for sev-
eral different types of full supermarket refrigeration systems in 
Germany. They used a straightforward model which took pro-
duction, emissions and energy usage into account. CO2 emis-
sions from power production were calculated using an average 
emission factor of 0.58 kg CO2 kWh-1. The transparent method 
to evaluate the various systems allows sensitivity analyses to be 
performed using other literature references referred to in this 
report. Table 4.10 presents characteristic ﬁgures from Harnisch 
et. al. (2003) and compares these to calculated results based on 
representative data from other literature references. 
 
The data used for the table are selected as follows: The 30% 
emission is based on Palandre et al., 2004 and the 11.5% and 
6.5% emission scenarios are based on Harnisch et al. (2003), 
Bivens and Gage (2004) Baxter (2003a) and ADL (2002). The 
11.5% and 6.5% emissions represent 10% and 5% emissions 
yr-1, with a 15% end-of-life recovery loss apportioned over a 10-
year lifetime. Energy consumption ﬁgures are extracted from 
Harnisch et al. (2003), Haaf and Heinbokel (2002), Girotto et 
al. (2003) and Baxter (2003b). It is clear that several different 
alternatives result in reductions in CO2 equivalent emissions of 
the same order of magnitude. The same applies for an HFC al-
ternative, if the annual emission rate can be as low as 5%. If a 
5% leakage is possible, the dominating contribution from most 
systems is an indirect effect due to power production. 
 
Supermarket system and mitigation cost estimates are 
scarce. Harnich et al. (2003) give data for German supermar-
kets with costs ranging from 20−280 US$ per tCO2–eq miti-
gated. The lowest values are given for a system using direct 
expansion CO2 for low temperature and direct expansion with 
R-404A for high temperature. Mitigation costs are estimated 
using a 10% leakage rate and a 1.5 % recovery loss, with a 10-
year lifetime and a discount rate of 10% to reﬂect commercial 
decision-making. An average cost of 100 US$ m-2 of supermar-
ket area is used as a baseline for cost estimates. This ﬁgure is 
conﬁrmed by Sherwood (1999) who reports on cost ﬁgures for 
a 3200 m2 supermarket in the USA. 
 
Using this data with a broader range of leakage rates and 
estimated costs, signiﬁcantly reduces the typical mitigation 
costs per tonne of CO2 suggested by Harnisch et al. (2003) but 
also expands the total range to values of 10−300 US$ per tonne 
CO2-eq mitigated. 
 
Additional mitigation costs for the various systems sug-
gested in the chapter have not been calculated. Cost estimates 
for various technologies given in the literature suggest a cost in-
crease between 0 and 30% for alterative technologies compared 
to a baseline, full supermarket, direct system using R-404A as 
refrigerant. Some detailed ﬁgures are already given under each 
section and a general summary is given for each technology in 
Table 4.11.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
In this report energy efﬁciency has been treated as relative 
changes in energy usage for several recent types of systems, 
the main purpose of which is to mitigate emissions, see also 
Table 4.11. However, the systems investigated are based on 
current technological standards for components such as heat 
exchangers, compressors and so forth. No attempts have been 
made to predict the future energy-saving potential in commer-
cial refrigeration applications if future possible improvements 
are achieved. Several possibilities for reducing the energy con-
sumption of refrigeration systems exists, but in principle most 
of these may be applied irrespective of the refrigerant used in 
the system. These options may also lead to negative mitigation 
costs, as for instance reported in Godwin (2004) and March 
(1998).
 
The authors ﬁrmly believe that the ongoing technical de-
velopment of components and systems together with various 
energy-saving measures (such as heat recovery, more efﬁcient 
compressors and display cases, larger heat exchangers, ﬂoat-

Food processing and cold storage
4.4.1 
Introduction
Food processing and cold storage is one of the important appli-
cations of refrigeration, and is aimed at preserving and distrib-
uting food whilst keeping its nutrients intact. This application 
of refrigeration is very signiﬁcant in terms of size and economic 
importance, and this also applies to developing countries. Food 
processing includes many subsectors such as dairy products, 
ice cream, meat processing, poultry processing, ﬁsh processing, 
abattoirs, fruit & vegetable processing, coffee, cocoa, choco-
late & sugar confectionery, grain, bread & ﬂour confectionery 
& biscuits, vegetable, animal oils & fats, miscellaneous foods, 
breweries and soft drinks (March, 1996).
 
The annual global consumption of frozen foods is about 30 
Mtonnes yr-1. Over the past decade, consumption has increased 
by 50% and it is still growing. The USA accounts for more than 
half of the consumption, with more than 63 kg per capita. The 
average ﬁgure for the European Union (EU) is 25 kg and for 
Japan 16 kg. The amount of chilled food is about 10−12 times 
greater than the supply of frozen products, giving a total vol-
ume of refrigerated food of around 350 Mtonnes yr-1 (1995) 
with an estimated annual growth of 5% (IIR, 1996; UNEP, 
2003). Like chilling and freezing, food processing is also of 
growing importance in developing countries. This is partly due 
to the treatment of high-value food products for export. Even 
in 1984, about half of the ﬁsh landed in developing countries 
(more than 15 Mtonnes) was refrigerated at certain stages of 
processing, storage or transport (UNEP, 1998). The estimated 
annual growth rate in food processing between 1996 and 2002 
was 4% in developed countries and 7% in developing countries 
(UNEP, 2003).
 
Frozen food in long term-storage is generally kept at −15oC 
to −30oC, while −30oC to −35 oC is typical for the freezing pro-
cess. In so-called ‘super-freezers’, the product is kept at −50oC. 
Chilled products are cooled and stored at temperatures from 
−1oC to 10oC.
 
The majority of refrigerating systems for food processing 
and cold storage are based on reciprocating and screw com-
pressors. System size may vary from cold stores of 3 kW cool-
ing demand to large processing plants requiring several MW of 
cooling. Reciprocating compressors are most frequently used in 
the lower capacity range, whereas screw compressors are com-
mon in larger systems (UNEP, 2003). 
4.4.2 
Technical options
Most of the refrigerating systems used for food processing and 
cold storage are based on vapour compression systems of the 
direct type, with the refrigerant distributed to heat exchangers 
in the space or apparatus to be refrigerated. Such systems are 
generally custom-made and erected on site. Indirect systems 
with liquid chiller or ice banks are also commonly used in the 
food processing industry for fruit and vegetable packing, meat 
processing and so forth. Ammonia, HCFC-22, R-502 and CFC-
12 are the refrigerants historically used. The current technical 
options are HFCs, and non-ﬂuorocarbons refrigerants such as 
ammonia, CO2 and hydrocarbons (UNEP, 2003). Table 4.12 
gives the main refrigerant technical options along with percent-
age annual emissions for food processing, cold storage and in-
dustrial refrigeration applications (Clodic and Palandre, 2004). 
4.4.3 
HFC technologies
HFC refrigerants are being replaced by place of CFC-12, R-502 
and HCFC-22 in certain regions. The preferred HFCs for food 
processing and cold storage applications are HFC-134a, HFC 
blends with insigniﬁcant temperature glide such as R-404A, 
R-410A and azeotropic blends like R-507A. The HFC blend 
R-407C is also ﬁnding application as a replacement for HCFC-
22.
 
HFC-134a has completely replaced CFC-12 in various ap-
plications of refrigeration. However, CFC-12 was not widely 
used in food processing and cold storage because it requires 
considerably greater compressor swept volume than HCFC-22 
or ammonia to produce the same refrigerating effect. There is 
limited use of HFC-134a in this subsector.
 
R-404A, R-407C and R-507A are currently the most used 
HFCs for cold storage and food processing. These blends are 
preferred to HFC-134a due to the higher volumetric capacity 
Table 4.12. Food processing, cold storage and industrial refrigeration (2002).

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
and lower system cost (UNEP, 1998). In spite of minor tempera-
ture glides, R-404A has proven to be applicable even in ﬂooded 
systems (Barreau et al., 1996). R-404A and R-507A are the pri-
mary replacements for R-502. The coefﬁcients of performance 
are comparable to R-502 but signiﬁcantly lower compared to 
those of NH3 and HCFC-22, especially at high condensing tem-
peratures. Air-cooled condensers should be avoided as far as 
possible. The liquid should be subcooled to achieve optimal ef-
ﬁciencies and high cost-effectiveness for systems with R-404A 
and R-507A. In chill applications it may also be necessary to 
add signiﬁcant superheat to the suction gas in order to avoid 
refrigerant condensation in the oil separator (UNEP, 2003).
 
R-410A is also one of the HFC blends which is expected 
to gain a market share in food processing and cold storage ap-
plications due to the lower compressor swept volume require-
ments in comparison to other refrigerants (except to CO2). The 
compressor efﬁciencies, pressure drop in suction lines and 
heat transfer efﬁciency will beneﬁt from high system pressure 
(UNEP, 1998). Due to the high volumetric capacity (40% above 
that of HCFC-22), R-410A compressor efﬁciency has been re-
ported to be higher than with HCFC-22 (Meurer and König, 
1999). R-410A can have system energy efﬁciency similar to 
that of ammonia and HCFC-22 and signiﬁcantly higher than 
that of R-404A and R-507A for evaporation temperatures down 
to –40°C. 
4.4.4 
Non-HFC technologies
Ammonia
Ammonia is one of the leading refrigerants for food processing 
and cold storage applications. The current market share in sev-
eral European countries, especially in the north, is estimated to 
be up to 80% (UNEP, 1998). In the USA ammonia has approxi-
mately 90% market share in systems of 100 kW cooling capac-
ity and above in custom-engineered process use (IIR, 1996). 
 
Recently designed ammonia-based systems have improved 
quality with respect to design, use of low-temperature mate-
rials and better welding procedures. Low charge is another 
positive development. However, more important is that these 
factory made units or systems represent a new level of quality 
improvement. These systems are not likely to break or release 
their charge in another way unless there is a human error or 
direct physical damage. Charge reduction has been achieved by 
using plate-type heat exchangers or direct expansion tube and 
shell evaporators (UNEP, 2003).
HCFC-22
The use of HCFC-22 is declining in food processing and cold 
storage applications in most developed countries. In Europe 
some of the end-users prefer ammonia and CO2 wherever pos-
sible, whereas HCFC-22 has become the most common refrig-
erant to replace CFCs in food processing and cold storage in the 
USA (UNEP, 2003).
 
In developing countries, HCFC-22 is still an important 
replacement refrigerant for CFCs in new systems, as from a 
technical point of view HCFC-22 could replace CFC-12 and 
CFC-502 in new systems. Another important consideration in 
developing countries is that HCFC-22 will be available for ser-
vice for the full system lifetime. 
Hydrocarbons (HCs)
A growing market for low charge hydrocarbon systems has been 
observed in some European countries. So far market shares are 
small, which may be due to the ﬂammability of these refrig-
erants. Nevertheless, several manufacturers have developed a 
wide range of products.
 
Commercialized refrigerants used in food processing and 
cold storage applications include HC-290, HC-1270 and HC-
290/600a blends, although pure substances will be preferred in 
ﬂooded systems. All of these refrigerants possess vapour pres-
sures very similar to those of HCFC-22 and R-502. System 
performance with regard to system efﬁciency is comparable to, 
and in some cases even superior to, that of the halocarbons. 
Hydrocarbons are soluble with all lubricants, and compatible 
with materials such as metals and elastomers that are tradition-
ally used in refrigeration equipment. As long as safety aspects 
are duly considered, standard refrigeration practice for HCFCs 
and CFCs can be used without major system detriment to sys-
tem integrity (UNEP, 1998, 2003).
 
Given the ﬂammability concerns, design considerations as 
detailed in the relevant safety standards should be adhered to. 
Additional safety measures should be considered for repairing 
and servicing. Several national and European standards permit 
the use of HCs in industrial applications and lay down speciﬁc 
safety requirements (ACRIB, 2001; UNEP, 2003). 
Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide technology for low temperatures such as food 
freezing is an attractive alternative, especially in cascade sys-
tems with CO2 in lower stage and ammonia in the upper stage, 
due to its excellent thermophysical properties along with zero 
ODP and negligible GWP. 
 
Further, the volumetric refrigerating capacity of CO2 is ﬁve 
times higher than HFC-410A and eight times higher than for 
ammonia and other refrigerants. This means that the size of 
most of the components in the system can be reduced (Roth and 
König, 2001). However, application of CO2 places a limitation 
on evaporating temperatures due to the triple point (the tem-
perature and pressure at which liquid, solid and gaseous CO2 
are in equilibrium) of –56.6oC at 0.52 MPa. 
 
CO2 technology has been applied to food processing and 
cold storage, both as a conventional and as secondary refriger-
ant. It is expected that CO2 market share will increase in this 
subsector, especially for freezing and frozen food storage. 
Not-in-kind technologies
There are some not-in-kind (non-vapour compression) tech-
nologies like air cycle, vapour absorption technology and com-
pression-absorption technology which can be used for food 
processing and cold storage applications. Vapour absorption

technology is well-established whereas compression-absorp-
tion technology is still under development.
Vapour absorption technology
Vapour absorption is a tried and tested technology. Absorption 
technologies are a viable alternative to vapour compression 
technology wherever low cost residual thermal energy is avail-
able. The most commonly used working ﬂuid in food process-
ing and cold storage applications is ammonia with water as the 
absorbent. The use of absorption technology is often limited to 
sites that can utilize waste heat, such as co-generation systems. 
Compression-absorption technology 
Compression-absorption technology has been developed by 
combining features of the vapour-compression and vapour-ab-
sorption cycles. About 20 compression-absorption systems on 
both a laboratory and full-scale have been developed and tested 
successfully so far. Various analytical and experimental studies 
have shown that the COP of compression-absorption systems is 
comparable to that of vapour compression systems. However, 
this system suffers from the inherent disadvantage of being cap-
ital intensive in nature. The technology is still at developmental 
stage (Pratihar et al., 2001, Ferreira and Zaytsev, 2002).
4.4.5 
Factors affecting emission reduction
Design aspects
The refrigeration system design plays a vital role in minimiz-
ing the refrigerant emissions. A proper system design includ-
ing heat exchangers, evaporators and condensers can minimize 
the charge quantity and hence reduce the potential amount of 
emissions. Every effort should be made to design tight systems, 
which will not leak during the system’s lifespan. The poten-
tial for leakage is ﬁrst affected by the design of the system; 
therefore designs must also minimize the service requirements 
that lead to opening the system. Further, a good design and the 
proper manufacturing of a refrigerating system determine the 
containment of the refrigerant over the equipment’s intended 
life. The use of leak tight valves is recommended to permit the 
removal of replaceable components from the cooling system. 
The design must also provide for future recovery, for instance 
by locating valves at the low point of the installation and at each 
vessel for efﬁcient liquid refrigerant recovery (UNEP, 2003). 
Minimizing charge
The goal of minimal refrigerant charge is common for all sys-
tems due to system and refrigerant costs. Normally the designer 
calculates the amount of charge. In large systems such as food 
processing and cold stores, very little attention was generally 
given to determining the full quantity of refrigerant charge for 
the equipment. Its quantity is not often known (except for small 
factory built units). Charging the refrigerant into the system is 
done on site to ensure stable running conditions. 
 
Improved servicing practices
Servicing practices in refrigeration systems must be improved 
in order to reduce emissions. Topping-off cooling systems with 
refrigerants is a very common practice, especially for the large 
systems normally used in food processing and cold storage in-
dustry, which causes greater emissions of refrigerant. However 
in general, proper servicing has proven to be more expensive 
than topping-off refrigeration systems. It is therefore necessary 
to make end-users understand that their practice of topping-off 
the systems without ﬁxing leaks must cease because of the in-
creased emissions to the environment. The good service prac-
tices are preventive maintenance, tightness control and recov-
ery during service and at disposal. 
Installation
After proper designing of the system, installation is the main 
factor that leads to proper operation and containment during 
the useful life of the equipment. Tight joints and proper piping 
materials are required for this purpose. Proper cleaning of joints 
and evacuation to remove air and non-condensable gases will 
minimize the service requirements later on and results in re-
duced emissions. Careful system performance monitoring and 
leak checks should also be carried out  during the ﬁrst days 
of operation and on an ongoing basis. The initial checks also 
give the installer the opportunity to ﬁnd manufacturing defects 
before the system becomes fully operational. The proper instal-
lation is critical for maximum containment over the life of the 
equipment (UNEP, 2003). The refrigeration system should be 
designed and erected according to refrigeration standards (e.g. 
EN378 (CEN, 2000/2001)) and current codes of good practice.
Recovery and recycling 
The recovery and recycling of refrigerants is another important 
process that results in signiﬁcant reductions in emissions. The 
purpose of recovery is to remove as much refrigerant as pos-
sible from a system in the shortest possible amount of time. For 
applications where maintenance operations require opening the 
circuit, the difference between deep recovery and ‘normal re-
covery’ can represent 3−5% of the initial charge (Clodic, 1997). 
However many countries have adopted ﬁnal recovery vacuum 
requirements of 0.3 or 0.6 atm absolute depending on the size 
of the cooling system and saturation pressure of the refriger-
ant. This provides a recovery rate of 92−97% of the refrigerant 
(UNEP, 1998).
 
The recovered ﬂuorocarbon refrigerants can be recycled and 
then reused. The process of recycling is expected to remove oil, 
acid, particulate, moisture and non-condensable contaminants 
from the used refrigerant. The quality of recycled refrigerant 
can be measured on contaminated refrigerant samples accord-
ing to standardized test methods (ARI 700). However, recycling 
is not common practice in the case of large food processing and 
cold storage units, where the preference is to recover and re-use 
the refrigerant.

 Trends in consumption
The lifetime emissions of a refrigerant are dependent on the 
installation losses, leakage rate during operation, irregular 
events such as tube break and servicing losses including recov-
ery loss and end-of-life loss during reinstallation/reconstruc-
tion. In some European countries, HCFC systems with more 
than 10 kg charge (including all application areas) showed an 
annual emission rate of 15% of the charge in the early 1990s 
(Naturvardsverket, 1996). This ﬁgure dropped to 9% in 1995 
(UNEP 1998). Emissions from HFC systems are reported to be 
less than this, and this is probably due to more leak-proof de-
signs. On a global scale, current CFC and HCFC annual emis-
sion rates are likely to be in the range of 10−12% of the charge 
(UNEP, 1998). A recent study (Clodic and Palandre, 2004) has 
provided estimates of emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs and 
ammonia from the combined sector of Food Processing, Cold 
Storage, and Industrial Refrigeration. Table 4.12 gives the per-
centage annual emissions of these refrigerants.
 
The consumption and banks of HFCs and other ﬂuorocar-
bons have been estimated for the industrial refrigeration sector 
as a whole. Both a top-down (UNEP, 2003) and a bottom-up ap-
proach (Clodic and Palandre, 2004) are presented here (Table 
4.13). The data for 2002 and the 2015 business-as-usual projec-
tions of Clodic and Palandre (2004) are used as a basis for the 
refrigeration subsectors in this report, so as to ensure consistency 
with other refrigeration and air conditioning subsectors (see Table 
4.1). However, Table 4.13 clearly illustrates the differences be-
tween both approaches, which are clearly signiﬁcant for CFCs. 
 
Food processing and cold storage are assumed to account 
for 75% of the combined emissions and industrial refrigeration 
for the remaining 25% (UNEP, 2003).
 
The business-as-usual projections for 2015 show a signiﬁ-
cant increase in HFC consumption.
4.4.7 
Comparison of HFC and non-HFC technologies 
Energy efﬁciency and performance
As stated above R-404A and R-507A are the proven replace-
ments for R-502 and this also includes the application in ﬂooded 
evaporators used for food processing and cold storage systems. 
The cycle efﬁciencies are comparable to R-502 but signiﬁcantly 
lower compared to those of ammonia (non-HFC technology) 
especially at high condensing temperatures (UNEP, 2003). 
R-410A is another important HFC refrigerant in this sector. The 
energy efﬁciency of R-410A systems can be similar to ammo-
nia for evaporation temperatures down to −40 oC, depending 
on compressor efﬁciency and condensing temperature. The ef-
ﬁciency below −40 oC until its normal boiling point of −51.6 oC 
is slightly higher for R-410A than that of ammonia and other 
refrigerants. The compressor efﬁciencies are also reported to 
be higher compared to HCFC-22, due to the high volumetric 
capacity (40% above that of HCFC-22) of R-410A (Meurer and 
König, 1999). 
 
CO2 technology is another non-HFC technology which is 
gaining momentum. CO2 as a refrigerant is being used in food 
processing and cold storage units in cascade systems with am-
monia in higher cascade. It has been reported that the volumet-
ric refrigerating capacity of CO2 is ﬁve times higher than HFC 
410A and eight times higher than that of ammonia and other 
refrigerants. Therefore the size of most components in the sys-
tem can be reduced (Roth and König, 2001). The efﬁciency of 
CO2/ammonia cascade system in the temperature range of –40 
oC to –55oC is comparable to a two-stage system with R-410A. 
CO2 also shows a strong cost beneﬁt in large systems (Axima, 
2002). 
Life cycle climate performance LCCP 
Very limited data are available for TEWI/LCCP for this refrig-
eration sector. A recent publication (Hwang et al., 2004) reports 
a comprehensive experimental study of system performance 
and LCCP for an 11 kW refrigeration system operating with 
R-404A, R-410A and propane (HC-290) at evaporator tempera-
tures of −20°C to 0°C. For a comparison on an equal ﬁrst cost 
basis, the increased cost of safety features for HC-290 was used 
for a larger condenser for the HFC systems. The LCCP of the R-
410A system was 4% lower and the LCCP of R-404A was 2% 
higher than that of the HC-290 system at an annual refrigerant 
emission rate of 2%. The LCCP values for R-410A and HC-290 
were equal at an annual refrigerant emission rate of 5%.

Introduction
One characteristic of industrial refrigeration is the tempera-
ture range it embraces. While evaporating temperatures may 
be as high as 15°C, the range extends down to about –70°C.

Chapter 4: Refrigeration
251
At temperatures much lower than about –70°C the so-called 
‘cryogenics’ technology comes into play. This produces and 
uses liqueﬁed natural gas, liquid nitrogen, liquid oxygen and 
other low-temperature substances. Industrial refrigeration in 
this section covers refrigeration in chemical plants (separation 
of gases, solidiﬁcation of substances, removal of reaction heat, 
humidity control of chemicals), process technology (industrial 
process air conditioning, refrigeration in manufacturing plants, 
refrigeration in construction), ice rinks and winter sports facili-
ties, and laboratories where special conditions such as low tem-
peratures, must be maintained. Some deﬁnitions of industrial 
refrigeration include food processing and cold storage; these 
are described in Section 4.4 of this chapter. 
 
Industrial systems are generally custom-made and erected on 
site. A detailed description of industrial refrigeration and cold 
storage systems can be found in the ‘Industrial Refrigeration 
Handbook’ (Stoecker, 1998). Industrial refrigeration often con-
sists of systems for special and/or large refrigerating purposes. 
The cooling/heating capacity of such units vary from 25 kW to 
30 MW or even higher. These refrigeration systems are based 
on reciprocating, screw and centrifugal compressors, depend-
ing on the capacity and application. 
 
Industrial refrigeration has mainly operated with two refrig-
erants: ammonia (60−70%) and HCFC-22 (15−20%). To a lesser 
extent CFC-502 (5−7%) has been used and other minor refrig-
erants complete the rest of industrial applications. Replacement 
refrigerants for CFCs and HCFCs, plus other non-ﬂuorocarbon 
ﬂuids are included in Table 4.14.
  
The refrigerants used are preferably single compound or 
azeotropic mixture refrigerants, as most of the systems con-
cerned use ﬂooded evaporators to achieve high thermodynamic 
efﬁciencies. Industrial refrigeration systems are normally lo-
cated in industrial areas with very limited public access. For 
this reason ammonia  is commonly used in many applications 
where the hazards of toxicity and ﬂammability are clearly evi-
dent, well-deﬁned, well understood and easily handled by com-
petent personnel. Hydrocarbons may be used as an alternative 
to ammonia within sectors handling ﬂammable ﬂuids, such as 
chemical processing. 
 
There are clear differences in how countries have developed 
the technology for industrial refrigeration since the starting of 
the CFC phase-out. In Europe, the use of HCFC-22 and HCFC-
22 blends in new systems has been forbidden for all types of re-
frigerating equipment by European regulation 2037/00 (Ofﬁcial 
Journal, 2000) since 1 January 2001. The use of CFCs is also 
forbidden, that is no additional CFC shall be added for servic-
ing. HFCs are occasionally used where ammonia or hydrocar-
bons are not acceptable, although they are not often preferred 
in Europe, as European users are expecting regulations limiting 
the use of GHGs in stationary refrigeration (see proposals in 
EU, 2004). 
4.5.2 
Technical options
Most of the industrial refrigerating systems use the vapour com-
pression cycle. The refrigerant is often distributed with pumps 
to heat exchangers in the space or apparatus to be refrigerated. 
Indirect systems with heat transfer ﬂuids are used to reduce the 
risk of direct contact with the refrigerant. Ammonia  is the main 
refrigerant in this sector. HCFC-22, R-502 and CFC-12 are 
the historically used refrigerants from the group of CFCs and 
HCFCs. Beside the increasing share of ammonia for new sys-
tems, the current technical options to replace CFCs are HFCs, 
HCFC-22 and non-ﬂuorocarbon technologies such as CO2 and 
HCs. 
4.5.3  
Factors affecting emission reduction
The refrigerant charge in industrial systems varies from about 
20 kg up to 10,000 kg or even more. Large ammonia refrigera-
tion systems contain up to 60,000 kg of refrigerant. The high 
costs of the refrigerants, with the exception of ammonia and

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
CO2, and the large refrigerant charge required for the proper op-
eration of the plant have led to low emissions in industrial sys-
tems. In these systems annual average leakage rates of 7−10% 
are reported (UNEP, 2003); smallest leakage rates are observed 
in ammonia systems because of the pungent smell. Clodic and 
Palandre (2004) estimate somewhat higher annual leakage rates 
(17%) for the category of industrial refrigeration (which also 
includes food processing and cold storage). The abatement 
costs of refrigerant emissions from industrial refrigeration was 
determined to be in the range of 27−37 US$ (2002) per tonne 
CO2 -eq (March, 1998). Cost data were calculated with a dis-
count rate of 8%. 
Design aspects
Industrial refrigeration systems are custom made and designs 
vary greatly from case to case. Due to the increasing require-
ments concerning safety and the quantity of refrigerant used in 
refrigeration systems, a design trend towards indirect systems 
has been observed over the past 10 years. Yet whenever pos-
sible, the majority of systems are still direct. Refrigerant piping 
fabrication and installation has changed from direct erection on 
site towards pre-assembled groups and welded connections (see 
Design aspects in Section 4.4.5 for additional information on 
design and installation practices to minimize refrigerant emis-
sions). 
Minimizing charge
There are limits on design optimization in terms of balancing 
low charge on the one hand against achieving high COPs or 
even stable conditions for liquid temperatures to be delivered 
to heat exchangers on the other. For example, ﬂooded type 
evaporators represent the best technology available for a low 
temperature difference between the liquid to be cooled and 
distributed and the evaporating refrigerant, yet this requires 
large quantities of refrigerant. The increased use of plate heat 
exchangers, plate and shell heat exchangers, and printed circuit 
heat exchangers over the past 15 years has enabled the design 
of lower charge systems with ﬂooded evaporators. Efforts to 
minimize the amount of refrigerant charge will continue with 
improvements in system technology.
Improved servicing practices
Trained service personnel are, according to safety standards 
(CEN-378, 2000/2001; ISO-5149, 1993), required for the main-
tenance and operation of industrial systems. Service and main-
tenance practices on industrial systems are updated periodically 
according to safety standards and service contracts, which are 
negotiated with the plant owner in the majority of the cases.
Recovery and recycling
Recovery of refrigerants from industrial plants is common in 
many countries and is sometimes also a requirement (CEN-378, 
2000 and 2001). The recovery of small quantities of ammonia 
(less than 3 kg) through absorption in water is common prac-
tice. Larger quantities are recovered by special large recovery 
units and pressure vessels. 
 
The recovery rate from industrial systems is high due to the 
high costs and quantity of the refrigerants, especially CFCs, 
HCFCs and HFCs. The recovery rate is estimated to be 92−97% 
of the refrigerant charge (UNEP, 2003). The recovered refriger-
ants are dried in the recovery systems on site and re-used.
Lifetime refrigerant emissions
As most industrial refrigeration systems are designed for specif-
ic manufacturing processes, information on lifetime emissions 
of refrigerants are not readily available. Even data on cooling 
capacities are often not ofﬁcial, as the production capacity of 
the manufactured product could be estimated from this data. 
However, the estimated annual leakage rates referred to in 
Section 4.5.3 should be noted.
4.5.4 
HFC technologies
HFC refrigerants are options to replace CFC-114, CFC-12, 
CFC-13, R-502 and HCFC-22. The preferred HFCs are HFC-
134a, HFC-23 and HFC-blends with insigniﬁcant temperature 
glide such as R-404A, R-410A and azeotropic blends like R-
507A.
 
HFC-134a has completely replaced CFC-12 because of its 
comparable thermodynamic properties in various applications 
of industrial refrigeration. CFC-12 and HFC-134a are used in 
large systems for higher temperatures with evaporator tempera-
tures from 15°C down to –10°C.
 
HFC-23 has replaced CFC-13 and to lesser extent CFC-503 
for the same reasons as mentioned for CFC-12. The evaporator 
temperature range varies from –80°C to –55°C in the low-tem-
perature applications of these refrigerants.
 
HFC-245fa, HFC-365mfc and HFC-236fa are possible 
replacements for CFC-114 in high-temperature heat pumps. No 
single ﬂuid is ideal, especially for large industrial heat pumps, 
because the dew line of the ﬂuids requires large superheat to 
avoid compression in the vapour region. The temperature range 
for condensing temperatures varies from 75°C to 100°C.
 
HFC-410A is not comparable to refrigerants HCFC-22 
or CFC-12 in terms of thermodynamic properties because of 
its considerably higher vapour pressure. HFC-410A compres-
sor efﬁciencies, the pressure drop in suction lines and the heat 
transfer efﬁciency will beneﬁt from high system pressure. This 
HFC is used mainly in new industrial systems designed for the 
refrigerant, especially in terms of low condensing temperatures 
of 35°C to avoid pressures higher than 25 bar. In industrial re-
frigeration, the evaporator temperature range for HFC-410A 
varies from –60°C to –35°C. Due to the high volumetric capac-
ity (40% above that of HCFC-22), compressor efﬁciency has 
been reported to be higher than with HCFC-22 (Meurer and 
König, 1999). R-410A has a COP similar to NH3 and HCFC-22 
and slightly higher than that of R-404A, R-507A. Further, at 
temperatures below –40°C and up to the to HFC-410A normal 
boiling point at –51.6°C, COPs are slightly higher for R-410A 
compared to other refrigerants (Roth et al., 2002).

Chapter 4: Refrigeration
253
R-404A and R-507A are the main refrigerants to replace R-502 
in the temperature range from –50°C to –30°C and these have 
comparable cycle efﬁciencies (COPs) and slightly lower GWP 
values than R-502. For systems with R-404A and R-507A, the 
liquid should be subcooled to achieve optimum efﬁciencies and 
high cost-effectiveness . In chiller applications with screw com-
pressors it may also be necessary to add signiﬁcant superheat to 
the suction gas in order to avoid refrigerant condensation in the 
oil separator.
4.5.5 
Non-HFC technologies
In large systems CFCs and recently introduced HFCs have a 
lower average share in industrial refrigeration than NH3 and 
HCFC-22. For new industrial systems designers and plant own-
ers will mainly need to decide between NH3, HFCs and HCFC-
22 (except in the EU where HCFC-22 is forbidden in new sys-
tems) (Stoecker, 1998). Non-HFC technologies described in the 
following subsection are sorted by refrigerant.
Ammonia
Ammonia is one of the leading refrigerants for industrial refrig-
eration, based on performance and safety, and is used in large 
quantities in locations physically separated from general public 
access. The current market share in several European countries, 
especially in Northern Europe, is estimated to be up to 80% 
(UNEP, 1998). In the USA, ammonia has approximately 90% 
market share in systems of 100 kW cooling capacity and above 
that use custom-engineered processes (IIR, 1996).
 
New ammonia systems have an improved design, use low-
temperature materials and standardized welding procedures, 
and the systems operation and maintenance are under continu-
ous monitoring. A human error or direct physical damage is of-
ten the reason for failure (Lindborg, 2003). 
 
Charge reduction has been achieved through dry or direct 
expansion in plate type heat exchangers and shell and tube 
evaporators. With soluble oils, it has been possible to reduce 
charge by 10%. New developments showed charges of 28g am-
monia per kW cooling capacity for low overall capacity down 
to 100 kW (Behnert and König, 2003). With these low charges, 
new opportunities for applications not previously considered 
for ammonia have been realized, such as water chillers for air 
conditioning (Stoecker, 1998). This new ammonia technology 
with high COP was regarded as being fully practical, but strong 
market penetration has not been achieved due to price competi-
tion with HFC-based units (UNEP, 2003).
HCFC-22
The use of HCFC-22 is declining in industrial refrigeration in 
Europe, as the use of HCFC-22 in new systems is forbidden by 
European regulations (Ofﬁcial Journal, 2000). 
 
In developing countries, HCFC-22 is still an important 
replacement refrigerant for CFCs in new systems, as from a 
technical point of view HCFC-22 could replace CFC-12 and 
CFC-502 in new systems. Another important consideration in 
developing countries is that under the Montreal Protocol the 
production of HCFC-22 is allowed until 2040, or the full life-
times of equipment installed in the next 15 years or so. 
Hydrocarbons (HCs)
HCs can ﬁt into any temperature range for evaporating tempera-
tures down to –170°C. Historically, their use as working ﬂuids 
has been restricted to large refrigeration plants within the oil and 
gas industry. A certain registered increase in hydrocarbon con-
sumption has mainly appeared in these sectors (Stoecker, 1998).
  
Commercialized products used in industrial refrigeration 
equipment include HC-290 and HC-1270. System performance 
with regard to system efﬁciency is comparable to and, in some 
cases even superior to, that of the halocarbons. Hydrocarbons are 
soluble with mineral oils and compatible with materials such as 
metals and elastomers that are traditionally used in refrigeration 
equipment. The use of hydrocarbons in screw compressors may 
be problematic due to the strong dilution of mineral oil. Other 
less soluble lubricants such as PAG or PAO may be required. 
As long as safety aspects are taken into consideration, standard 
refrigeration practices used for HCFCs and CFCs can be used 
for hydrocarbon ﬂuids without major system detriment.
 
Given the ﬂammability concerns, design considerations as 
detailed in the relevant safety standards should be adhered to. 
Additional safety measures are required for repairing and ser-
vicing. Several national and European standards permit the use 
of HCs in industrial applications and lay down speciﬁc safety 
requirements. Industry guidelines for the safe use of hydrocar-
bon refrigerants are available (ACRIB, 2001).
Carbon dioxide (CO2)
As well as being non-ODP and having a GWP of 1, carbon di-
oxide (CO2) offers a number of other advantages: 
• Excellent thermophysical properties, leading to high heat 
transfer; 
• Efﬁcient compression and compact system design due to 
high volumetric capacity;
• Non-ﬂammable and low toxicity;
• Low system costs at evaporation temperatures below �45°C 
(depending on system design);
• Widely available at low cost.
CO2 systems can be used for industrial refrigeration applica-
tions with evaporation temperatures down to –52°C and con-
densing temperatures up to 5°C. CO2 is also increasingly being 
used in the low stage of cascade systems for industrial refrig-
eration. CO2 is also commonly used as a secondary refrigerant. 
The design requires the same pressure of 25 bar for the second-
ary refrigerant systems and for the CO2 used as the refrigerant, 
except for ice rinks and some other limited systems which are 
designed for 40 bar. Defrosting was an open issue, but the most 
recent developments show that several different techniques 
such as electrical heating, hot gas defrosting, high-pressure liq-
uid evaporation and the distribution of hot gas have been real-
ized in plants (Siegel and Metger, 2003).

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
A comparative study for low temperatures has been carried out 
using a typical system design with cooling capacities of 600kW 
at −54°C for R-410A, R-507 and ammonia used as a single ﬂuid 
in two-stage systems and for NH3/CO2 and HFC-134a/R-410A 
as refrigerants in high/low stage cascade systems. The volumet-
ric refrigerating capacity of CO2 is ﬁve times higher than HFC-
410A and eight times higher than for ammonia and other refrig-
erants. Therefore the size of most components in the system can 
be reduced. The study found the lowest cost for NH3/CO2 (Roth 
et al., 2002). If CO2 is used as the refrigerant, the cost break-
even point for industrial refrigeration compared to NH3 and R-
410A is approximately at an evaporating temperature of –40°C 
to −45°C. Below this temperature, lower costs for CO2/NH3 
cascade systems have been achieved. It is expected that costs 
for screw or reciprocating units, including compressors and oil 
separation circuit, will be further reduced (Roth et al., 2002). 
The efﬁciency of CO2 systems in this low temperature range is 
similar to other refrigerants such as R-410A or ammonia. 
 
CO2 shows strong cost beneﬁts if the system size is in-
creased, especially in cases where evaporators or heat exchang-
ers are distributed and long piping systems are required. In 
industrial refrigeration applications, cost beneﬁts have been 
achieved with total pipe runs of more than 2500 m (Siegel and 
Metzger, 2003).
 
In food processing, a trend can be observed towards CO2 as 
a refrigerant at temperatures lower than –45°C and as an HTF 
for cooling temperatures lower than −5°C (Pirard, 2002). 
 
Some examples are given to illustrate the use of CO2 as re-
frigerant in low-temperature applications: 
• In the USA, the ﬁrst large CO2 system was being erected in 
2003 with cooling capacities of 6 MW (Stellar, 2003); 
• In Japan a standard low-temperature cascade system has 
been developed with NH3/CO2 as refrigerants. The systems 
are designed for evaporating temperatures of –40 to –55°C 
with cooling capacities of 80−4450 kW; 
• In Europe more than 30 large systems with CO2 as the heat 
transfer ﬂuid and refrigerant have been installed since 1998 
and are operating with total cooling capacities of more than 
25 MW (Pearson, 2004a,b); 
• At least two large systems in Europe have been retroﬁtted 
from HCFC-22 (1.5 MW at −45 to −55°C) and from CFC-
13B1 (2.4 MW at −35°C) to NH3/CO2 cascade systems 
(Gebhardt, 2001; König, 2002).
4.5.6 
Trends in consumption
The trends in the consumption of refrigerants for industrial re-
frigeration as well as the food processing and cold storage sub-
sector are discussed in Section 4.4.6.
4.5.7 
Comparison of HFC and non-HFC technologies 
4.6.7.1 
Energy efﬁciency and performance
On a worldwide basis, only two refrigerants have signiﬁcant 
market share in industrial refrigeration: ammonia and HCFC-
22. Stoecker (1998) provides a comparison of both refriger-
ants. Compared to ammonia and HCFC-22, the market share 
of HFCs and non-HFC technologies is small. Nevertheless, one 
point of comparison is the cost of the refrigerant to be used 
in the system, and the lowest costs are found for ammonia 
(Stoecker, 1998).
 
The energy efﬁciency comparisons for HFCs 404A, 507A, 
and 410A with ammonia and HCFC-22 are described in Section 
4.5.4. HFC410A has an energy efﬁciency similar to ammonia 
and HCFC-22, and slightly higher than R-404A and R-507A 
(Roth et al., 2002).
 
CO2 technology is a non-HFC technology which is gaining 
momentum. The energy efﬁciency of CO2 systems in the tem-
perature range of –40oC to –45oC is similar to HCFC-22 and 
HFC refrigerants such as HFC-410A. CO2 also shows strong 
cost beneﬁt if the system size is large (Siegel and Metzger, 
2003). 
4.5.7.2 
TEWI/LCCP/LCA
For various reasons, only limited TEWI/LCCP/LCA data are 
available for industrial refrigeration systems. Such systems are 
normally custom-designed for special requirements and are 
erected on site. The design differs not only in terms of cooling 
capacities and temperatures, but also in terms of temperature 
control requirements (air blast cooling systems), size of pip-
ing, distance to consumers and charge of refrigerant. There are 
therefore only a few references which compare TEWI and costs 
for the same application (Pearson , 2004a; Roth et al., 2002). 
Roth et al. (2002) give a comparative example for a manufac-
turing plant with a cooling capacity of 600 kW at −54°C  (see 
Figures 4.1 and 4.2). In this investigation the combination of 
CO2 and ammonia was more competitive than other solutions.
 
In addition to the above references, examples of LCCP cal-
culations for supermarket refrigeration systems  provide gener-
al guidance for selecting systems and refrigerants with a lower 
LCCP (see Section 4.3). Lower LCCP results from systems 
with low energy consumption, and in the case of ﬂuorocarbon 
refrigerants, low refrigerant charge size and low refrigerant 
emissions. LCCP calculations should be used to optimize the 
choice of refrigerant and system design for the lowest environ-
mental impact.

Transport refrigeration
4.6.1 
Introduction
The transport refrigeration subsector consists of refrigeration 
systems for transporting chilled or frozen goods. Typically the 
task of a transport refrigeration system is to keep the tempera-
ture constant during transport. The technical requirements for 
transport refrigeration units are more severe than for many oth-
er applications of refrigeration. The equipment has to operate 
in a wide range of ambient temperatures and under extremely 
variable weather conditions (sun radiation, rain, etc.); it also 
has to be able to carry any one of a wide range of cargoes with

differing temperature requirements, and it must be robust and 
reliable in the often severe transport environment (IIR, 2003). 
Typical modes of transport are road, rail, air and sea. In addi-
tion, systems which are independent of a moving carrier are 
also used; such systems are generally called ‘intermodal’ and 
can be found as containers (combined sea-land transport) as 
well as swap bodies (combined road and rail transport). This 
section covers also the use of refrigeration in ﬁshing vessels 
where the refrigeration systems are used for both food process-
ing and storage.
 
The technology used in transport refrigeration is mainly the 
mechanically- or electrically-driven vapour compression cycle 
using refrigerants such as CFC, HCFC, HFC, ammonia or car-
bon dioxide. Due to the complete and worldwide phase-out of 
CFC consumption by the end of 2009, CFCs are not addressed 
in this chapter. In addition, a number of refrigeration systems 
are based on using substances in discontinuous uses. This type 
of equipment can be found as open uses with solid or liquid 
CO2, ice, or liquid nitrogen and in these cases the refrigerant 
is being completely emitted and lost after removing the heat 
(Viegas, 2003). Closed systems such as eutectic plates (Cube 
et al., 1997) or ﬂow-ice, reuse the same substance (Paul, 1999). 
Such systems used to be very commonplace in transport refrig-
eration, and are still used on a signiﬁcant scale. Some propose 
that their use should be increased in the future. 
 
All transport refrigeration systems need to be compact and 
lightweight, as well as highly robust and sturdy so that they can 
withstand movements and accelerations during transportation. 
Despite these efforts, leaks within the refrigeration system occur 
due to vibrations, sudden shocks and so forth. The likelihood of 
leaks or ruptures is also greater than with stationary systems, 
due to a higher risk of collisions with other objects. Ensuring 
safe operation with all working ﬂuids is essential, particularly 
in the case of ships where there are no options to evacuate a 
larger area (SCANVAC, 2001). The safety is either inherent in 
the ﬂuids or is ensured through a number of technical measures 
(Stera, 1999). 
4.6.2 
Container transport
Refrigerated containers allow uninterrupted storage during 
transport on different types of mobile platforms, for example 
railways, road trucks and ships. The two main types of refrig-
erated containers are porthole containers and integral contain-
ers. Porthole containers are the older of the two concepts and 
are insulated containers with two front apertures and no built-
in refrigeration systems. Some predict that by 2006, transport 
will have been completely converted to integral containers 
(Hochhaus, 2003; Wild, 2003). 
  
Integral refrigerated containers are systems which have their 
own small refrigeration unit of about 5 kW refrigeration capac-
ity on board. There were more than 550,000 of these in 2000, 
representing the transport capacity of 715,000 20-foot con-
tainers, and there numbers are set to strongly increase (UNEP, 
2003; Sinclair, 1999; Stera, 1999). The electrical power needed 
to drive the system is supplied from an external power sup-
ply via an electrical connection. These systems typically use 
HFC-134a, R-404A and HCFC-22, and in some cases R-407C 
(Wild, 2003). Newer systems generally have a more leak-resis-
tant design (Crombie, 1999; Stera, 1999; Yoshida et al., 2003; 
Wild, 2003). In 1998, when older design systems were preva-
lent, an average annual leakage rate of 20% of the charge of 
about 5 kg was assumed for a lifetime of 15 years (Kauffeld and 
Christensen, 1998). 
4.6.3 
Sea transport and ﬁshing vessels
Virtually all of the 35,000 plus merchant ships worldwide larger 
than 500 gross tonnes (Hochhaus, 1998) have some on-board 
refrigeration system. The majority of systems use HCFC-22. 
These refrigeration systems and options for emission abatement 
are referred to in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of this report. In terms 
of technology and performance, chillers for air conditioning 
or, in case of naval vessels for electronics and weapon system 
cooling, are similar to stationary systems (see section 5.1 on air 
conditioning). The following remarks and information relate to 
ship-bound refrigeration systems essential to the main purpose 
of non-naval vessels, namely the transportation of perishable 
products, the chilling of ﬁsh and the like. 
 
Refrigerated transport vessels, also called reefers, provide 
transportation for perishable foodstuff at temperatures between 
–30°C and 16°C (Cube et al., 1997). It is estimated that there 
are around 1300 to 1400 reefer vessels in operation (Hochhaus, 
2002; Hochhaus, 1998), a number which has been constant for 
quite some time and is expected to decrease. In 2001, it was 
reported that more than 95% of the refrigeration installations on 
these vessels use HCFC-22 as a refrigerant (SCANVAC, 2001), 
although various HFCs such as HFC-134a, R-404A, R-507 and 
R-407C as well as ammonia are being used. About two-thirds of 
the systems are direct systems with up to 5 tonnes of refrigerant 
per system and the remaining are indirect systems with a charge 
below 1 tonne of refrigerant (UNEP, 2003). Estimates of cur-
rent annual leakage rates based on known refrigerant consump-
tion are 15−20% of the system charge (SCANVAC, 2001). 
 
Worldwide there about  1.3 million decked and about 1.0 
million undecked, powered ﬁshing vessels. In 2001, more than 
21,500 ﬁshing vessels over 100 gross tonnes were recorded 
(FAO, 2002), with a slightly decreasing trend. Vessels of that 
size are assumed to operate internationally and to be equipped 
with signiﬁcant refrigeration equipment. Within a wide range, 
the average larger ﬁshing vessel has a refrigerant charge in the 
order of 2000 kg with 15−20% annual leakage rate. In 2001 
more than 95% of such vessels in Europe used HCFC-22 as the 
refrigerant (SCANVAC, 2001). It is assumed that 15% of the 
ﬂeet have full size refrigeration systems, while the remaining 
ﬂeet is assumed to be equipped with small refrigeration systems 
that have a ﬁlling mass of approximately 100 kg. 
 
Specialized tankers are used to transport liqueﬁed gases, in 
particular liqueﬁed petrol gas (LPG) and liqueﬁed natural gas 
(LNG). Medium and large LNG tankers transport LNG at nor-

mal pressure. The refrigeration effect needed for this type of 
transport is provided by evaporating the LNG, which is recon-
densed using specialized refrigeration units. Since the number 
of such ships is limited (about 150 ships of above 50,000 tonnes 
were registered in 1996) (Cube et al., 1997) and the refrigera-
tion equipment typically uses the transported, low GWP hydro-
carbon gases as the refrigerant, refrigeration use in gas tankers 
is not further considered in this report. 
4.6.4 
Road transport
Road transport refrigeration units, with the exception of refrig-
eration containers, are van, truck or trailer mounted systems. 
Some trailers are equipped to be mounted or have their main 
bodies mounted on railroad systems; these are so-called swap-
bodies. In a number of uses those systems are of the discon-
tinuous type, using eutectic plates in closed systems (Cube et 
al., 1997) or liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide or solid car-
bon dioxide in open systems (UNEP, 2003). These systems are 
frequently used in local frozen food distribution, for example, 
delivery directly to the customer (Cube et al., 1997). Liquid 
nitrogen for cooling purposes is used by more than 1000 ve-
hicles in the UK. Liquid carbon dioxide is reported to be used 
in 50 trucks in Sweden (UNEP, 2003). In general, the necessity 
for storage and ﬁlling logistics, the hazardous handling of very 
cold liquids and solids and the energetically unfavourable low-
temperature storage reduce the widespread application of these 
historically frequently used technologies. 
 
The predominant technology in road transport, covering vir-
tually all of the remaining refrigerated road transport equipment, 
is the mechanical vapour compression cycle. Trailers usually 
have unitary equipment that consists of a diesel engine, com-
pressor, condenser, engine radiator and evaporator with fans as 
well as refrigerant and controls. These systems are also used 
for swap bodies. Larger trucks often have similar equipment 
as trailers. However, as the truck size decreases an increasing 
proportion of systems have the compressor being driven by the 
drive engine (ASHRAE, 2002). Alternatively, some truck sys-
tems use a generator coupled with the truck engine to generate 
electricity, which is then used to drive the compressor (Cube et 
al., 1997). 
 
In 1999, it was estimated that in North America alone 300,000 
refrigerated trailers were in use (Lang, 1999). For the 15 coun-
tries of the European Union in 2000, 120,000 small trucks, vans 
and eutectic systems with 2 kg refrigerant charge were estimated 
to be in use, with 70,000 mid-size trucks of 5 kg refrigerant ﬁll-
ing and 90,000 trailers with 7.5 kg refrigerant ﬁlling (Valentin, 
1999). The worldwide numbers in 2002 were estimated to total 
1,200,000 units, with 30% trailer units, 40% independent truck 
units and 30% smaller units. The annual amount of refrigerant 
needed for service is reported to be 20−25% of the refrigerant 
charge (UNEP, 2003). The refrigerant typically chosen is HFC-
134a for applications where only cooling is needed, and pre-
dominantly R-404A and R-410A for freezing applications and 
general-purpose refrigeration units (UNEP, 2003).
4.6.5 
Railway transport
Refrigerated railway transport is used in North America, Europe, 
Asia and Australia. The transport is carried out by using either 
refrigerated railcars, or refrigerated containers (combined sea-
land transport; see Section 4.6.2) or swap bodies (combined 
road-land transport; see Section 4.6.4). This section concen-
trates on transport in refrigerated railcars.
 
Different technologies have been used in the past: Solid CO2 
as well as ice have been used in discontinuous emissive systems 
to date (CTI, 2004). Mechanically-driven refrigeration systems 
have also been used and are now the prime choice because of 
the typically long duration of trips, which makes reﬁlling of the 
emitted refrigerant in discontinuous emissive systems a chal-
lenge for both logistical and cost reasons. 
 
Mechanically driven systems are almost completely 
equipped with diesel engines to supply the necessary energy to 
the refrigeration unit. The existing ﬂeets of railcars in Asia still 
seem to mostly operate on one-stage (cooling) and two-stage 
(freezing /combined use) CFC-12 systems (UNEP, 2003). The 
European railcars have been converted to HFC-134a (Cube et 
al., 1997), and this has been facilitated by European regula-
tions phasing out the use of CFCs (EC No 2037/2000 (Ofﬁcial 
Journal, 2000)). In North America, existing older systems have 
been converted to HFC-134a, while newer systems utilize HFC-
134a and R-404A (DuPont, 2004). 
 
The lifetime of newer rail refrigeration systems, which are 
often easily replaceable units originally developed for road 
transport and only adapted for rail use, is believed to be 8 to 
10 years with a running time of 1000 to 1200 hours per annum 
(refrigeratedtrans.com, 2004). Older units speciﬁcally designed 
for rail use have a lifetime of typically 40 years and a refriger-
ant ﬁlling of approximately 15 kg (UNEP, 2003). The annual 
leakage rate may be assumed to be at least similar to the leakage 
rate experienced in road transport, that is 20−25% of the refrig-
erant charge (UNEP, 2003).
4.6.6 
Air transport
In order to provide constant low temperature during the ﬂight, 
containers to be loaded upon aircraft are provided with refriger-
ation systems. There are some battery powered mechanical re-
frigeration systems (Stera, 1999), but the total number of these 
is believed to be small. Other, more commonly used systems 
are discontinuous with solid carbon dioxide (Sinclair, 1999; 
ASHRAE, 2002), or ice (ASHRAE, 2002). As the amount of 
ODS replacement during use is apparently very small, air trans-
port will not be detailed further in this report. 
4.6.7 
Abatement options
4.6.7.1 
General
Based on the study of Clodic and Palandre (2004), the total 
amount of refrigerant contained in transport refrigeration sys-
tems is estimated to be 16,000 tonnes; 6000 tonnes of this are

emitted annually. It should be noted that the widespread use of 
R-404A as a non-ODS alternative with a relatively high GWP of 
3800 kg CO2 kg-1 leads to very high CO2-equivalent emissions. 
Using alternatives in systems with a more moderate GWP than 
R-404A, such as the HFC mixture R-410A, would cut the CO2-
equivalent emissions substantially. 
 
Current system requirements lead to a refrigerant selection 
which is largely limited to HFC-134a and refrigerant mixtures 
with a relatively high global-warming impact such as R-404A. 
Since the emission rates in operation are signiﬁcant, improve-
ments in energy consumption, alternative substances and not-in-
kind technologies are the main options for emission abatement. 
R-404A is the main refrigerant in current use (IIR, 2002) and 
is popular because of its ﬂexibility (medium- and low-tempera-
ture applications) and safety. Only a limited number of TEWI 
calculations are available in the literature; the only investigation 
comparing different technologies such as CFC-12, HFC-134a, 
R-404A, HC-600a/HC-290, ammonia and CO2, states that R-
404A systems are at least sustainable from the different options 
investigated for reefer ships (Meffert and Ferreira, 2003).
4.6.7.2 
Containment
As there are already considerable incentives to optimize de-
sign and to minimize leakage, further containment in most uses 
would require a new approach not yet seen. One example might 
be to use fully hermetic systems for road transport (Chopko 
and Stumpf, 2003a, b), although the effect of this on energy 
consumption has yet to be determined. The development of 
hermetic scroll compressors for container systems with accept-
able energy efﬁciency for both cooling and freezing applica-
tions (Yoshida et al., 2003; DeVore, 1998) allows their wide-
spread use, and leads to less service requirements and therefore 
less related refrigerant losses. In addition, these compressors 
are hermetic, which further decreases leaks (Wild, 2003). This 
technology has already been introduced and is penetrating the 
market as existing equipment is gradually replaced. 
 
Recovery and recycling is a statutory requirement in many 
countries and is probably adhered to since the equipment con-
tains a considerable, but still easy-to-handle, amount of refrig-
erant and due to its mobility it can easily be transported to a 
recovery facility (except seagoing). On the other hand due to 
the large emission rates in operation, the improvements through 
recovery and recycling, which encompass only the refrigerant 
losses during service and disposal, are likely to be limited. 
 
An alternative approach to improving systems to reduce 
leaks might be to improve operating conditions to reduce wear, 
likeliness of ruptures and refrigerant losses during service. The 
potential of such measures compared to system-related im-
provements has yet to be assessed, but might be considerable. 
 
4.6.7.3 
Improvement in energy efﬁciency
Most refrigeration systems operate under partial load condi-
tions for a large proportion of their useful life (Meffert and 
Ferreira, 1999). Different methods for partial load control have 
been investigated for both electrically driven compressors and 
open compressors (e.g. Crombie, 1999). Potential energy sav-
ings for electrical systems using frequency converters are said 
to reach up to 25.8% per voyage (Han and Gan, 2003). Other 
sources compare a range of control possibilities (Meffert and 
Ferreira, 1999 and 2003). These sources concluded that energy 
efﬁciency gains of more than 70% can be achieved under part-
load conditions. 
4.6.7.4 
Discontinuous processes
The use of ice as well as solid CO2 are both established alterna-
tives to vapour compression systems. Besides the logistical ne-
cessities of such systems, there are also temperature limitations 
for the use of ice as well as handling and energy issues when 
using solid CO2 (as heat absorption is energetically unfavour-
able at –78.4°C). These issues are even more valid for the use of 
liquid nitrogen, producing an unnecessarily low temperature of 
–195.8°C, or liquid air with –194.3°C. Nevertheless, refriger-
ated systems using ice and solid CO2 systems remain abatement 
option for HFC in suitable cases.
 
The commercialization of a fully self-powered liquid CO2 
system with a moderate evaporation temperature of –51°C for 
the delivery of frozen product to customers was reported by 
Viegas (2003), and this addressed handling as well as energy 
efﬁciency issues. The system, which needs a service infrastruc-
ture, has been commercialized in Sweden (Viegas, 2003) and 
the UK (UNEP, 2003) and is therefore available as an abate-
ment option, especially for local and short-haul transport. 
 
The use of a pumpable suspension of ice crystals in water 
(‘binary ice’, ‘ﬂow ice’), has been developed for certain trans-
port uses. The suspension is pumped into the hollow walls, 
ﬂoors, ceilings or trays of a containment to be refrigerated. 
While equipment for service trolleys for passenger trains is 
already commercially available, the same principle is being 
suggested for containers (Paul, 1999). Although the remain-
ing technical issues seem to be standard engineering tasks, the 
technology is not yet commercially available for cooling of full 
containers, trucks or vans.
4.6.7.5 
Sorption processes
Sorption processes are well known, heat-driven processes using 
water, methanol or ammonia as a refrigerant, and solids such as 
activated coal, zeolite or silica gel (adsorption) as well as liq-
uids such as lithium bromide (LiBr) and water (absorption) as 
sorbents in a closed circuit. The heat to drive such processes can 
come from a variety of sources; in the case of transport refrig-
eration, the waste heat from the transporter’s engine could be 
used. Such a use has been proposed for several years, especially 
for ship-bound systems (Cube et al., 1997).
 
LiBr-water systems, are frequently used in stationary appli-
cations and for the capacity range of 200 kW−600 kW, these have 
been reported to operate successfully and produce chilled water 
in certain specialized ships (Han and Zheng, 1999). Below zero 
refrigeration is not feasible with LiBr-water systems. As such 
systems have already been successfully employed on ships, 
their utilization might be increased at a relatively short notice. 
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   258

Chapter 4: Refrigeration
259
The applicability to modes of transportation other than ships 
might be limited because of downscaling problems as well as 
design restrictions on those systems.
 
For truck-mounted refrigeration systems, the use of waste 
heat from the truck engine has been suggested to drive a wa-
ter-ammonia sorption cycle (Garrabrant, 2003). For medium 
and small ﬁshing vessels, adsorption ice-makers with carbon-
methanol are being proposed, which utilize the exhaust heat of 
the ship’s engine as an energy source (Wang et al., 2003). 
4.6.7.6 
Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbon cooling systems for the recondensation of trans-
ported hydrocarbons have successfully been installed in gas 
tankers. International activities are underway to develop hydro-
carbon systems for reefer ships (Jakobsen, 1998). In road trans-
port refrigeration, commercially available systems have been 
developed in Australia, Germany and other European countries 
using HC-290 (propane). The systems require a leak detector 
in the trailer and special driver training to fulﬁl safety-related 
legal requirements (UNEP, 2003; Frigoblock, 2004).
 
Technically this solution could be adopted worldwide in cer-
tain road and railroad systems, especially in compact systems. 
Nevertheless, either certain existing regulations or present sys-
tem use patterns would have to be adapted. The ﬂammability 
of hydrocarbons will require additional safety measures, thus 
increasing the costs of the system, and in the beginning at least 
probably insurance rates as well. Containers might also require 
changes in the transporting ships. 
4.6.7.7 
Ammonia 
Ammonia as refrigerant is being increasingly used in marine 
refrigeration equipment. Applications include its use in reefers 
(Stera, 1999), as a proposed refrigerant for sorption ice ma-
chines (Garrabrant, 2003), and the use in ﬁshing vessels both as 
a single refrigerant (UNEP, 2003; Berends, 2002) and in com-
bination with CO2 (Nielsen and Lund, 2003). The applicability 
has been sufﬁciently proven. Ammonia as a refrigerant requires 
certain design considerations as well as the presence of addi-
tional safety equipment on board (SCANVAC, 2001).
 
4.6.7.8 
Carbon Dioxide
Carbon dioxide as a refrigerant in mechanically-driven vapour 
compression systems, might be used as a subcritical refriger-
ant (critical point at 31°C) with a condensing temperature well 
below the critical point in cascade systems or in applications 
where low-temperature cooling options means are available. 
Alternatively, it can be used as a near-critical or, more likely, 
a super-critical working ﬂuid. If the condensing temperature of 
CO2 is below 15°C (border of subcritical region), this refriger-
ant typically offers, but not always, signiﬁcant advantages in 
terms of efﬁciency and costs in comparison to other refriger-
ants. This advantage can only be utilized in cascade systems 
with other refrigerants or where low-temperature heat sinks are 
available. Near- or super-critical uses require a much higher 
pressure resistance of the equipment than is currently usual for 
other refrigerants, and such uses are often energetically less fa-
vourable than other refrigerants in the same temperature range.
 
For low-temperature uses, combinations of ammonia and 
CO2 have been developed and built into ships. A comparison 
shows that the efﬁciency for a –40°C evaporation and 25°C con-
densing temperature is 17% higher than for a 2-stage HCFC-22 
system (25% improvement at –50°C/25°C) (Nielson and Lund, 
2003). The advantage of using CO2 in such applications is that 
the necessary components (in particular the compressor) are 
commercially available or require only minor modiﬁcations, 
while consuming less space than other solutions. 
 
CO2 has also been proposed for container systems, where it 
would typically be used in a super-critical manner. A prototype 
system has yet to be reported as until recently no suitable com-
pressor was available. A prototype CO2 system for trucks has 
been developed, laboratory tested and optimized (Sonnekalb, 
2000). The calculated TEWI shows a 20% decrease compared 
to a R-404A system.
4.6.7.9 
Air
The air cycle for transport refrigeration purposes has been in-
vestigated for a number of years (e.g. Halm, 2000). A prototype 
system has been developed and tested, but has never been com-
mercialized. Presently air cycle equipment for transport refrig-
eration does not seem to represent a suitable short- or medium-
term abatement option due to the lack of suitable and reliable 
components.
4.6.8 
Comparison of alternatives 
Emissions of halocarbons in the transport refrigeration sector 
are related to four subsectors: Sea transport and ﬁshing, road 
transport, rail transport and intermodal transport, that is con-
tainers and swap bodies. An overview can be found in Table 
4.15.
  
There are a number of possibilities to improve those trans-
port refrigeration systems built today to achieve a lowering of 
direct or energy-consumption related emissions without chang-
ing the working ﬂuid or technology. A number of measures have 
been proposed and these have in part already been implemented 
to improve the energy efﬁciency, for example, the use of ef-
ﬁcient compressors, frequency control for part load conditions, 
water-cooled condensers for containers on board ships, regular 
preventive maintenance and so forth. Measures to control direct 
emissions have mainly been proposed for mass-produced sys-
tems (e.g. container units) in terms of design improvements.
 
An alternative to improving the currently predominant halo-
carbon technologies is the replacement of those refrigerants by 
ﬂuids or technologies with a lower GWP. Technically there are 
or will be low GWP replacement options available for all trans-
port refrigeration uses where CFCs, HCFCs or HFCs are cur-
rently used. However in several cases these might increase the 
costs of the refrigeration system.
 
In case of reefer ships and ﬁshing vessels, the most promis-
ing and already implemented non-halocarbon abatement tech-

nology is equipment with ammonia or ammonia/CO2 systems. 
These systems are likely to operate at least as energy efﬁciently 
as existing systems. One source (SCANVAC, 2001) estimates 
the additional costs for a ship-bound ammonia system to be 20− 
30% higher if retroﬁtted into an existing vessel and potentially 
lower if included in the ships planning from the start. Another 
source (Nielsen and Lund, 2003) assumes that small industrial 
ammonia/CO2 systems might be more expensive than conven-
tional systems, but large systems might have a more or less 
equivalent price for the same capacity. 
 
In the case of container systems, CO2 in a vapour compres-
sion cycle could develop into a promising alternative. The costs 
for the refrigeration system might be higher than for current 
conventional systems. The energy consumption will probably 
be higher if the containers are only air-cooled but if additional 
water-cooling is installed, as has already implemented on some 
vessels, the systems could be energetically as good as or even 
better than existing equipment. 
 
Options using CO2 and hydrocarbons exist for road trans-
port. The hydrocarbon technology is technically implementable 
within a short time frame. For larger systems, CO2 systems or 
hydrocarbon refrigerants are potential options, depending on 
the safety issues. The same alternatives could be used for new 
railway systems. Certain types of refrigerated road transport, 
such as short-range distribution trucks, might use discontinuous 
systems with evaporating CO2 or nitrogen as alternative. 
 
As transport refrigeration systems have very signiﬁcant 
emissions and a limited runtime, which is typically far below

100%, direct emissions play a very important role in the cal-
culation of the TEWI. The replacement options currently be-
ing considered by manufacturers do not signiﬁcantly increase 
transport weight or volume. The data is sufﬁcient to state that in 
several applications, a substantial reduction in TEWI could be 
achieved by introducing a low GWP technology.

Chapter 5: Residential and Commercial Air Conditioning and Heating
271
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The various applications, equipment and products included in 
residential and commercial air-conditioning and heating sec-
tor can be classiﬁed in three groups: stationary air conditioners 
(including both equipment that cools air and heat pumps that 
directly heat air), chillers and water-heating heat pumps. 
Stationary Air Conditioners (Heat Pumps for Cooling and 
Heating) 
Air conditioners and air-heating heat pumps generally fall into 
four distinct categories: 
• window-mounted, portable, and through-the-wall;
• non-ducted split residential and commercial;
• ducted residential split and single packaged; 
• ducted commercial split and packaged. 
The vast majority of stationary air conditioners (and air-heat-
ing heat pumps) use vapour-compression cycle technology with 
HCFC-22 refrigerant. This refrigerant is already being phased 
out in some countries ahead of the schedule dictated by the 
Montreal Protocol. In Europe HCFC-22 had been phased out of 
new equipment by 31 December 2003. In the USA, production 
of HCFC-22 for use in new equipment will end on 1 January 
2010. In Japan, HCFC-22 is to be phased out of new equipment 
on 1 January 2010; however, almost all new equipment has al-
ready been converted to HFCs. 
 
The refrigerant options being considered as replacements 
for HCFC-22 are the same for all of the stationary air condi-
tioner categories: HFC-134a, HFC blends, hydrocarbons, and 
CO2. At present, two of these are being used: HFC blends in 
the vast majority of systems and hydrocarbons in a very small 
number of smaller systems.
 
It is estimated that more than 90% of the installed base of 
stationary air conditioners currently use HCFC-22, and an esti-
mated 368 million air-cooled air conditioners and heat pumps 
are installed worldwide. This represents an installed bank of 
approximately 548,000 tonnes of HCFC-22 (UNEP, 2003). 
Water Chillers 
Water chillers combined with air handling and distribution 
systems frequently provide comfort air conditioning in large 
commercial buildings (e.g., hotels, ofﬁces, hospitals and uni-
versities) and to a lesser extent in large multi-family residential 
buildings. Water chillers using the vapour-compression cycle 
are manufactured in capacities ranging from approximately 7 
kW to over 30,000 kW. Two generic types of compressors are 
used: positive displacement and centrifugal. Heat-activated ab-
sorption chillers are available as alternatives to electrical va-
pour-compression chillers. However, in general these are only 
used where waste heat is available or the price of electricity, 
including demand charges, is high. 
 
HFCs (particularly HFC-134a) and HFC blends (particular-
ly R-407C and R-410A) are beginning to replace HCFC-22 in 
new positive-displacement chillers. Ammonia is used in some 
positive-displacement chillers in Europe. The high discharge 
temperatures associated with ammonia permit a greater use 
of heat recovery than is the case for other refrigerants. Some 
chillers which use hydrocarbon refrigerants (as substitute for 
HCFC-22), are also produced in Europe each year.
 
Centrifugal compressors are generally the most efﬁcient 
technology in units exceeding 1700 kW capacity. HCFC-123 
and HFC-134a have replaced CFC-11 and CFC-12, respective-
ly, in new centrifugal chillers produced since 1993. 
Water-Heating Heat Pumps
Water-heating heat pumps using vapour-compression technol-
ogy are manufactured in sizes ranging from 1 kW heating ca-
pacity for single room units, to 50−1000 kW for commercial/
institutional applications, and tens of MW for district heating 
plants. 
 
Various heat sources exist: air, water from ponds and rivers, 
and the ground. Integrated heat pumps that simultaneously heat 
water and cool air are also available.
 
In developed countries, HCFC-22 is still the most commonly 
used refrigerant but HFC alternatives are being introduced. In 
developing countries, CFC-12 is also used to a limited extent. 
HFC refrigerants are used in Europe in equipment produced af-
ter 2003 (EU, 2000).
 
In the area of non-HFC refrigerants, carbon dioxide is be-
ing introduced in domestic, hot-water heat pumps in Japan and 
Norway, ammonia is being used in medium-size and large-ca-
pacity heat pumps in some European countries, and several 
northern-European manufacturers are using propane (HC-290) 
or propylene (HC-1270) as refrigerants in small residential and 
commercial water-to-water and air-to-water heat pumps.
Reduction in HFC emissions 
Options for reducing HFC emissions in residential and com-
mercial air-conditioning and heating equipment involve con-
tainment in HFC vapour-compression systems (applicable 
worldwide and for all equipment) and the use of non-HFC sys-
tems (applicable in certain cases but not all due to economic, 
safety and energy efﬁciency considerations). Non-HFC systems 
include vapour-compression cycles with refrigerants other than 
HFCs, and alternative cycles and methods to produce cooling 
and heating.
 
Containment can be achieved through: 
• the improved design, installation and maintenance of sys-
tems to reduce leakage; 
• designs that minimize refrigerant charge quantities in sys-
tems
• the recovery, recycling and reclaiming of refrigerant during 
servicing, and at equipment disposal. 
A trained labour force using special equipment is needed to 
minimize installation, service and disposal emissions. However, 
implementing best practices for the responsible use of HFCs re-
quires an infrastructure of education, institutions and equipment 
that is not widely available in much of the developing world. 
There is also a role for standards, guidelines, and regulations

on HFC emission reduction that are appropriate for regional or 
local conditions.
 
A number of other non-traditional technologies have been 
examined for their potential to reduce the consumption and 
emission of HFCs. With only a few exceptions, these all suffer 
such large efﬁciency penalties that the resultant indirect effects 
would overwhelm any direct emission reduction beneﬁt.
Global warming effects
Several factors inﬂuence the direct and indirect emission of 
greenhouse gases associated with residential and commercial 
air-conditioning and heating equipment. In those warm climate 
regions where electricity is predominantly generated using fos-
sil fuels, the generation of energy to power air conditioners 
can cause greenhouse-gas emissions that are greater than the 
direct refrigerant emissions by an order of magnitude or more. 
Therefore, improving the integrity of the building envelope (re-
duced heat gain or loss) and other actions to reduce building 
energy consumption can have a very signiﬁcant impact on indi-
rect emissions. In cooler climates where air conditioning is used 
less often, or in locations where power generation emits little or 
no carbon dioxide, the direct emissions can exceed the indirect 
greenhouse-gas emissions. 
 
Residential and commercial air-conditioning and heating 
units are designed to use a given charge of a refrigerant, and not 
to emit that refrigerant to the atmosphere; however, emissions 
can occur due to numerous causes. The effects of refrigerant 
gas emissions are quantiﬁed by multiplying the emissions of a 
refrigerant in kg by its global warming potential (GWP). The 
emissions calculated are on a kgCO2-equivalent basis. If more 
than a few speciﬁc systems are analyzed then it is appropriate 
to use average annual emission rates for each type of system to 
calculate the comparative direct greenhouse-gas emissions.

5.1 
Stationary air conditioners (heat pumps for 
cooling and heating) 
The several applications, equipment and products that are in-
cluded in the sector of residential and commercial air condi-
tioning and heating can be classiﬁed in three groups: stationary 
air conditioners (this section), chillers (section 5.2), and water 
heating heat pumps (section 5.3).
Air-cooled air conditioners and heat pumps, ranging in size 
from 2.0−700 kW, account for the vast majority of the resi-
dential and light-commercial air-conditioning market. In fact, 
over 90% of the air-conditioning units produced in the world 
are smaller than 15 kW. In the rest of this chapter the term air 
conditioners will be used for air conditioners and heat pumps 
that directly cool or heat air. 
5.1.1 
Technologies and applications
The vast majority of air conditioners use the vapour-compres-
sion cycle technology, and generally fall into four distinct cat-
egories: 
• window-mounted, portable and through-the-wall air condi-
tioners;
• non-ducted or duct-free split residential and commercial air 
conditioners; 
• ducted residential split and single package air conditioners; 
• ducted commercial split and packaged air conditioners.
5.1.1.1 
Window-mounted, through-the-wall, and portable 
air conditioners
Due to their small size and relatively low cost, window-mount-
ed, through-the-wall, and portable air conditioners1 are used 
in small shops and ofﬁces as well as private residences. They 
range in capacity from less than 2.0 kW to 10.5 kW. These types 
of air conditioners have factory-sealed refrigerant cycles that 
do not require ﬁeld-installed connections between the indoor 
and outdoor sections. Therefore refrigerant leaks resulting from 
imperfect installation practices do not occur in these systems 
unless the unit is damaged during installation and service and a 
leak results. Representative refrigerant leakage rates are in the 
order of 2−2.5% of the factory charge per year (UNEP, 2003). 
5.1.1.2 
Non-ducted (or duct-free) split air conditioners
In many parts of the world, non-ducted split air conditioners 
are used for residential and light-commercial air-conditioning. 
Non-ducted split air conditioners include a compressor/heat ex-
changer unit installed outside the space to be cooled or heated. 
The outdoor unit is connected via refrigerant piping to one 
(‘single-split’) or more (‘multi-split’) indoor units (fan coils) 
located inside the conditioned space. Capacities range from 
2.2−28 kW for a single split, and from 4.5−135 kW for a multi-
split. Representative leakage rates for single split are in the or-
der of 4−5% of the nominal charge per year (UNEP, 2003). As 
multi-split air conditioners have more connections the probabil-
ity of leaks is higher.
5.1.1.3 
Ducted split residential air conditioners
Ducted split residential air conditioners have a duct system that 
supplies cooled or heated air to each room of a residence or in-
dividual zones within commercial or institutional buildings. A 
compressor/heat exchanger unit outside the conditioned space 
supplies refrigerant to a single indoor coil (heat exchanger) in-
stalled within the duct system or air handler. Capacities range 
from 5−17.5 kW. Representative leakage rates are in the order 
of 4−5% of the nominal charge per year (UNEP, 2003). 
5.1.1.4 
Ducted, commercial, split and packaged air 
conditioners 
Ducted, commercial, split-system units must be matched with 
an indoor air handler and heat exchanger. Packaged units con-
tain an integral blower and heat exchanger section that is con-
nected to the air distribution system. The majority of ducted, 
commercial split and single package air conditioners are mount-
ed on the roof of ofﬁce, retail or restaurant buildings or on the 
ground adjacent to the building. The typical range of capacities 
for these products is 10-700 kW. 
Representative leakage rates are in the order of 4−5% of the 
factory charge per year (UNEP, 2003).
5.1.2 
Refrigerant use and equipment population
There are no global statistics on the percentage of air-cooled 
air conditioners that have been manufactured with non ozone 
depleting refrigerants. However, it is estimated that more than 
90% of the installed base of stationary air conditioners current-
ly uses HCFC-22 (UNEP, 2003).
 
Estimates of the installed base (number of units) and re-
frigerant inventory were made using a computer model which 
predicts the number of units and refrigerant in the installed pop-
ulation on the basis of production data and product longevity 
models (UNEP, 2003).
 
An estimated 358 million air-cooled air conditioners (cool-
ing and heating) are installed worldwide with a total capacity 
of 2.2 x 109 kW cooling. Refrigerant charge quantities vary in 
relation to the capacity. Assuming an average charge of 0.25 
kg per kW of capacity, those 358 million units represent an 
installed bank of approximately 550,000 tonnes of HCFC-22 
(Table 5.1).
 
HCFC-22 is already being phased out in some countries, 
which elected to phase out ahead of the schedule dictated by the 
Montreal Protocol. In Europe HCFC-22 had been phased out of 
new equipment by 31 December 2003. In the USA HCFC-22 
1 Portable air conditioners are a special class of room air conditioners designed 
to be rolled from room to room. They draw condenser air from the conditioned 
space or from outdoors and exhaust it outdoors. The air ﬂows from and to out-
doors through small ﬂexible ducts which typically go through a window. In 
some models condenser cooling is further augmented by the evaporation of con-
densate and water from a reservoir in the unit.

will be phased out of new equipment on 1 January 2010. In 
Japan HCFC-22 is due to be phased out of new equipment on 1 
January 2010, but almost all new equipment has already been 
converted to HFCs.
 
The refrigerant options being considered as replacements 
for HCFC-22 are the same for all of the stationary air condi-
tioner categories: HFC-134a, HFC blends, hydrocarbons, and 
CO2. At present, two of these are being used: HFC blends, and 
hydrocarbons (propane, a propane/ethane blend, and propyl-
ene). 
5.1.2.1 
HFC blends
To date, the vast majority of air conditioners using non ozone 
depleting refrigerants have used HFC blends. Two HFC blends 
currently dominate the replacement of HCFC-22 in new air-
cooled air conditioners. These are R-407C and R-410A. A few 
other HFC blends have been investigated and/or commercial-
ized as refrigerants; however, none have been widely used in 
new or existing (retroﬁt) air conditioners. There is a limited use 
of R-419A and R-417A as ‘drop-in’ refrigerants in some CEIT 
countries.
R-407C 
Systems that use R-407C can be designed to match the per-
formance of HCFC-22 systems if appropriate adjustments are 
made, such as changing the size of the heat exchangers. This is 
demonstrated by the availability of R-407C systems in Europe 
and Japan at capacities and efﬁciencies equal to the HCFC-22 
units which they replace. In Europe, R-407C has been predomi-
nantly used as the replacement for HCFC-22 in air-to-air air-
conditioning applications. In Japan, R-407C has primarily been 
used in the larger capacity duct-free and multi-split products.
R-410A 
R-410A is being used to replace HCFC-22 in new products in 
some markets. R-410A air conditioners (up to 140 kW) are cur-
rently available on a commercial basis in the USA, Asia and 
Europe. A signiﬁcant proportion of the duct-free products sold 
in Japan use R-410A. In 2002, approximately 5% of the equip-
ment sold into the US ducted residential market used R-410A. 
It is likely that the US ducted residential market will mainly use 
R-410A as the HCFC-22 replacement.
5.1.2.2 
Hydrocarbons and CO2 
The use of hydrocarbons in air-conditioning applications has 
been limited due to the safety concerns inherent in the applica-
tion of ﬂammable refrigerants. 
 
Propane (HC-290) has mainly been used in portable (facto-
ry sealed) air conditioners. Approximately 90,000 HC-290 por-
table air conditioners are reported to have been sold in Europe 
in 2003. The typical charge quantity used in these units is ap-
proximately 0.10 kg kW-1.
 
To date, CO2 units have been essentially limited to custom 
built applications or demonstration units. A component supply 
base from which to manufacture CO2 systems does not current-
ly exist. 
5.1.3 
Options for reducing HFC emissions
Options for reducing HFC emissions include refrigerant con-
servation in HFC vapour-compression systems and the use of 
non-HFC systems. These options are discussed below.
5.1.3.1 
HFC vapour-compression systems
Residential and commercial air-conditioning and heating units 
are designed to use a speciﬁed charge of a refrigerant, and not 
to emit that refrigerant to the atmosphere during normal opera-
tion. However, refrigerant emissions due to losses can occur as 
a result of several factors: 
• Refrigerant leaks associated with poor design or manufac-

turing quality, such as leaks from valves, joints, piping and 
heat exchangers represent on average 2−5% of the factory 
refrigerant charge per year;
• Leaks in poorly installed ﬁeld-interconnecting tubing, which 
can emit 5−100% of factory charge within the ﬁrst year of 
installation;
• Accidental releases due to mechanical failure or damage of 
equipment components can result in up to 100% loss of the 
system charge;
• Intentional venting of refrigerant during servicing (e.g., 
air purging) or disposing of equipment (in many countries 
this practice is still legal). This type of emission can repre-
sent anywhere from a small percentage to the total system 
charge;
• Losses of refrigerant during equipment disposal (up to 100% 
of the system charge). 
For air conditioners working on the vapour-compression cycle 
and using any refrigerant, there are several practical ways to 
promote refrigerant conservation, and to reduce refrigerant 
emissions. The most signiﬁcant are:
• Improved design and installation of systems to reduce leak-
age and consequently increase refrigerant containment;
• Design to minimize refrigerant charge quantities in sys-
tems;
• Adoption of best practices for installation, maintenance and 
repairing of equipment, including leak detection and re-
pair;
• Refrigerant recovery during servicing;
• Recycling and reclaiming of recovered refrigerant;
• Refrigerant recovery at equipment decommissioning;
• Appropriate government policies to motivate the use of 
good practices and to promote refrigerant conservation.
Standards and good practice guidelines, like ANSI/ASHRAE2 
Standard 147-2002, outline practices and procedures to reduce 
the inadvertent release of halogenated refrigerants from station-
ary refrigeration, air conditioning, and heat pump equipment 
during manufacture, installation, testing, operation, mainte-
nance, repair, and disposal. 
5.1.3.1.1 Developing country aspects
Developing countries face speciﬁc issues with respect to the 
containment and conservation of refrigerants. Since the manu-
facturing process is approaching a global standard, and most 
of the developing countries are importers and not manufactur-
ers of air-conditioning equipment, the speciﬁc issues faced by 
these countries are mostly related to servicing, training of tech-
nicians, legislation and regulations. Important points, in addi-
tion to those mentioned above, are:
• Technician training and awareness are essential to the suc-
cess of refrigerant conservation, especially where preven-
tive maintenance procedures have not been routine in the 
past; 
• Developing countries could devote resources to developing 
a reclamation infrastructure, with the necessary refrigerant 
recovery and reclaiming network, or emphasize on-site re-
frigerant recycling. The Multi-Lateral Fund of the Montreal 
Protocol supports this practice;
• In many developing countries, preventive maintenance of 
air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment has been rare. 
Conservation approaches, which rely heavily on regular 
maintenance, could be successfully implemented if coun-
tries were to provide incentives to encourage routine sched-
uled maintenance (UNEP, 2003).
5.1.3.2 
Non-HFC systems
Non-HFC systems include vapour-compression cycles with re-
frigerants other than HFCs, and alternative cycles and methods 
to produce refrigeration and heating. The four stationary air 
conditioner categories described in Section 5.1.1 have the non-
HFC system options described below.
5.1.3.2.1 Vapour-compression cycle with non-HFC 
refrigerants
Many factors need to be taken into consideration when design-
ing an air-conditioning product with a new refrigerant, for ex-
ample, environmental impact, safety, performance, reliability, 
and market acceptance. Non-HFC refrigerants that are currently 
being investigated and used are now detailed.
Hydrocarbon refrigerants
An extensive literature review on the performance of hydrocar-
bon refrigerants was performed in 2001 (ARTI, 2001). Many 
articles reported that refrigerants such as propane offer similar 
or slightly superior efﬁciency to HCFC-22 in air-conditioning 
systems. Few rigorous comparisons of ﬂuorocarbon and hydro-
carbon systems have been reported. However, the available data 
suggest that efﬁciency increases of about 2−5% were common 
in drop-in ‘soft-optimized’ system tests. In a system speciﬁcally 
optimized for hydrocarbons, it might be possible to achieve ef-
ﬁciency increases somewhat greater than 5% by using propane 
rather than HCFC-22, assuming no other ﬁre safety measures 
need to be taken which would reduce efﬁciency. In certain coun-
tries safety regulations require the use of a secondary loop and 
this signiﬁcantly reduces the efﬁciency of the hydrocarbon sys-
tem and increases its cost compared to the HCFC-22 system. In 
order to offer equipment which meets the market requirements 
for the lowest cost, manufacturers will need to determine how 
the costs of safety improvements required for hydrocarbon sys-
tems compare with the costs required to raise the efﬁciency of 
competing systems. Safety standards are likely to vary around 
the world and this may lead to different choices. Vigorous de-
bates among advocates of hydrocarbon and competing refriger-
ants are likely to continue, due to the differences in perceived

and acceptable risk in different countries. However under the 
appropriate conditions, for example limited charge and sealed 
circuits hydrocarbons can be used safely (ARTI, 2001).
Carbon dioxide 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) offers a number of desirable characteris-
tics as a refrigerant: availability, low-toxicity, low direct GWP 
and low cost. CO2 systems are also likely to be smaller than sys-
tems using other common refrigerants but will not necessarily 
be cheaper (Nekså, 2001). There is a signiﬁcant amount of con-
ﬂicting data concerning the efﬁciency of CO2 in air- condition-
ing applications. Some of the data indicate very low efﬁciencies 
compared to HCFC-22 systems while other references indicate 
parity to better performance. Additional research and develop-
ment will be needed to arrive at a deﬁnitive determination of the 
efﬁciency of CO2 in comfort air-conditioning applications. 
5.1.3.2.2 Alternative technologies to vapour-compression 
cycle
The absorption cycle offers a commercially-available alterna-
tive to the vapour-compression cycle. At least two Japanese 
manufacturers have had commercially-available, split-type 
absorption air conditioners available for about 5 years. One 
Italian manufacturer has also been selling small-scale absorp-
tion units for some commercial installations. It is reported that 
over 360,000 gas-ﬁred absorption units with capacities below 
7.5 kW have been produced in Europe and North America using 
the ammonia-water cycle (Robur, 2004). The performance of a 
direct-ﬁred absorption system will generally result in a higher 
total-equivalent-warming-impact (TEWI) value than for a va-
pour-compression system, unless the regional electrical power 
generation has a high CO2 emission factor.
 
A number of other non-traditional technologies have been 
examined for their potential to reduce consumption and emis-
sion of HFCs. These include desiccant cooling systems, Stirling 
cycle systems, thermoelectrics, thermoacoustics and magnetic 
refrigeration. With the exception of the Stirling cycle and 
desiccants, all of these alternatives suffer such large efﬁcien-
cy penalties that the consequent indirect effects would over-
whelm any direct beneﬁt in emission reduction. In the USA, 
the Stirling cycle has remained limited to niche applications, 
despite the research interest and very substantial funding by the 
US Department of Energy, and has never been commercialized 
for air conditioning. In high latent-load applications, desiccant 
systems have been used to supplement the performance of con-
ventional mechanical air conditioning.
5.1.4 
Global warming effects 
Several factors inﬂuence the emission of greenhouse gases 
associated with residential and commercial air-conditioning 
and heating equipment. These include direct emissions during 
equipment life and at the end of life, refrigerant properties, sys-
tem capacity (size), system efﬁciency, carbon intensity of the 
electrical energy source, and climate. Some of the sensitivities 
are illustrated by the examples in Figures 5.1 to 5.9. In regions 
with cooler climates, where air conditioning is used less often 
or where the electricity generation energy source is not carbon-
intensive, direct emissions can outweigh the indirect effects.
 
Including the life-cycle climate performance (LCCP) as a 
design criterion is one aspect that can minimize the GWP of 
residential and commercial air-conditioning and heating equip-
ment. Factoring LCCP into the design methodology will result 
in an optimum design that is different from one just optimized 
for lowest cost. By optimizing for the best LCCP, the designer 
will also improve on a number of other parameters, for example, 
the  design for energy efﬁciency, the type and amount of refrig-
erant used in the unit (determined by refrigerant cycle design), 
reduced leakage (service valve design, joining technologies, 
manufacturing screening methods, sensor technologies for the 
early detection of refrigerant leaks), and reduced installation 
and service losses (factory sealed refrigerant circuits, robust 
ﬁeld connection technologies, service valves that reduce losses 
during routine service). The investment required to achieve a 
given reduction in LCCP will differ per factor.
5.1.4.1 
LCCP examples for air conditioners
Several examples of LCCP calculation are now given for tech-
nologies typical of those described above (i.e. vapour com-
pression cycle with HCFC and HFC refrigerants), as well as 
technologies that have been studied for their potential to reduce 
greenhouse-gas emissions from air-conditioning applications. 
As stated previously, the results obtained by these studies are 
dependent on the assumptions made (leakage rate, recovery 
rate, use of secondary loop, etc.). Changing these assumptions 
can lead to different results.
 
Figure 5.1 compares LCCP values for 3 tonne (10.5 kW) air-
conditioning and heat pump units operating in Atlanta, Georgia, 
USA. LCCP values are calculated for three efﬁciency levels − 
seasonal energy efﬁciency ratio (SEER) levels of 10, 12, and 14 
Btu Wh-1. By 2010 when HCFC-22 has been phased out for new 
equipment and higher energy efﬁciency standards (13 SEER in 
the US) are in place, an HFC blend refrigerant is likely to rep-
resent a large part of the market for new equipment. The results 
generally show that direct warming impacts due to life-cycle 
refrigerant emissions are less than 5% of the LCCP. The differ-
ence in the indirect warming component of LCCP at different 
efﬁciency levels is much greater. Propane and CO2 emissions 
have a negligible warming impact. However, the possible addi-
tional cost for using propane safely or for achieving a given ef-
ﬁciency level with CO2, exceeds the difference in cost between 
the 12 and 14 SEER performance levels, which have a greater 
impact on LCCP than the direct warming from refrigerant emis-
sions. (Figure 5.1 is based upon annual make-up losses of 2% 
of charge and an end-of-life loss of 15% of charge, electrical 
generation with emissions of 0.65 kg CO2 kWh-1, annual cool-
ing load of 33.8 million Btu and heating load of 34.8 million 
Btu, and a 15-year equipment lifetime) (ADL, 2002).

much greater effect on LCCP than the direct effect of refriger-
ant emissions. (Figure 5.2 is based upon annual make-up loss-
es of 1% of charge and an end-of-life loss of 15% of charge, 
electrical generation with emissions of 0.65 kg CO2 kWh-1, and 
equivalent full load cooling hours of 1400 in Atlanta and 600 in 
Pittsburgh, and a 15-year equipment lifetime) (ADL, 2002).
 
Figure 5.3 presents LCCP values for 4 kW mini-split heat 
pump units in Japan. The chart compares units with 4 different 
refrigerants: CO2, propane (HC-290), R-410A, and HFC-32. 
Other parameters varied in this chart are the assumptions about 
the amount of refrigerant recovered at the end of the equipment 
life (recovery is assumed to be consistent with normal practice 
in Japan; 60% and 70% are analyzed) and the coefﬁcient of 
performance (COP) level of the equipment (standard models 
compared with high COP models – values shown on the chart). 
Equipment life is taken to be 12 years with no refrigerant charge 
added during life, and power generation emissions of 0.378 kg 
CO2 kWh-1 are assumed. The units are assumed to run for 3.6 
months for cooling and 5.5 months for heating according to 
Japanese Standard JRA4046-1999 (JRAIA, 1999). The ﬁgure 
shows that the LCCP for these mini-splits is dominated by the 
COP, which is why CO2 has such a high LCCP. The source for 
the data assumed that a secondary heat transfer loop would be 
required for propane, reducing COP and adding a 10−20% cost 
penalty. The two end-of-life refrigerant recovery rates examined 
have only a secondary effect on LCCP. This is only apparent 
for R-410A, which has the highest GWP of those compared. In 
Japan and many other countries, it is unclear whether HFC-32 
(a ﬂammable refrigerant) in mini-splits would be permitted for 
use in direct expansion or whether it would require a secondary 
loop (work to determine this is still underway including an IEC3 
standard). The LCCP penalty for a secondary loop in the HFC-
32 system is not shown here. This penalty would make HFC-32 
systems less attractive than R-410A. 
 
Figure 5.4 shows LCCP values for 56 kW multi-split air 
conditioners for commercial applications in Japan. The refrig-
erants compared are propane, R-407C, and R-410A with two 
rates of refrigerant recovery at the end of the equipment life, 
50% and 70%. Each system has a COP level shown on the 
chart, which has been obtained by using the variable compres-
sor speed (inverter drive). For comparative purposes, a propane 
system without inverter has been added. The source for the data 
assumed that the propane system would have a secondary heat 
transfer loop. Multi-split air conditioners for commercial ap-
plication units are assumed to operate 1941 h yr-1 for cooling

sumed to be 15 years with no additional charge required during 
the operating life. Power generation emissions are assumed to 
be 0.378 kg CO2 kWh-1 (Onishi et al., 2004). The ﬁgure shows 
that the combination of COP improvements obtained with in-
verter drive plus the lower emissions rate for power generation 
in Japan, mean that the indirect component of LCCP is less im-
portant than in the previous US cases. Also the higher the COP, 
the less important differences in COP are to the overall LCCP. 
This ﬁgure clearly shows the value of achieving a high recovery 
rate of refrigerant at the end of service life.
 
5.1.4.2 
Global refrigerant bank
Table 5.1 estimates the refrigerant banks in 2001 as 548,000 
tonnes of HCFC-22 and 28,000  tonnes of HFCs. Another source 
(Palandre et al., 2004) estimates that in 2002, the stationary AC 
bank consisted of over 1,000,000 tonnes of HCFCs and nearly 
81,000  tonnes of HFCs. Although stationary AC includes more 
than just air-cooled air conditioners and heat pumps, it is clear 
that this type of equipment constitutes a large part of the HCFC 
bank. Emission estimates for stationary air conditioners are 
given in Section 5.4.
5.2 
Chillers 
Comfort air conditioning in large commercial buildings (in-
cluding hotels, ofﬁces, hospitals, universities) is often provided 
by water chillers connected to an air handling and distribution 
system. Chillers cool water or a water/antifreeze mixture which 
is then pumped through a heat exchanger in an air handler or 
fan-coil unit to cool and dehumidify the air.
5.2.1 
Technologies and applications
Two types of water chillers are available, vapour-compression 
chillers and absorption chillers.
 
The principal components of a vapour-compression chiller 
are a compressor driven by an electric motor, a liquid cooler 
(evaporator), a condenser, a refrigerant, a refrigerant expan-
sion device, and a control unit. The refrigerating circuit in 
water chillers is usually factory sealed and tested; the installer 
does not need to connect refrigerant-containing parts on site. 
Therefore leaks during installation and use are minimal. 
 
The energy source for absorption chillers is the heat pro-
vided by steam, hot water, or a fuel burner. In absorption chill-
ers, two heat exchangers (a generator and an absorber) and a 
solution pump replace the compressor and motor of the vapour-

compression cycle. Water is frequently the refrigerant used in 
these systems and the absorbent is lithium bromide. Small ab-
sorption chillers may use an alternative ﬂuid pair: ammonia as 
the refrigerant and water as the absorbent.
 
Vapour-compression chillers are identiﬁed by the type of 
compressor they employ. These are classiﬁed as centrifugal 
compressors or positive displacement compressors. The latter 
category includes reciprocating, screw, and scroll compressors. 
Absorption chillers are identiﬁed by the number of heat input 
levels they employ (i.e., single-stage or two-stage), and whether 
they are direct-ﬁred with a burning fuel, or use steam or hot wa-
ter as the heat energy source. Table 5.2 lists the cooling capacity 
range offered by each type of chiller.
 
For many years, centrifugal chillers were the most com-
mon type of chillers above 700 kW capacity. Reciprocating 
compressors were used in smaller chillers. From the mid-1980s 
onwards, screw compressors became available as alternatives 
to reciprocating compressors in the 140−700 kW range and as 
alternatives to centrifugal compressors in the range up to about 
2275 kW. Scroll compressors were introduced at about the 
same time and have been used as alternatives to reciprocating 
compressors in the 7 to over 90 kW range.
 
The Japan Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration 
News (JARN, 2001) estimates that:
• 
The market for centrifugal and large screw chillers is divid-
ed between 40% in the USA and Canada, 25−30% in Asia, 
and smaller percentages in other regions in the world; 
• 
The market for large absorption chillers is highly concen-
trated in Japan, China, and Korea with the USA and Europe 
as the remaining signiﬁcant markets;
• 
The world market for smaller, positive displacement chill-
ers (with hermetic reciprocating, scroll, and screw compres-
sors) is much larger in absolute terms than for the other 
chiller types.
The coefﬁcient of performance (COP) is one of the key criteria 
used to describe chillers. Other efﬁciency parameters are kW 
tonne-1 (electrical power consumption in relation to cooling ca-
pacity) and energy efﬁciency ratio (EER) or Btu Wh-1 (cooling 
capacity related to power consumption).
 
Each type of chiller and refrigerant combination has a best-
in-class COP level that can be purchased. This COP level tends 
to increase over the years as designs are improved. However, 
the chillers with the best COPs tend to be more expensive as 
they employ larger heat exchangers and other special features. 
In the absence of minimum efﬁciency standards, many purchas-
ers choose to buy lower-cost, lower-COP chillers. 
 
Full-load COP is commonly used as a simple measure of 
chiller efﬁciency. With the increasing recognition of the domi-
nant contribution of the power consumption of chillers to their 
GWP, more attention has been paid to the energy efﬁciency of 
chillers at their more common operating conditions. In a single-
chiller installation, chillers generally operate at their full-load or 
design point conditions less than 1% of the time. Manufacturers 
developed techniques such as variable-speed compressor drives, 
advanced controls, and efﬁcient compressor unloading methods 
to optimize chiller efﬁciency under a wide range of conditions. 
In the US, ARI developed an additional performance measure 
for chillers called the Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV) which 
is described in ARI Standard 550/590 (ARI, 2003). The IPLV 
metric is based on weighting the COP at four operating condi-
tions by the percentage of time assumed to be spent at each of 
four load fractions (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) by an individ-
ual chiller. The IPLV metric takes into account chiller energy-
reducing features which are increasingly becoming common 
practice, but are not reﬂected in the full-load COP. 
 
For a single chiller it is appropriate to use IPLV as the per-
formance parameter, multiplied by actual operating hours when 
calculating the LCCP. For multiple chiller installations, which 
constitute about 80% of all installations, the calculation of 
LCCP includes full load COP and the IPLV based on the actual 
operating hours estimated for each load condition.
 
The ARI IPLV calculation details are based on single chiller 
installations and an average of 29 distinct US climate patterns. 
A modiﬁed version is being considered for Europe (Adnot, 
2002). 
 
Most installations have two or more chillers, so ARI recom-
mends use of a comprehensive analysis that reﬂects the actual 
weather data, building load characteristics, number of chill-
ers, operating hours, economizing capabilities, and energy for 
auxiliaries such as pumps and cooling towers to determine the 
overall chiller-plant system performance (ARI, 1998). 
5.2.2 
Refrigerant use and equipment population
Estimates and data about refrigerant use and equipment popula-
tion, for the different types of chillers are presented below.
5.2.2.1 
Centrifugal chillers
Centrifugal chillers are manufactured in the United States, 
Asia, and Europe. Prior to 1993, these chillers were offered 
with CFC-11, CFC-12, R-500, and HCFC-22 refrigerants. Of 
these, CFC-11 was the most common. With the implementation 
of the Montreal Protocol, production of chillers using CFCs or 
refrigerants containing CFCs (such as R-500) essentially ended 
in 1993. Centrifugal chillers using HCFC-22 rarely were pro-
duced after the late 1990s.

The refrigerant alternatives for CFC-11 and CFC-12 or R-500 
are HCFC-123 and HFC-134a, respectively. These refrigerants 
began to be used in centrifugal chillers in 1993 and continue to 
be used in 2004 in new production chillers.
 
Chillers employing HCFC-123 are available with maximum 
COPs of 7.45 (0.472 kW tonne-1). With additional features such 
as variable-speed drives, HCFC-123 chillers can attain IPLV 
values of up to 11.7. Chillers employing HFC-134a are avail-
able with COPs of 6.79 (0.518 kW tonne-1). With additional 
features such as variable-speed drives, HFC-134a chillers can 
attain IPLV values of up to 11.2. 
 
Table 5.3 shows the range of cooling capacities offered for 
centrifugal chillers with several refrigerants. Table 5.4 shows 
the equipment population in a number of countries. This table 
provides estimates of the refrigerant bank in these chillers, as-
suming an average cooling capacity of 1400 kW in most cas-
es and approximate values for the refrigerant charge for each 
refrigerant. The refrigerant charge for a given cooling capac-
ity may vary with the efﬁciency level of the chiller. For any 
given refrigerant, higher efﬁciency levels often are associated 
with larger heat exchangers and, therefore, larger amounts of 
charge.
 
Production of a new refrigerant, HFC-245fa,  as a foam-
blowing agent commenced in 2003, and it has been considered 
as a candidate for use in new chiller designs. It has operating 
pressures higher than those for HCFC-123 but lower than for 
HFC-134a. Its use requires compressors to be redesigned to 
match its properties, a common requirement for this type of 
compressor. Unlike those for HCFC-123, heat exchangers for 
HFC-245fa must be designed to meet pressure vessel codes. 
Chillers employing HFC-245fa are not available yet. No chiller 
manufacturer has announced plans to use it at this time.
 
Centrifugal chillers are used in naval submarines and sur-
face vessels. These chillers originally employed CFC-114 as 
the refrigerant in units with a capacity of 440−2800 kW. A num-
ber of CFC-114 chillers were converted to use HFC-236fa as a 
transitional refrigerant. New naval chillers use HFC-134a.
5.2.2.2 
Positive displacement chillers
Chillers employing screw, scroll, and reciprocating compressors 
are manufactured in many countries around the world. Water-
cooled chillers are generally associated with cooling towers for 
heat rejection from the system. Air-cooled chillers are equipped 
with refrigerant-to-air ﬁnned-tube condenser coils and fans to 
reject heat from the system. The selection of water-cooled as 
opposed to air-cooled chillers for a particular application varies

with regional conditions and owner preferences.
 
When they were ﬁrst produced in the mid-1980s, screw 
chillers generally employed HCFC-22 as the refrigerant. 
HFC-134a chillers have recently been introduced by a number 
of manufacturers and in some cases these have replaced their 
HCFC-22 products.
 
Screw chillers using a higher pressure refrigerant, R-410A, 
have recently been introduced. Screw chillers using ammonia 
as the refrigerant are available from some manufacturers and 
these are mainly found in northern-European countries. The 
numbers produced are small compared to chillers employing 
HCFC-22 or HFCs. 
 
Air-cooled and water-cooled screw chillers below 700 
kW often employ evaporators with refrigerant ﬂowing inside 
the tubes and chilled water on the shell side. These are called 
direct-expansion (DX) evaporators. Chillers with capacities 
above 700 kW generally employ ﬂooded evaporators with the 
refrigerant on the shell side. Flooded evaporators require higher 
charges than DX evaporators (see Table 5.5), but permit closer 
approach temperatures and higher efﬁciencies. 
Scroll chillers are produced in both water-cooled and air-cooled 
versions using DX evaporators. Refrigerants offered include 
HCFC-22, HFC-134a, R-410A, and R-407C. For capacities be-
low 150 kW, brazed-plate heat exchangers are often used for 
evaporators instead of the shell-and-tube heat exchangers em-
ployed in larger chillers. Brazed-plate heat exchangers reduce 
system volume and refrigerant charge.
 
Air-cooled chiller systems are generally less expensive than 
the equivalent-capacity water-cooled chiller systems that in-
clude a cooling tower and water pump. However, under many 
conditions water-cooled systems can be more efﬁcient due to 
the lower condensing temperatures.
 
Reciprocating chillers are produced in both water-cooled 
and air-cooled versions using DX evaporators. Air-cooled ver-
sions have increased their market share in recent years. Prior 
to the advent of the Montreal Protocol, some of the smaller re-
ciprocating chillers (under 100 kW) were offered with CFC-
12 as the refrigerant. Most of the smaller chillers, and nearly 
all the larger chillers, employed HCFC-22 as the refrigerant. 
Since the Montreal Protocol, new reciprocating chillers have 
employed HCFC-22, R-407C, and to a small extent, HFC-134a 
and propane or propylene. Some water-cooled reciprocating 
chillers were manufactured with ammonia as the refrigerant but 
the number of these units is very small compared to the number 
of chillers employing ﬂuorocarbon refrigerants. As with scroll 
chillers, the use of brazed-plate heat exchangers reduces the 
system volume and system charge.
 
Table 5.5 shows approximate charge levels for each type of 
positive displacement chiller with several refrigerants. 
 
The refrigerant blend R-407C is being used as a transitional 
replacement for HCFC-22 in direct expansion (DX) systems 
because it has a similar cooling capacity and pressure levels. 
However, R-407C necessitates larger and more expensive 
heat exchangers to maintain its performance. For R-407C DX 
evaporators, some of this difﬁculty is offset in new equipment 
by taking advantage of the refrigerant’s ‘glide’ characteristic 
(‘glide’ of about 5oC temperature variation during constant-
pressure evaporation) in counter-ﬂow heat exchange. The glide 
also can be accommodated in the conventional condensers of 
air-cooled chillers. In time, the higher-pressure blend, R-410A, 
is expected to replace the use of R-407C, particularly in smaller 
chillers (UNEP, 2003). 
5.2.2.3 
Absorption chillers
Absorption chillers are mainly manufactured in Japan, China, 
and South Korea. A few absorption chillers are manufactured in 
North America. Absorption chiller energy use can be compared 
to electrical chiller energy by using calculations based on pri-
mary energy. Absorption systems have higher primary energy 
requirements and higher initial costs than vapour-compres-
sion chillers. They can be cost-effective in applications where 
waste heat is available in the form of steam or hot water, where 
electricity is not readily available for summer cooling loads, 
or where high electricity cost structures (including demand 
charges) make gas-ﬁred absorption a lower-cost alternative. In 
Japan, government policy encourages absorption systems so as 
to facilitative a more balanced gas import throughout the year 
and to reduce summer electrical loads.
 
Single-stage absorption applications are typically limited to 
sites that can use waste heat in the form of hot water or steam 
as the energy source. Such sites include cogeneration systems 
where waste engine heat or steam is available. Two-stage ab-
sorption chillers, driven by steam or hot water or directly ﬁred 
by fossil fuels, were ﬁrst produced in large numbers in Asia 
(primarily in Japan) for the regional market during the 1980s. 
Two-stage chillers were produced in North America shortly af-
terwards, often through licensing from the Asian manufacturers.

below 90 kW are produced in Europe and North America using 
ammonia as the refrigerant and water as the absorbent. 
5.2.2.4 
World market characteristics
Table 5.6 summarizes the market for chillers in 2001. It shows 
that air-cooled positive displacement chillers represented nearly 
75% of the number of units in the positive displacement catego-
ry. Chillers larger than 100 kW are dominant in the Americas, 
the Middle East, and southern Asia while smaller air-cooled 
chillers and chiller heat pumps for residential and light com-
mercial use are more common in East Asia and Europe.
 
In a number of countries the commercial air-conditioning 
market appears to be moving away from small chillers toward 
ductless single-package air conditioners or ducted unitary sys-
tems, due to the lower installation cost (JARN, 2002a). 
 
Market conditions in China are particularly interesting due 
to the recent rapid development of its internal market, chiller 
manufacturing capabilities, and export potential. The centrifugal 
chiller population in China is included in Table 5.4. Signiﬁcant 
growth began in the 1990s. Before 1995, most centrifugals were 
imported. After 1995, increasing numbers of chillers were pro-
duced in China by factories using US designs (primarily HCFC-
123 (30%) and HFC-134a (70%)) (ICF, 2003). For chillers of all 
types, China is now the largest market in the world with sales of 
34,000 units in 2001 and a growth of over 8.5% yr-1. The main 
market is East China where there is a growing replacement mar-
ket. Over half of all chiller sales are now reversible heat pumps 
that can provide cooling and heating. Screw and scroll chiller 
sales, mostly using HCFC-22, are rising as their technology be-
comes more familiar to the major design institutes. Demand for 
absorption chillers has been slowing since 1999 when national 
energy policy changed to relax controls on electricity for com-
mercial businesses. China has a major residential market for 
chillers with fan coil units (BSRIA, 2001). 
5.2.3 
Options for HFC emissions reduction
As with stationary air conditioners, options for reducing HFC 
emissions in chillers include refrigerant conservation as de-
scribed in Section 5.1.3.1 and the use of non-HFC systems. 
These options are now detailed. 
5.2.3.1 
HFC vapour-compression systems
Over the past 30 years, the life-cycle refrigerant needs of chill-
ers have been reduced more than tenfold (Calm, 1999) due to 
design improvements and, in particular, the improved care of 
equipment in the ﬁeld. The approaches that have been used to 
reduce CFC emissions over the last 30 years can also be applied 
to HCFCs and HFCs.
 
The starting points for reducing HFC emissions from chill-
ers were designing the chiller and its components to use a re-
duced amount of refrigerant charge, employing a minimum 
number of ﬁttings that are potential leakage sources, avoiding 
the use of ﬂare ﬁttings on tubing, and including features that 
minimize emissions while servicing components such as shut-
off valves for oil ﬁlters and sensors. Many manufacturers have 
already implemented such changes. 
 
Service technicians can be trained and certiﬁed to perform 
their tasks while minimizing refrigerant emissions during in-
stallation and refrigerant charging, servicing, and ultimately 
taking equipment out of service. Charging and storing the re-
frigerant in the chiller at the factory prior to delivery can re-
duce emissions at installation. Refrigerant should be recovered 
at the end of equipment life. Appropriate government policies 
can be effective in accomplishing these objectives. Some coun-
tries require annual inspections of equipment or monitoring of 
refrigerant use to determine whether emissions are becoming 
excessive and require action if this is the case.
 
Remote monitoring is becoming an established method for 
monitoring the performance of chillers. It is also being used 
to detect leakage either directly through leak detectors or in-
directly through changes in system characteristics (e.g., pres-
sures). Remote monitoring can provide alerts to maintenance 
engineers and system managers so as to ensure that early action 
is taken to repair leaks and maintain performance.

Non-HFC systems
5.2.3.2.1 Vapour-compression cycle with non-HFC 
refrigerants
5.2.3.2.1.1   Positive displacement chillers 
The non-HFC refrigerants that have been used in positive dis-
placement compressor chillers are presented below.
Ammonia
Chillers using ammonia as the refrigerant are available in the 
capacity range 100−2000 kW and a few are larger than this. The 
use of ammonia is more complex than that of many other refrig-
erants because ammonia is a strong irritant gas that is slightly 
toxic, corrosive to skin and other membranes, and ﬂammable. 
Recommended practice (ASHRAE, 2001a; ISO, 1993; CEN, 
2000/2001) limits the use of large ammonia systems in public 
buildings to those systems, which use a secondary heat trans-
fer ﬂuid (which is intrinsic in chillers), so that the ammonia is 
conﬁned to the machine room where alarms, venting devices, 
and perhaps scrubber systems can enhance safety. Guidelines 
are available for the safe design and application of ammonia 
systems (IEA, 1998, Chapter 4; ASHRAE, 2001a). Modern, 
compact factory-built units contain the ammonia far more ef-
fectively than old ammonia plants.
 
The high discharge temperatures associated with ammonia 
permit a far greater degree of heat recovery than with other re-
frigerants. 
 
The wider acceptance of ammonia requires public ofﬁcials 
being satisﬁed that ammonia systems are safe under emergency 
conditions such as building ﬁres or earthquakes, either of which 
might rupture refrigerant piping and pressure vessels. The most 
important factor is the establishment of building codes that are 
acceptable to safety ofﬁcials (e.g., ﬁre ofﬁcers). 
Hydrocarbons
Hydrocarbon refrigerants have a long history of application in 
industrial chillers in petrochemical plants. Before 1997 they 
were not used in comfort air-conditioning chiller applications 
due to reservations about the system safety. European manu-
facturers now offer a range of hydrocarbon chillers. About 100 
to 150 hydrocarbon chiller units are sold each year, mainly in 
northern Europe (UNEP, 2003). This is a small number com-
pared to the market for more than 78,000 HCFC and HFC chill-
ers in Europe (Table 5.6). The major markets have been ofﬁce 
buildings, process cooling, and supermarkets. 
 
In a system optimized for hydrocarbons, one might be able to 
achieve efﬁciency increases of more than 5% by using propane 
instead of HCFC-22. In the literature, efﬁciency comparisons 
for HCFC, HFC, and HC systems sometimes show substantial 
differences but do not represent rigorous comparisons. This is-
sue was discussed in Section 5.1.3.2.1. The cost of HC chillers 
is higher than that of HCFC or HFC equivalents, partly due to 
the fact that hydrocarbon chillers still are a niche market.
 
A major disadvantage of hydrocarbons is their ﬂammabil-
ity, which deters their consideration for use in many applica-
tions. Refrigeration safety standards have been developed for 
hydrocarbon systems, for example, IEC 60355-2-40, AMD. 2 
ED. 4, ‘Safety of Household and Similar Electrical Appliances, 
Part 2’. Typical safety measures include proper placement and/
or gas tight enclosure of the chiller, application of low-charge 
system design, fail-safe ventilation systems, and gas detector 
alarm activating systems. An alternative is outdoor installation 
(ARTI, 2001). Comprehensive guidelines for safe design, in-
stallation, and handling of hydrocarbon refrigerants have been 
produced (ACRIB, 2001). These guidelines limit the charge for 
domestic/public applications to <1.5 kg for a sealed system or 
<5 kg in a special machinery room or outdoors. For commercial 
and private applications the limits are <2.5 kg and <10 kg re-
spectively.
Carbon dioxide
Carbon dioxide is being investigated for a wide range of po-
tential applications. However, CO2 does not match the cycle 
energy efﬁciencies of ﬂuorocarbon refrigerants for typical wa-
ter chilling applications (ASHRAE, 2001b). Therefore, there is 
usually no environmental incentive to use CO2 in chillers in-
stead of HFCs. In Japan, CO2 has not been used in a chiller on a 
commercial basis, but one demonstration unit has been built. 
5.2.3.2.1.2   Centrifugal chillers 
The non-HFC refrigerants that have been used in centrifugal 
compressor chillers are discussed below.
Hydrocarbons 
Hydrocarbon refrigerants are used in centrifugal chillers in pet-
rochemical plants where a variety of hazardous materials are 
routinely used and where the staff are highly trained in safety 
measures and emergency responses. Hydrocarbon refrigerants 
have not been used elsewhere due to concerns about system 
safety due to the large charges of ﬂammable refrigerants. 
Ammonia 
Ammonia is not a suitable refrigerant for centrifugal chill-
ers due to the large number of compressor stages required to 
produce the necessary pressure rise (‘head’) for the ammonia 
chiller cycle. 
Water 
Water is a very low-pressure refrigerant, with a condensing 
pressure of 4.2 kPa (0.042 bar) at 30°C and a suction pressure 
of 1.6 kPa (0.016 bar) at 9oC. Traditionally, water has been used 
in specialized applications with steam aspirators, and rarely 
with vapour compressors. The low pressures and very high 
volumetric ﬂow rates required in water vapour-compression 
systems necessitate compressor designs that are uncommon in 
the air-conditioning ﬁeld.
 
The few applications that use water as a refrigerant, use it to 
chill water or produce an ice slurry by direct evaporation from a 
pool of water. These systems carry a cost premium of more than

50% above conventional systems. The higher costs are inherent 
and are associated with the large physical size of water vapour 
chillers and the complexity of their compressor technology. 
 
Recent studies indicate that there are no known compressor 
dsigns or cycle conﬁgurations of any cost that will enable water 
vapour-compression cycles to reach efﬁciencies comparable to 
existing technology (ARTI, 2000; ARTI, 2004).
5.2.3.2.2 Alternative technologies to vapour-compression  
 
cycle
Absorption Chillers
Absorption chillers are inherently larger and more expensive 
than vapour-compression chillers. They have been successful in 
speciﬁc markets as described in Section 5.2.2.3. 
 
Some countries have implemented the use of water-LiBr 
absorption chillers in trigeneration systems. Trigeneration is 
the concept of deriving three different forms of energy from 
the primary energy source, namely, heating, cooling and power 
generation. This is also referred to as CHCP (combined heat-
ing, cooling, and power generation). This option is particularly 
relevant in tropical countries where buildings need to be air-
conditioned and many industries require process cooling and 
heating. Although cooling can be provided by conventional va-
pour-compression chillers driven by electricity, heat exhausted 
from the cogeneration plant can drive the absorption chillers so 
that the overall primary energy consumption is reduced. 
5.2.4 
Global warming effects 
5.2.4.1 
LCCP examples for chillers
Figure 5.5 presents LCCP values for chiller technology alter-
natives at 350 tonnes rated capacity (1230 kW) applied to a 
typical ofﬁce building in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. LCCP values 
for centrifugal and screw chillers fall within a +8% range and 
refrigerant emissions account for less than 3% of the LCCP of 
any of these technology options. Ammonia has been included 
as a technical option, but local codes may affect its use. The 
data source did not calculate LCCP for a hydrocarbon system. 
However, hydrocarbon refrigerants have not been used in cen-
trifugal chillers in ofﬁce buildings due to concerns about safety 
with large charges of ﬂammable refrigerants (UNEP, 2003).
 
The major portion of LCCP is the indirect warming associ-
ated with energy consumption. Direct warming due to refriger-
ant emissions only amounts to between 0.2 and 3.0% of the 
total LCCP. The LCCP values of the vapour-compression alter-
natives fall within a reasonably narrow range and show the clear 
superiority of vapour compression over absorption in terms of 
LCCP.
 
The LCCP of a typical direct-ﬁred, two-stage water-LiBr 
absorption chiller is about 65% higher than the average LCCP 
for vapour-compression cycle chillers. 
 
The basic assumptions used to create Figure 5.5 include 
2125 annual operating hours, 30-year equipment life, 0.65 kg 
CO2 kWh-1 power plant emissions, and inclusion of cooling 
tower fan and pump power. The annual charge loss rates are 
assumed to be 1% yr-1 for the vapour-compression chillers to 
account for some end-of-life losses and accidental losses in the 
ﬁeld (ADL, 2002).

cies are shown because many chillers are still operating with 
these refrigerants. The ﬁgure shows the environmental beneﬁts 
obtained by replacing CFC chillers with chillers employing 
non-CFC refrigerants that have higher COPs and a lower direct 
warming impact. In practice, the environmental beneﬁts from 
replacement are greater because older CFC chillers are likely to 
have refrigerant leak rates of 4% or more, which is higher than 
the 1% rate assumed in this ﬁgure.
 
Figure 5.7 shows the effect on TEWI for chillers in Figure 
5.6, if the annual refrigerant make-up rate is doubled to 2% for 
the chillers and the end-of-life refrigerant loss is 5%. The im-
pact of the increased loss rate on TEWI is small, especially for 
the non-CFC chillers. 
 
The leakage rates of 1% and 2% used in Figures 5.6 and 
5.7 are lower than the historical average for chillers, but 2 to 4 
times the best-practice value of 0.5% per year available today 
in the leading centrifugal and screw chillers.
 
The basic assumptions for Figures 5.6 and 5.7 are the same 
as for Figure 5.5 with the exception of the increased cooling ca-
pacity, the CFC chiller characteristics mentioned above, and the 
additional assumption of a 5% loss of charge when the chiller is 
scrapped.
 
Figure 5.8 compares LCCP values for air-cooled 25 kW 
scroll chiller/heat pumps in Japan. Two refrigerants, propane 
and R-407C, are compared for these chiller/heat pumps with 
two levels of end-of-life refrigerant recovery, 50% and 70%. 
The units are assumed to operate 700 h yr-1 for cooling and 400 
h yr-1 for heating No additional charge has been added during 
the 15-year life of the chiller, and the emissions from power 
generation are taken to be 0.378 kg CO2 kWh-1 for Japan (Onishi 
et al., 2004). The ﬁgure shows that the indirect component of 
LCCP is dominant for this application but the effect of only 
50% end-of-life recovery is not negligible. In this comparison, 
the propane system is not equipped with a secondary heat trans-
fer loop with its added COP penalties. This is because chillers 
and chiller/heat pumps inherently contain secondary loops in 
their water-to-water or air-to-water systems. However, propane 
chiller/heat pumps will have a 10−20% cost increase for safety 
features compared to a system with a non-ﬂammable refriger-
ant and the same COP. For the same 10−20% cost increase, an 
increase in COP from 2.65−3.05 should be achievable for the 
R-407C system. This makes the LCCP with R-407C lower than 
that of an equivalent-cost propane system (Onishi et al., 2004).
 
Figure 5.9 shows LCCP values for 355 kW air-cooled screw 
chillers in Japan using propane, HFC-134a, or R-407C as re-
frigerants in systems with several levels of COP. The chiller life 
is assumed to be 25 years with end-of-life refrigerant recovery 
assumed to be either 70% or 80%. Also, during the life of the 
equipment it is assumed that a 10% additional charge is needed 
to compensate for emissions. The units are assumed to operate 
700 h yr-1 for cooling and 400 hours yr-1 for heating. Emissions 
from power generation are assumed to be 0.378 kg CO2 kWh-1 
for Japan (Onishi et al., 2004). The ﬁgure shows that the indi-
rect component of LCCP is dominant for this application and 
end-of-life refrigerant recovery rate. A comparison of the LCCP 
values for the propane and HFC-134a air-cooled screw chiller/
heat pumps reveals that only a modest increase in COP is re-
quired for the HFC-134a system to have a better LCCP than 
propane. This COP increase with HFC-134a could be achieved 
by investing the cost of safety features for ﬂammable refriger-
ant systems in performance improvements to the HFC systems 
instead (Onishi et al., 2004).

5.2.4.2 
Global refrigerant bank and emissions
Table 5.4 provides a sample of the large and varying refrigerant 
bank in chillers. One source (Palandre et al., 2004) estimates 
the  Stationary AC banks in 2002 to be nearly 84,000 tonnes 
CFCs and nearly 81,000 tonnes of HFCs. Although Stationary 
AC includes more than just chillers, it is clear that the CFC-11 
and CFC-12 banks in chillers make up nearly the entire CFC 
bank estimated. The growing use of HFC-134a in chillers con-
tributes substantially to the HFC bank as well. 
 
Table 5.7 shows estimates of global HFC consumption and 
emission for chillers in 2000 and 2010. These estimates are 
based on information from IPCC (IPCC, 2001). Additional in-
formation on emission estimates is provided in Section 5.4.
5.3 
Water-heating heat pumps 
This section describes equipment and refrigerants for heating 
water with heat pumps4.
5.3.1 
Technologies and applications
5.3.1.1 
Vapour-compression cycle, heat-pump water heaters
Almost all heat pumps work on the principle of the vapour-
compression cycle. Heating-only, space-heating heat pumps are 
manufactured in a variety of sizes ranging from 1 kW heating 
capacity for single room units, to 50−1000 kW for commer-
cial/institutional applications, and tens of MW for district heat-
ing plants. Most small to medium-sized capacity heat pumps in 
buildings are standardized factory-made units. Large heat pump 
installations usually are custom-made and are assembled at the 
site.
 
In several countries water heating for swimming pools is 
provided by heat pumps. This is a growing market for heat 
pumps.
 
Heat sources include outdoor, exhaust and ventilation air, 
sea and lake water, sewage water, ground water, earth, industrial 
wastewater and process waste heat. Air-source and ground-cou-
pled heat pumps dominate the market. For environmental rea-
sons, many countries discourage the use of ground water from 
wells as a heat pump source (ground subsidence, higher-value 
uses for well water). In countries with cold climates such as in 
northern Europe, some heat pumps are used for heating only. 
In countries with warmer climates, heat pumps serve hydronic 
systems with fan coils provide heat in the winter and cooling in 
the summer. Heat pumps with dual functions, such as heating 
water and cooling air simultaneously, are also available.
 
In mature markets, such as Sweden, heat pumps have a sig-
niﬁcant market share as heating systems for new buildings and 
are entering into retroﬁt markets as well. In Europe, comfort 
heating dominates heat pump markets − mostly with hydronic 
systems using outside air or the ground. There is increasing use 
of heat pumps that recover a portion of exhaust heat in ventila-
tion air to heat incoming air in balanced systems. This reduces 
the thermal load compared to having to heat the incoming air 
with primary fuel or electricity. Heat pumps in Germany and 
Sweden provide up to 85% of the annual heating in some build-
ings. For these buildings, supplementary heat is required only 
on the coldest days. 
 
Heat pumps have up to a 95% share of heating systems in 
new buildings in Sweden. This is due to the initial development 
support and subsidies from the government that made the units 
reliable and popular, high electricity and gas prices, widespread 
use of hydronic heating systems, and rating as a ‘green’ heating 
system by consumers (IEA, 2003a).

hot-water heating are used in some European countries. Most 
of the combined systems on the market alternate between space 
and water heating, but units simultaneously serving both uses 
are being introduced (IEA, 2004).
 
The heat pumps for comfort heating have capacities up to 
25 kW. Supply temperatures are 35−45oC for comfort heat in 
new constructions and 55o−65oC for retroﬁts. Regulations in a 
number of European countries require domestic water heaters 
to produce supply temperatures of 60−65oC.
 
Small capacity (10−30 kW) air-to-water heat pump chillers 
for residential and light commercial use in combination with 
fan-coil units are popular in China as well as Italy, Spain, and 
other southern-European countries. Hot water delivery tem-
peratures are in the 45−55oC range. In the future, the market 
growth of small air-to-water heat pumps may be slowed in 
some markets by the growing popularity of variable-refriger-
ant-ﬂow systems combined with multiple, indoor fan coil units 
connected to a refrigerant loop for direct refrigerant-to-air heat 
transfer.
 
In Japan, heat pump chillers are mainly for commercial ap-
plications above 70 kW. Commercial size heat pump chillers 
of up to 700 or 1000 kW capacity are used for retroﬁt, replac-
ing old chillers and boilers to vacate machine room space and 
eliminate cooling towers (JARN, 2002b). 
 
Night-time electricity rates in Japan are only 25% of daytime 
rates. As a consequence, domestic hot-water heat pumps are a 
rapidly-growing market. They are operated only at night and 
the hot water is stored for daytime use. Germany and Austria 
have been installing dedicated domestic hot water (DHW) heat 
pumps for a number of years (IEA, 2004).
 
5.3.1.2 
Absorption heat pumps
Absorption heat pumps for space heating are mostly gas-ﬁred 
and commonly provide cooling simultaneously with heat-
ing. Most of the systems use water and lithium bromide as the 
working pair, and can achieve about 100oC output temperature. 
Absorption heat pumps for the heating of residential buildings 
are rare. In industry, absorption heat pumps are only employed 
on a minor scale.
5.3.2 
Refrigerant use and equipment population 
In the past, the most common refrigerants for vapour-compres-
sion heat pumps were CFC-12, R-502, HCFC-22, and R-500. In 
developed countries, HCFC-22 still is used as one of the main 
refrigerants in heat pumps, but manufacturers have begun to 
introduce models using HFC alternatives (HFC-134a, R-407C, 
R-404A) or hydrocarbons to replace their HCFC-22 models. 
 
Data on the installed base of water-heating heat pumps are 
not readily available for most countries. In particular, the data 
needed to estimate the bank of various refrigerants in use in 
these heat pumps do not seem to exist. Global sales of these 
heat pumps were small until 1995, but have increased steadily 
since. The installed base of ground-source heat pumps was esti-
mated to be about 110,000 units in 1998 (IEA, 1999).
Total sales of water-heating heat pumps in Sweden were close 
to 40,000 units in 2002. Of these, 60% used water or brine as a 
source, and the rest used air or exhaust air. Fifty percent of these 
heat pump sales are for retroﬁts. The Swedish Energy Agency 
estimates that over 300,000 heat pumps are in operation there, a 
small portion of which are ‘air-to-air’ (IEA, 2003b).
 
In the rest of Europe, heat pumps are primarily used in new 
construction and provide combined operation − comfort heat-
ing and DHW heating.
 
Switzerland had heat pump sales of 7500 units in 2002, of 
which 50% were air-to-water and 43% were brine-to-water. 
Heat pump sales in Germany were 12,500 units in 2002, of 
which 43% were ground-source combined heat pumps and 33% 
were for DHW heating only (JARN, 2004a). 
 
In China, the use of heat pumps is rapidly increasing and 
had reached 35,000 units in 2002. Sales have increased as a 
result of nationwide housing development projects where the 
preference is for hydronic systems. More than half of the sales 
volume is for units with a capacity of less than 30 kW (JARN, 
2003). 
5.3.3 
Options for reducing HFC emissions
5.3.3.1 
HFC vapour-compression systems
The actions described in Section 5.1.3.1 can also be used to 
reduce emissions in heat pumps.
5.3.3.2 
Vapour-compression cycle with non-HFC 
refrigerants
Hydrocarbons
In most applications HC-290 will yield an energy efﬁciency 
comparable to or slightly higher (e.g., 5−10% higher) than that 
of HCFC-22. The performance difference increases in heat 
pumps at lower ambient temperatures. When designing new 
heat pump systems with propane or other ﬂammable refriger-
ants, adequate safety precautions must be taken to ensure safe 
operation and maintenance. Several standards that regulate the 
use of hydrocarbons in heat pumps exist or are being devel-
oped in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. An example is 
European Standard EN 378 (CEN, 2000/2001).
 
In some countries hydrocarbons are considered to be a via-
ble option in small, low-charge residential heat pumps. Several 
northern-European manufacturers are using propane (HC-290) 
or propylene (HC-1270) as refrigerants in small residential and 
commercial water-to-water and air-to-water heat pumps. The 
hydrocarbon circuit is located outdoors using ambient air, earth, 
or ground water sources, and is connected to hydronic ﬂoor 
heating systems (IEA, 2002).
Carbon Dioxide
The transcritical CO2 cycle exhibits a signiﬁcant temperature 
glide on the high temperature side. Such a glide can be advanta-
geous in a counter-ﬂow heat exchanger. Heat pumps generat-
ing water temperatures of 90oC have been developed in Japan

for home use. Typical heating capacities are 4.5 kW. The COP 
achieved by CO2 water-heating heat pumps is 4.0 and is slightly 
higher for ‘mild climates’. This COP also is attained by R-410A 
heat pumps, but the highest water temperature available is about 
80oC (JARN, 2004b).
 
Carbon dioxide is being introduced as a refrigerant for heat 
pumps, particularly those with a DHW function. Japan and 
Norway have been leaders in the development of CO2 water-heat-
ing heat pumps. Because there is government support in Japan 
for the introduction of high-efﬁciency water heaters, 37,000 heat 
pump water heaters were sold in Japan in 2002 that used CO2 or 
R-410A as refrigerants. The sales are estimated to have increased 
to 75,000−78,000 units in FY 2003 (JARN, 2004b).
Ammonia
Ammonia has been used in medium-sized and large capacity 
heat pumps, mainly in Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, and 
the Netherlands (IEA, 1993, 1994, 1998 (Chapter 4); Kruse, 
1993). System safety requirements for ammonia heat pumps are 
similar to those for ammonia chillers, which were discussed in 
Section 5.2.
5.3.4 
Global warming effects
There are no known published data on the global warming ef-
fects of water heating heat pumps.
5.4 
Estimates for refrigerant emissions and costs for 
emission reductions
There are many data sources that can be used to estimate dis-
crete equipment inventories and refrigerant banks (e.g., ICF, 
2003; JARN, 2002b, and JARN, 2002c). Several studies have 
used these data along with ‘bottom-up’ methodologies to esti-
mate refrigerant banks and/or refrigerant emissions, for past, 
current and/or future years, and for various countries, regions 
or the world.
 
These studies point to the dynamic and competitive nature 
of the air-conditioning market, especially as the transitions from 
CFCs and HCFCs to HFCs and other refrigerants, as described 
earlier in this chapter, occur. Therefore due consideration must 
be given to the data used, the assumptions made, and the meth-
odologies employed in estimating refrigerant banks and emis-
sions. The differences that arise for current estimates of banks 
and emissions are large, and are often further exacerbated when 
projecting future banks and emissions. Some of the aspects that 
may vary from study to study are:
• Equipment Inventories. What type of equipment is includ-
ed? How is it disaggregated?
• Refrigerant Charge. What is the average refrigerant charge? 
Are different charges used for different types or different 
vintages of equipment?
• Emission Sources. Are various emissions sources (e.g., in-
stallation, operating, servicing, end-of-life disposal) evalu-
ated separately, or is an average emission rate used?
• Equipment Lifetimes. How long is equipment assumed to 
exist? Are emission rates assumed to be constant over the 
lifetime?
• Emissions Scope. Are all refrigerants included, or just those 
reported in national inventories under the UNFCCC (i.e., 
HFCs and PFCs)? Does the source also estimate indirect 
emissions from power generation?
• Geographical Extrapolation. If data are only available for 
a particular region, how are the data extrapolated to other 
countries or regions or disaggregated into individual coun-
tries within the region?
• Temporal Extrapolation. How are data extrapolated into the 
future? Do emission rates or refrigerant charges change in 
the future? If so, by how much and on what basis?
• Global Warming Potentials. What source is used for GWPs? 
If CFCs and HCFCs are included in estimates, do GWPs 
represent the direct effect or include the indirect effect as 
well?
Table 5.8 compiles several estimates for recent (1996−2005) 
emission rates. The data shown are direct emissions only. 
Estimates for residential and commercial air conditioning and 
heating (also called ‘stationary air conditioning and heating’) 
are sometimes divided into subcategories. For instance, some 
studies report separate estimates for air conditioners (for cool-
ing and/or heating) and chillers, as described in Sections 5.1 
and 5.2, respectively. No studies were found that contained 
separate emissions of water-heating heat pumps as described 
in Section 5.3.
 
Table 5.8 mostly shows estimates for the entire world, with 
two examples for industrialized Europe to further highlight the 
differences in the literature. Estimates for the entire air condi-
tioning and refrigeration sector are included to provide a per-
spective; see Chapter 4 and Chapter 6 for more information on 
Refrigeration and Mobile Air Conditioning.
 
It is clear that different sources provide vastly different 
emission estimates. Similar differences are seen for refrigerant 
banks. Some of the differences shown above can be explained 
by the transition from ODS to non-ODS refrigerants (e.g., in 
1996 relatively few HFC units existed, whereas by 2005 sub-
stantially more HFC units had been installed). However, the 
major difference in the estimates is due to the data and method-
ologies used.
 
Table 5.9 provides some example estimates of future emis-
sions under ‘baseline’ or ‘business-as-usual’ conditions, in 2010 
and 2015. Again, the data is for direct emissions only. The data 
for 2010 are mainly included to show that any given source 
is not always consistently higher or lower than another source 
(e.g., compare estimates from sources Harnisch et al., 2001, 
and US EPA, 2004).
 
Some authors also examine various options for reducing the 
predicted emissions and the costs associated with this. As with 
the emission estimates, there is a lot of variation between the 
sources and the results are heavily inﬂuenced by the assump-
tions made. The economic factors used, such as the monetary

unit (USD, EUR, etc.) and discount rates, also vary. Table 5.10 
tabulates several examples of abatement options. Only one 
source was found to estimate the effectiveness of energy ef-
ﬁciency improvements. This indicates the conﬁdential nature 
of any such data. When these savings were included in the cal-
culations this option proved to be by far the most cost-effective. 
The remaining options concentrate on other items highlighted 
earlier in this chapter (e.g., recovery, alternative refrigerants). 
Many of these options are assumed to partially exist in the base-
line (e.g., recovery occurs to some extent) and are assumed to 
increase if the option is applied. Note that some costs are nega-
tive, indicating that energy-efﬁciency improvements or lower 
refrigerant costs render the option cost effective under the as-
sumptions applied.
A few of the studies assume certain market penetration, beyond 
that assumed in the baseline, of the aforementioned abatement 
options and predict mitigated emissions under various scenar-
ios. These estimates (again, only direct refrigerant emissions) 
along with the cost-effectiveness of the mitigation option are 
shown in Table 5.11. Note that the cost-effectiveness of the 
mitigation option is shown as ‘@ ###’ per tonne CO2-eq, where 
### is the cost using the monetary unit and discount rate shown 
in Table 5.10.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Mobile air-conditioning (MAC) systems have been mass-pro-
duced in the USA since the early 1960s and in Japan since the 
1970s. However, the numbers of air-conditioned cars in both 
Europe and developing countries only started to signiﬁcantly 
increase much later, in about 1995.
 
The rapid switch from CFC-12 to HFC-134a was a global 
decision taken by all car manufacturers in developed countries. 
The ﬁrst HFC-134a system was installed in 1990 and by 1994 
almost all vehicles including cars, light commercial vehicles, 
and truck cabins,  sold in developed countries used this refrig-
erant. In developing countries the transition from CFC-12 to 
HFC-134a will be completed in 2008. Since 1990, signiﬁcant 
progress has been made in limiting refrigerant emissions and 
the implementation of the Montreal Protocol has contributed 
to this. For example, recovery equipment has been developed, 
some countries have encouraged the intensive training of ser-
vice technicians to improve servicing practices, component 
manufacturers have designed low-emission components (ﬁt-
tings, hoses, etc.) and car manufacturers have usually lowered 
the original refrigerant charge. These efforts led to a signiﬁcant 
decrease in emission levels from about 400 g yr-1 in the late 
1980s to about 200 g yr-1 in the mid-1990s (UNEP, 1998) and 
efforts are still underway to further reduce these emission levels 
to 100 g yr-1 or less (Schwarz and Harnisch, 2003).
 
If all types of refrigerants are considered, emissions from 
MAC systems range from approximately 105,000 tonnes of 
CFC-12 in 1990 to 137,000 tonnes of CFC-12 and HFC-134a in 
2003, with CFC-12 still representing 46% of those emissions. 
A business-as-usual scenario forecasts emissions in the range of 
180,000 tonnes in 2015 (see Figure 6a), most of which will be 
HFC-134a.  The CO2-eq emissions fell from about 850 MtCO2-
eq in 1990 to 609 Mtonnes CO2-eq in 2003 (see Figure 6b) and 
a business-as-usual scenario forecasts CO2-eq emissions in the 
range of 270 Mtonnes CO2-eq in 2015. The progressive phase 
out of CFC-12 in the ﬂeet and its replacement by HFC-134a has 
led to a signiﬁcant decrease in CO2-eq. emissions, despite the 
continued growth of the MAC system ﬂeet.
 
CFC-12 was not widely used within the EU due to the very 
low number of air-conditioned cars before 1995. However, there 
have been increasing concerns about the signiﬁcant increase of 
HFC-134a use in Europe. In its Fluorinated Gas regulation proj-
ect, the European Commission has proposed the phase-out of 
HFC-134a, thereby creating a totally new context for refriger-
ant choices.
 
Evaluating the additional fuel consumption of MAC system 
operation is a complex task. Nevertheless, initial evaluations 
indicate that in 2003, CO2 emission due to global MAC opera-
tion was in the order of 100 Mtonnes.
Options for greenhouse gas emission mitigation
There are three main options for reducing greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions: Improving the current HFC-134a system or 
switching to other low global warming potential (GWP) refrig-
erants such as HFC-152a or CO2. Other options such as hy-
drocarbons (HCs) have been investigated but car manufacturers 
did not support these as a possible alternative technology. Other 
refrigeration techniques such as sorption systems and air cycle 
have been tested, but are not energy efﬁcient enough to replace 
the vapour compression technology.
 
Current regulatory policies ignore the additional fuel con-
sumption of air-conditioning (AC) system operation. It might 
be technically possible to reduce the fuel consumption of the 
AC system by up to 30−40%, depending on the option chosen 
and the climate. This could lead to a global reduction in CO2 
emissions of 40 Mtonnes yr-1.
 
Improved HFC-134a systems have a low leakage rate and a 
higher energy efﬁciency. Moreover, further emission reductions 
might be obtained with a full professional service that includes 
recovery, recycling and systematic end-of-life (EOL) recovery. 
This would require refrigerant management policies governed 
by national regulations and incentives.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Alternate low GWP refrigerant systems
AC systems that use CO2 have an entirely new design unique 
to this refrigerant as well as a safety system. A new infrastruc-
ture for servicing will also need to be implemented. The cool-
ing performances of CO2 systems have been demonstrated in 
passenger vehicles from most major car manufacturers as well 
as some commercial buses and an electrical hermetic system 
in prototype fuel cell vehicles. Direct emissions have a very 
low impact due to CO2 GWP. For indirect emissions, CO2 sys-
tems have shown energy efﬁciency comparable to an improved 
HFC-134a system. There are several barriers to the commer-
cialization of this technology. These are the risk of suffocation, 
outstanding technical and cost issues and the need for an en-
tirely new servicing infrastructure.
 
Systems using HFC-152a contain the same components as 
the HFC-134a system but have an added safety system. Cooling 
performances of HFC-152a  systems have been demonstrated 
in passenger vehicles. Direct emissions (CO2-eq) are very low 
(more than 90% reduction compared to HFC-134a base line) 
and HFC-152a systems have an energy efﬁciency comparable 
to the improved HFC-134a system. Barriers to the commercial-
ization of this technology are the risk of ﬂammability and guar-
anteeing a commercial supply of HFC-152a.
System comparison and design considerations
Safety concerns can be mitigated by using identiﬁed, existing 
technologies. Risk assessments for the CO2 and HFC-152a sys-
tems are currently being undertaken.
 
The reference cost of a typical European HFC-134a sys-
tem with an internally-controlled compressor is estimated to be 
about 215 US$. Assuming mass production, the additional cost 
of a CO2 system (including the safety system) is estimated to be 
between 48 and 180 US$. The additional cost of an HFC-152a 
system is estimated to be about 48 US$ for the safety devices 
used for a direct system, or for a secondary loop for the indirect 
system.
 
If development, validation and production lead times are 
considered, the improved HFC-134a system is likely to be 
ready ﬁrst, followed by the HFC-152a system and then the CO2 
system.
 
The servicing infrastructure will need to be prepared for 
the transition to a new refrigerant. This is a signiﬁcant issue 
for each alternative refrigerant system and the burden this will 
place on the service industry needs to be considered, especially 
in developing countries.

6.1 
Introduction
Mobile air-conditioning (MAC) systems have been mass-pro-
duced in the USA since the early 1960s and in Japan since the 
1970s. However, the numbers of air conditioned cars in Europe 
and in developing countries only started to signiﬁcantly in-
crease much later in about 1995.
The rapid switch from CFC-12 to HFC-134a was a global de-
cision taken by all car manufacturers in developed countries. 
The ﬁrst HFC-134a system was installed in 1990 and by 1994 
almost all vehicles sold in developed countries used this refrig-
erant. In developing countries the transition from CFC-12 to 
HFC-134a will be completed in 2008.
 
This chapter addresses an evaluation of the additional fuel 
consumption due to MAC operation. In 2003, this was estimat-
ed to be in the order of 100 Mt CO2-eq emissions. For the same 
year, CO2 equivalent emissions from HFC-134a were about 96 
Mtonnes and those for the remaining CFC-12 in cars were 514 
Mtonnes.
 
There are three main options for reducing GHG emissions: 
Improving the current HFC-134a system or switching to other 
low GWP refrigerants such as HFC-152a or CO2.
6.2 
Current refrigerant banks and emission forecast
Emissions from mobile air-conditioning systems of cars, light 
commercial vehicles (LCVs)and truck cabins are detailed by 
Palandre et al., (2002), Clodic et al., (2004) and Palandre et al., 
(2004) (see also UNEP, 2003). Even though the car industry 
switched from CFC-12 to HFC-134a with effect from 1992, the 
number of vehicles and CFC-12 bank in this ﬂeet is still signiﬁ-
cant (see Table 6.1).
The average lifetime of cars depends on the country. It is 
typically 12 years in Europe and Japan and 16 years in North 
America.
 
For a number of countries, the last 10 years have seen a 
rapid penetration of air-conditioning systems in cars, as shown 
in Figure 6.1 for Europe. This S curve is typical for the intro-
duction of a major technology and a corresponding change of 
consumer habits.
 
In 2000, the worldwide automotive ﬂeet numbered some 
720 million of vehicles. Nearly half of the ﬂeet is equipped with 
AC (361 million).
6.2.1 
AC system characteristics
The average refrigerant charge depends on the type of car and 
the type of refrigerant. Usually HFC-134a systems have about 
a 15% lower charge than CFC-12 charge due to the difference 
in liquid densities of those two refrigerants. Current HFC-134a 
charges vary from 500−900 g. The lifetime of the MAC system 
(9−12 years) is usually considered to be shorter than the car 
lifetime (12−16 years) due to the relatively high cost of repair-
ing AC in older vehicles.
 
A number of studies (Palandre et al., 2002; UNEP, 2003; 
Schwarz and Harnisch, 2003) have shown that annual emission 
rates, including accidents and servicing losses, are between 10 
and 15% of the original charge. Servicing is assumed to take 
place for recharging when the residual charge is between 50 
and 75%. Dependent on servicing habits and regulations, the 
recovery during servicing varies from 0−40% of recoverable 
refrigerant.
6.2.2 
CFC-12, HFC-134a emissions from 1990 to 2003 
and emission forecasts for the period 2004 to 2015 
The emission inventory method described in Ashford et al. 
(2004) is based on IPCC inventory guidelines (IPCC, 1997). 
Using the results of Clodic et al. (2004), Figure 6.2 and Table 
6.2 show the evolution of the refrigerant banks of HFC-134a 
Table 6.1.  Evolution of the CFC-12 and HFC-134a ﬂeet (Clodic et 
al., 2004).

and CFC-12 in the MAC ﬂeet in the past (from 1990 to 2003) 
and for the future (up to 2015) according to a business-as-usual 
scenario1.
 
Figure 6.3 and Table 6.3 present refrigerant emissions for 
the two refrigerant banks. Figure 6.4 and Table 6.4 transform 
CFC-12 and HFC-134a emissions into CO2-eq emissions based 
on their GWP (values from IPCC Second Assessment Report 
(IPCC, 1996)). 
 
Due to the huge difference of the GWP of these two refrig-
erants, Figure 6.4 underlines the signiﬁcant decrease from ap-
proximately 900 MtCO2-eq in 1993 to 610 MtCO2-eq in 2003. 
The switch from CFC-12 to HFC-134a had a clear and positive 
effect on lowering global warming due to refrigerant emissions 
from MACSs.
6.3 
Fuel consumption due to MAC operation
Nowadays the primary energy source for operating MACs is 
supplied by the car engine via two mechanisms: Firstly by the 
direct transfer of mechanical power to the compressor through 
a belt connected to the engine and secondly as the electrical 
power used by the fans and the control system. 
 
Vehicle ACs consume more energy (including its weight) 
than any other auxiliaries currently present in vehicles. Yet

this additional energy consumption is not currently taken into 
account in fuel economy regulatory test cycles. The fuel con-
sumption due to MAC operation can only be measured if the 
usage proﬁle and system energy consumption characteristics 
are known. Up until now, such data has been sparse and incom-
plete.
6.3.1 
Hours of operation by climate/region
In order to estimate the annual fuel consumption of MACs, 
both the climatic conditions (including temperature, humidity 
and solar load) and the usage proﬁle (including average mile-
age, time of day when driving occurs and urban or extra-urban 
driving conditions) must be known. As indicated in Figure 6.5, 
there are signiﬁcant differences in the cooling energy required 
due to climatic conditions. Temperate climates such as that 
in Frankfurt, differ from hot and humid climates, such as in 
Orlando or Miami, by nearly a factor 5 in terms of heat load and 
therefore in cooling energy. 
 
The usage proﬁle ﬁrst of all includes the cool-down opera-
tion with a higher energy consumption and the stabilized oper-
ating conditions with a lower energy consumption. To assess 
the global energy consumption impact of MAC, the repartition 
of urban and extra-urban driving durations needs to be known 
and these differ per country. 
 
At present there are no widely accepted standards for these 
parameters per country or region, even though there is a clear 
need for these. However, initial estimates can be made on the 
basis of several published publications (Benouali et al., 2003b; 
Rugh et al., 2004).
6.3.2 
Fuel consumption and equivalent CO2 emissions
Several factors need to be known in order to calculate CO2 
emissions from MAC operation systems. Firstly the mechani-
cal and electrical energies used by MACs must be measured. 
Secondly the type of engine and the management of the energy 
for the MACs required from the engine must be considered. 
Then from the additional fuel consumption the CO2 emission of 
MAC can be calculated. 
 
The additional fuel consumption due to MAC operation 
mainly depends on climatic conditions. Table 6.5 shows the 
calculated mechanical power required by the compressor. This 
varies from 0.4−3.4 kW depending on the ambient temperature 
and the engine speed (Barrault et al., 2003; Benouali et al., 
2003b). 
 
MAC systems operate for about 24% of the vehicle run-
ning time in northern Europe, 60% in southern Spain and up

to 70% in Phoenix, Arizona. For European diesel engines the 
additional consumption ranges from 23 l yr-1 (Paris) to about 80 
l yr-1 (Sevilla) (see Table 6.6).
 
If climatic conditions, engine type (diesel or gasoline) and 
user proﬁle are taken into account, the annual additional fuel 
consumption is between 2.5 and 7.5%. This corresponds to an 
additional CO2 emission due to MAC operation of between 54.7 
and 221.5 kg CO2 yr-1 per vehicle.
6.3.3 
Estimates of ﬂeet-wide fuel consumption
For the USA, an NREL study has estimated that 26 billion li-
tres of gasoline per year (62 Mtonnes CO2) are currently used 
for cooling (not including defrost). This is equivalent to 5.5% 
of US light-duty vehicle gasoline consumption (Rugh et al., 
2004). The study assumed that compressor power varied with 
rotations per minute (rpm) up to 3.7 kW at 3500 rpm. The as-
sumed AC load penalized the fuel economy by 18% (22 mpg2 
to 18 mpg) for US cars and 14% (18.8 mpg to 16.2 mpg) for 
US trucks. Using the same methodology NREL (Rugh et al., 
2004) estimates the EU MAC fuel consumption to be 6.9 bil-
lion litres (equivalent to 16 MtCO2) and the Japanese to be 1.7 
billion litres (equivalent to 4 MtCO2). These ﬁgures represent 
3.2 and 3.5% of vehicle fuel use respectively. Worldwide, the 
total emissions of air-conditioned cars is estimated to be about 
100 Mtonnes of CO2 Tables 6.7 and 6.8 show the growth of air 
conditioned vehicles in China and India respectively. In 2002 
Hu (Hu et al., 2004) estimates the air-conditioned ﬂeet to be 6.4 
million vehicles. Based on data by Kanwar (2004), the Indian 
AC ﬂeet was estimated to be 4.2 million cars in 2003.
6.3.4 
Future trends and possible improvements in 
energy efﬁciency
Most of the MACs currently used in the total ﬂeet are still basic 
technology (especially in the USA) with a ﬁxed displacement 
compressor and manual control. These systems were not de-
signed with a view to fuel savings. They produce an excess cool-
ing capacity and the desired comfortable temperature is obtained 
by mixing heated air from the heater core to compensate for the 
excess cooling capacity. An on/off control is used to manage the 
system with respect to driving conditions (outside temperature 
and engine rpm). The Improved Mobile Air-conditioning (I-
MAC) partnership is a current global effort to reduce direct re-
frigerant emissions by 50% and indirect emissions by 30%. 
 
Since the mid-1990s, variable capacity technology (internal 
control) has been introduced, mainly in Europe and Japan, to 
limit the energy consumption of MACs. Comparisons of the 
three types of compressor control: On/off, internal control and 
external control (introduced in 2000) show that signiﬁcant en-
ergy savings can be achieved with the appropriate control (Karl 
et al., 2003).
 
However, a reduction in the requested cooling capacity is 
another option for reducing fuel consumption. Insulation of 
doors and roof, limitation of window size and special glass for 
solar load limitation are all parameters which inﬂuence the ﬁnal 
energy consumption of MACs. In practice these solutions have 
a limited usefulness due to the additional cost, extra weight, 
consumer demand for larger windows or safety issues related to 
driver visibility.

Low consumption MAC systems can only be developed if there 
are accepted standards for measuring the energy consumption 
of the MAC system and the additional fuel consumption of the 
vehicle equipped with a given MAC system. 
6.3.5 
Future vehicles and MACs
Environmental concerns are also driving technology changes in 
powertrains, which in turn is affecting MAC design. 
 
The ﬁrst trend is improvements in the energy efﬁciency of 
internal combustion engines (diesel or gasoline). This trend af-
fects both the heating and the cooling modes of the MAC sys-
tem. In cooling mode, a higher engine energy efﬁciency results 
in a higher relative energy penalty due to MAC. This requires 
signiﬁcant efforts to improve MAC energy efﬁciency. High-ef-
ﬁciency engines result in a heating cabin deﬁcit which neces-
sitates the installation of an additional heating function. This is 
why efﬁcient heat pump systems are still being developed in 
competition with current existing solutions based on electrical 
heaters or burners.
 
A second trend is to introduce new functions such as stop-
start (engine is stopped at idle and then restarted), stop & go 
(engine is stopped at idle, then restarted so that a short elec-
trical driving period is possible) and electrical driving mode 
(as with a hybrid powertrain). In order to improve fuel con-
sumption, especially in city trafﬁc conditions, all of these so-
lutions are based on a more or less deep electriﬁcation of the 
car. However, with current MACs, stopping the engine means 
stopping the AC and vehicle occupants do not accept such a loss 
of comfort. Usually the only strategy for sustaining comfortable 
conditions is to restart the engine whilst still in idle. To solve 
this problem, different solutions have been investigated with 
respect to the availability of electrical energy: Cooling power 
storage, hybrid compressors and electrically-driven compres-
sors. Some of these have being introduced onto the market. For 
example, the two-way driven compressor has been developed 
for mass-produced, mild-hybrid vehicles which do not generate 
enough electrical power (Sakai et al., 2004). This compressor 
can be driven by the engine belt whilst the engine is running 
and by the electric motor during engine stop. An electrically-
driven compressor has also been developed for mass-produced, 
strong-hybrid vehicles (Petitjean et al., 2000; Takahashi et al., 
2004). Even if the engine stops, the air-conditioning can still be 
operated efﬁciently.
 
A third trend is to change the energy source of the power-
train by replacing the internal combustion engine with a fuel 
cell. MACs adapted to this type of powertrain will beneﬁt from 
the high level of electrical power available and will be able to 
compensate long stop & go as well as heating or cooling deﬁcits 
of the cabin. One example exists in Japan, where there is a fuel 
cell vehicle equipped with electrical hermetic CO2 heat pump 
systems. 
 
Adapted efﬁcient MACs will be a key issue for the market-
ability of these new powertrains. Methods to qualify efﬁciency 
or fuel consumption will have to be adapted to take into account 
both the special energy management of this new type of power-
train and the adapted driving cycle, especially in city trafﬁc.
6.4 
Technical options for reducing direct and indirect 
emissions
Concerns about global warming associated with HFC-134a 
emissions mean that the impact of the MAC industry on an-
thropogenic greenhouse gas emissions needs to be assessed.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
This involves assessing both industry emissions and proposed 
emission-reduction initiatives for their environmental impact 
and cost-effectiveness. Such initiatives include improving the 
current system as well as investigating possible alternative re-
frigerant systems with a lower climate impact. 
6.4.1 
Improved HFC-134a systems
HFC-134a systems can be improved in two ways. Firstly by im-
proving the containment of the refrigerant and secondly by in-
creasing the energy efﬁciency. Improvements to the HFC-134a 
system are concerned with optimizing current systems and not 
in developing a completely new design. 
6.4.1.1 
Improved leak tightness
The future European Union F-Gas regulation will limit maxi-
mum annual emissions. This will lead to signiﬁcant new efforts 
for improving the leak tightness of MAC systems.
 
At present there is not an agreed leakage test method to 
guarantee the leakage rate of an MAC system installed in a car. 
Each supplier of compressors, condensers, evaporators, hoses, 
etcetera, has their own methodology, using trace gases such as 
helium, for checking the leak tightness of their components. 
SAE standards (SAE, 1989, 1993) deﬁne a test method for hose 
permeation but none of these permit certiﬁcation of the emis-
sion level of AC systems installed in a car. Several projects are 
underway to deﬁne a certiﬁcation method that can ensure the 
certiﬁed level of refrigerant emissions. Various publications 
(Clodic and Fayolle, 2001; Clodic and Ben Yahia, 1997) indi-
cate a large range of leakage rates depending on the technol-
ogy used for hoses, compressor shaft seals and service valves. 
A certiﬁcation method will certainly need to be developed for 
each component: The refrigerant lines, the two heat exchang-
ers and the compressor. Complementary calculations from test 
results are necessary to predict annual emission. Moreover, the 
leak rates depend on the refrigerant pressure and so in turn on 
the climatic conditions under which the car operates throughout 
the year.
6.4.1.2 
Servicing issues and vehicle end of life 
In developed countries car servicing is performed by at least 
three categories of garage: After-sales service from car manu-
facturers, private garages and specialized networks servicing 
only certain parts of vehicles (batteries, exhaust pipes, brakes, 
tyres). Europe now has specialized networks for MAC servicing. 
In the USA the MACS Association (Mobile Air-Conditioning 
Society) has developed a training programme which has gen-
eralized recovery systems in nearly all garages in line with the 
US regulation which has made the recovery of CFC-12 manda-
tory since 1992 and HFC-134a mandatory since 1996. In order 
to signiﬁcantly reduce service-related emissions, technicians 
should be trained to use a recovery and recharge system with 
near zero emissions as a standard procedure. Leak detection 
with high sensitivity leak detectors (in the range of 1 g yr-1) and 
sufﬁcient knowledge to ﬁx the leaks when found, are comple-
mentary steps towards realizing low refrigerant emissions dur-
ing servicing. Nevertheless many of these steps forward can 
be compromized by end-users recharging MACs themselves if 
disposable cans of HFC-134a are available. The global emis-
sions related to these practices are high, and disposable cans of 
HFC-134a will be forbidden by new EU regulation.
 
In many European countries, recovery during servicing 
is not yet mandatory and this might result in high emissions. 
However, good practices have been adopted in many after-sales 
service garages and specialized networks, which systematically 
use standard recovery equipment when the circuit needs to be 
opened. 
 
The increased use of air-conditioned cars in developing 
countries requires the training of servicing personnel and the 
availability of recovery/recycling equipment. The current phase 
out of CFC-12 has permitted the implementation of good prac-
tices in some developing countries, but a number of efforts are 
still needed to avoid large emission rates due to poor servicing 
practices.
 
Looking to the future, the aim is to produce very low-emis-
sion HFC-134a systems by decreasing the level of AC system 
leak tightness to the extent that no recharge is required during 
the system’s lifetime. 
 
The recovery of refrigerant at vehicle end of life could be 
integrated into the global management of the recycling process 
of cars. Such a global recovery and recycling process would 
signiﬁcantly reduce  the additional cost associated with refrig-
erant recovery. At the EU level, refrigerant recovery will be in-
tegrated in the End-of-Life Vehicle Directive (OJEC, 2000).
6.4.1.3 
High efﬁciency systems
As indicated in section 6.3.4, a number of programmes are un-
derway to achieve better control of compressor power. Despite 
this, see (Benouali et al., 2003c; Benouali et al., 2003a), the co-
efﬁcient of performance (COP) measured under realistic condi-
tions (typical driving conditions) is low, 1.3−1.4 for an outdoor 
temperature of 35°C. The use of an external control compressor 
yields signiﬁcant gains in the range of 25−35% on the COP, 
even if the mechanical efﬁciencies of external control compres-
sors are in the same range as internal control compressors. Up 
until now systems have been designed for low cost, reliability 
and cooling capacity but not for energy efﬁciency. A number of 
improvements can still be realized in the development of high 
efﬁciency compressors. Improvements in the evaporator and 
condenser design as well as the control system will result in 
better airﬂow management and therefore energy efﬁciency.
 
With respect to energy efﬁciency improvements, progress 
could be made in standardizing the measurement of energy con-
sumption due to MAC operation in order to facilitate the com-
parison of technical proposals (see section 6.3.4).
6.4.1.4 
LCCP/TEWI
To calculate Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP), all types 
of emissions over the entire cycle should be taken into account, 
including energy consumption related to refrigerant production, 
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   304

direct emissions throughout the lifetime and indirect emissions 
due to energy consumption by the AC system. For HFC-134a 
AC systems, a number of publications (UNEP, 2003; Barrault 
et al., 2003; Schwarz and Harnisch, 2003) indicate that the most 
signiﬁcant parameter is the direct emission level. Depending on 
the recovery policy,  the annual refrigerant emissions for cur-
rent systems are estimated to be 0.106−0.266 kg yr-1 leading to 
138−345 kg CO2-eq yr-1. 
 
If the previous results of CO2 emissions related to MAC 
operation and those different emission levels are taken into ac-
count (see section 6.2.2), the total equivalent warming impact 
(TEWI) of a given MAC system can be calculated. Table 6.9 
presents an example of TEWI calculations for gasoline and die-
sel engines for a MAC system operating in the Frankfurt area. 
 
Table 6.9 summarizes possible gains on indirect emissions 
due to energy consumption and direct emissions of refrigerant. 
Considering the extreme values, it can be seen that refrigerant 
emission reductions can be a highly effective method for reduc-
ing emission impacts. However, at this stage it has yet to be 
demonstrated that MAC systems can be designed with servic-
ing limited to ruptures and accidents.
 
Based on current knowledge of possible energy efﬁciency 
improvements as well as reduction of emissions, Table 6.10 
compares the old CFC-12 and the current HFC-134a systems to 
the improved HFC-134a, CO2 and HFC-152a systems.

CO2 systems
6.4.2.1 
Description of system
Carbon dioxide has zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP). Its 
GWP of 1 is negligible compared to the GWP of HFC-134a. 
Moreover, there is no need to speciﬁcally produce carbon diox-
ide, since it can be recovered from industrial waste gas. Carbon 
dioxide (when used as refrigerant it is called R-744) is cheap, 
readily available in sufﬁcient quantities throughout the world 
and its properties are well known and documented. If used as 
refrigerant there is no need for recovery, which would neces-
sitate servicing, and the recycling cost would be totally elimi-
nated. The refrigerating equipment safety standard (ASHRAE 
34, EN-378) classiﬁes CO2 as an A1 refrigerant, a non-toxic 
and non-ﬂammable refrigerant. But if accidentally lost in large 
quantities, CO2 has a certain asphyxiation risk that needs to 
be mitigated by engineering systems. A refrigeration cycle 
with carbon dioxide as refrigerant operates at comparatively 
high pressures (5–10 times higher than HFC-134a systems). 
However the safety risk of these high pressures is comparable 
to current HFC-134a systems due to the small volume used and 
the low refrigerant mass of the system. 
 
As the critical temperature is approached or even exceeded, 
the ideal cycle efﬁciency decreases with increasing high-side 
pressure. On an ideal basis, the efﬁciency of a transcritical CO2 
cycle is unfavourable compared with that of a HFC-134a cycle. 
However, for real cycles this is compensated by the favourable 
transport properties of CO2 (high heat transfer and low pres-
sure loss), the inclusion of an internal heat exchanger and the 
improved compressor efﬁciency due to low pressure ratios. 
Under normal operating conditions for vehicle air-conditioning 
systems the carbon dioxide cycle often operates in the ‘tran-
scritical’ mode due to the low critical temperature (31°C). For 
example, Pettersen (1994) showed that the high-side pressure 
inﬂuences the COP of the system and there is an optimum pres-
sure for this. He suggested that during normal operation a high-
side pressure close to the optimum pressure should be selected 
in order to maintain a satisfactory COP. This means the pressure 
should be kept at a certain level dependent on the heat rejection 
temperature (ambient air temperature).
 
A special ﬂow circuit enabling efﬁcient operation and 
high-side pressure control has been designed and patented 
by Lorentzen et al. (1993) (see also Lorentzen and Pettersen, 
1993). This particular refrigeration cycle is shown in Figure 6.6 
and serves as the worldwide basis for the majority of car AC 
systems which use carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. The p-h dia-
gram in Figure 6.6 depicts two different high-side pressures for 
different control conditions for which the compression process 
has been calculated with the same isentropic efﬁciency.

With this refrigeration cycle the high-side pressure can be 
controlled, for example, by an electronic expansion valve. Each 
high-side pressure corresponds to a particular refrigerant charge 
circulating in the cycle. The receiver located between the evap-
orator and the internal heat exchanger on the low-pressure side 
stores the refrigerant charge which is not needed for the par-
ticular operating condition. The presence of the internal heat 
exchanger provides protection for the compressor from liquid 
slugging and may yield to an increased cooling capacity at high 
ambient air temperature conditions.
 
A CO2 refrigeration cycle different from the Lorentzen/
Pettersen cycle approach was used by Sonnekalb (2002) (see 
also Sonnekalb and Köhler, 2000) for bus AC systems which 
use carbon dioxide as refrigerant. Based on the fact that the 
COP compared with high-side pressure curve is relatively ﬂat, 
Sonnekalb designed a low-cost CO2 system for bus air-con-
ditioning. This system (which can be seen in Figure 6.7) has 
only four major components with a ﬁxed refrigerant charge.

Sonnekalb showed that it is possible to operate this particular 
cycle over a wide range of ambient air temperatures close to the 
maximum COP without a high-side pressure control. Figure 6.7 
presents on the right-hand side a charge-ambient air tempera-
ture diagram with the optimal COP curve. The range of a 5% or 
less decline of this optimal COP can also be seen as a shaded 
area. The dashed horizontal line in the diagram shows that it 
is possible to cover a wide range of ambient air temperature 
conditions with a ﬁxed charge whilst incurring only minor COP 
losses (5% or less). 
 
In the years 1996 and 1997 two CO2 prototypes based on 
this cycle were installed in standard city buses in Bad Hersfeld, 
Germany. By the end of 2003 the AC systems of these two bus-
es had together accumulated more than 4000 running hours on 
the road, indicating that this CO2 system is technically and eco-
nomically feasible for bus AC (for more details see also Köhler 
et al., 1998 and Foersterling et al., 2002). 
 
Since 1997 prototype CO2 systems have been demonstrated 
by many vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers in a wide 
range of vehicles (Wolf 2004). For example, BMW successful-
ly ran a small test ﬂeet of 7 vehicles with prototype AC systems 
between 2000 and 2002 (Mager 2002). Toyota have also run a 
ﬁrst ﬂeet test in Japan and the USA using approximately 15 fuel 
cell hybrid vehicles .
 
If used in a heat pump mode, CO2 has a superior refriger-
ant performance (see for example Heyl and Fröhling, 2001 or 
Hesse et al., 2002). Modern fuel-efﬁcient direct injection gaso-
line or diesel engines may not have enough waste heat to sufﬁ-
ciently heat the passenger compartment. Additional heaters (for 
example positive temperature coefﬁcient (PTC) heaters, fuel 
burners, or other technologies) increase fuel consumption and 
CO2 emissions. The CO2 heat pump might be an attractive fu-
ture alternative with respect to performance, energy efﬁciency 
and total cost (AC plus heater). More research is needed to de-
termine which is the most suitable for car application.
 
In summary, CO2 systems need a new design for all compo-
nents (compared to usual HFC-134a technology). This involves 
an ongoing learning process.
6.4.2.2 
Energy efﬁciency
Carbon dioxide is a typical high-pressure refrigerant with a cor-
respondingly high volumetric cooling capacity. Therefore, com-
pared to low-pressure HFCs, higher cooling capacities can be 
achieved in a given volume. This results in excellent cool down 
curves (or heat up curves for the heat pumps) as demonstrated, 
for example, by Vetter and Memory (2003). However, com-
paring the energy efﬁciency and fuel consumption of a carbon 
dioxide and corresponding HFC system is far more difﬁcult. 
From the results in a number of publications it can be surmised 
that compared to an improved HFC-134a system, carbon diox-
ide has a comparable or even better COP and a correspondingly 
lower fuel consumption, especially for lower ambient air tem-
peratures. At high ambient air temperatures, improved HFC-
134a systems have advantages at lower compressor speeds. 
Based on measurements made by Hrnjak (2003), Wertenbach 
(2004) calculated the AC energy demand for typical European 
and US driving cycles. His results show different energy de-
mands for Europe and the USA are due to the selected running 
time in the drive cycles and the different climatic conditions. 
Nevertheless the energy efﬁciency beneﬁts of the systems are 
about the same for Europe and the USA. Compared to a base-
line HFC-134a system, an improved HFC-134a system showed 
23% less energy demand whereas an efﬁciency-optimized CO2 
system showed about 30% less energy demand. Hafner et al. 
(2004) obtained comparable results in their energy analysis.
 
Compared to HFC-134a, CO2 has a disadvantage of low ef-
ﬁciency at idling and high load conditions. Compact vehicles 
are generally at a disadvantage as far as the refrigeration cycle 
efﬁciency is concerned compared to medium or large vehicles. 
This is due to space constraints which limit the condenser and 
evaporator sizes. Actual vehicle tests have shown that in com-
pact vehicles, the increase in compressor power consumption 
with CO2 has an adverse effect on vehicle driving characteristics 
such as acceleration and fuel economy, even though equivalent 
or better cooling performance can be maintained (Kobayashi 
et al., 1999). Further technical developments are required for 
CO2 compact vehicles to counteract this. An ejector, which can 
recover the expansion energy and reduce the compressor power 
might be a potential solution (Takeuchi et al., 2004).
6.4.2.3 
Cost
The real cost of a CO2 AC system (or the additional cost com-
pared to current AC systems) is hard to estimate as the CO2 sys-
tem has not yet entered mass production. The additional costs 
compared to a current system are expected to be between 48 and 
180 US$ (Mager et al., 2003; Barrault et al., 2003; NESCCAF, 
2004) for the ﬁrst generation of mass-produced systems. No 
cost data are available regarding the conversion of the service 
system.
6.4.2.4 
LCCP/TEWI
Aspects concerning the certainty of energy efﬁciency also apply 
to calculations of the Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) 
or the Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI). The results

from different publications are not always comparable, as the 
speciﬁc results depend strongly on the assumptions made. In an 
LCCP study, Hafner et al. (2004) compared an improved HFC-
134a system with a corresponding CO2 system (based on mea-
sured data published by Hrnjak, 2003). The authors assumed 
NEDC and US FTP 75 driving cycles. The total hours with 
AC on were based on regional climate data and usage proﬁles 
provided by Sand et al. (1997) and Duthie et al. (2002). The 
direct HFC-134a emissions were calculated assuming total sys-
tem losses of 60 g yr-1. The end-of-life recovery was assumed 
to be 80%. The authors also took into account the 77 kg CO2-
eq emissions caused by the production of 1 kg of HFC-134a 
(see Campbell and McCulloch, 1998). The authors analyzed 
the LCCP of the HFC-134a and the CO2 systems for different 
climatic regions in the USA and Europe. Their results show a 
17−49% reduction in LCCP for the CO2 system compared to the 
improved HFC-134a system. Table 6.10 shows a reduction of 
nearly 40% in the LCCP for the CO2 system.
6.4.2.5 
Leakage rate of complete system
Froehling et al., (2003) assessed the upper acceptable limits of 
refrigerant leakage. He assumes that the operating time of CO2 
AC systems without recharging should be about 6 years. This 
leads to an annual emission rate of 25g or less, half of which is 
related to the shaft seal of the compressor. Additional research 
and development on low leakage hoses and ﬁttings, compressor 
shaft seals, durability and accurate methods of leak rate mea-
surements is currently being undertaken to realize this goal.
6.4.2.6 
Reliability
Air-conditioning with CO2 is a new system and virtually all of 
the components need to be redesigned. In terms of reliability 
the main tasks to be completed are:
• Development of economical, leak-tight CO2 hoses and com-
pressor shaft seals;
• Demonstration of reliability under real-world conditions; 
• Development of service and maintenance best practices. 
In order to ensure uniform quality and reliability, a workgroup 
of German OEMs has proposed a component speciﬁcation 
Standard CO2 AC System (Mager et al., 2004). This speciﬁca-
tion deﬁnes the main and auxiliary components of the system 
and sets their operating conditions, performance and limits.
6.4.2.7 
Safety
Due to the high pressure of the CO2 systems risks of rupture 
which could lead to burst hazards must be mitigated. The basic 
design concept of car air-conditioners is described in SAE J639 
(SAE, 1999). CO2 car air-conditioners are currently being stan-
dardized and the revisions of the set values for safety devices 
such as the design pressure, proof pressure and pressure relief 
valve took into account the signiﬁcant pressure levels that can 
arise in CO2-refrigerant car air-conditioners (Kim et al., 2003; 
Wertenbach, 2004).
 
Leakage of CO2 into the passenger cabin creates risks of 
impairment. The US EPA allows 6% v/v and 4% v/v as upper 
boundary limits for exposure of up to 2 minutes and 60 minutes 
respectively and speciﬁes that the exposure should not exceed 
6% under any circumstance. An active safety system, such as a 
refrigerant-based sensor safety concept (which is also currently 
under scrutiny for ﬂammable refrigerants), might not be effec-
tive enough due to uncertainties about the sensor, its location 
and the actuators behind the sensor. The VDA ad hoc work-
ing group of car manufacturers has proposed a passive safety 
concept based on supplementing the standard speciﬁcations 
mentioned in Section 6.4.2.6. These additional speciﬁcations 
would cover all AC systems from manual to automatic control 
and would consider all vehicle operating conditions (Rebinger, 
2004). This passive safety concept is based on the so-called 
‘safe evaporator’, which means a negligible risk of leaking or 
bursting under any operating condition of the car. 
 
As well as the aforementioned issues, the safety of the ‘ser-
vice’ offered in the marketplace – how to handle CO2 safely 
– is another important safety issue. Devices such as a refriger-
ant charging machine, which can read the amount of refriger-
ant from bar-coded information in the service manual and au-
tomatically charge CO2, have already been developed (Lorenz, 
2002).
6.4.3 
HFC-152a systems
6.4.3.1 
Description of a direct expansion system
HFC-152a systems are identical to the current HFC-134a sys-
tem, but may have added safety features, such as solenoid 
valves or discharge devices. 
 
A direct expansion HFC-152a system was demonstrated at 
the 2002 SAE Alternate Refrigerants Symposium (SAE, 2002a). 
This was a joint venture between the US government, a major 
car manufacturer and a major MAC system supplier (Andersen 
et al., 2002). The large vehicle system contained just 0.45 kg of 
refrigerant and compared to the equivalent current HFC-134a 
system it showed a better cooling performance for high loads 
and a comparable cooling performance for low loads. In a direct 
refrigerant replacement with no component changes, HFC-152a 
showed a 3−17% lower energy usage than HFC-134a and was 
on average about 10% lower (Ghodbane et al., 2003). 
 
Leakage of HFC-152a into the passenger cabin creates risks 
of ﬁre. The US EPA allows 3.7% v/v for up to 15 s as an upper 
boundary limit in any part of the free space of the passenger 
cabin.
 
The safety system (Figure 6.8) consists of an HFC-152a 
sensor, mounted in the evaporator case, capable of detecting 
the presence of HFC-152a. If detected above a threshold level, 
a signal is sent to a controller, which activates a directed relief 
mechanism. The relief mechanism consists of two squib-initi-
ated discharge devices, one on the high-pressure side and one 
on the low-pressure side of the system. The discharged refriger-
ant is directed away from the vehicle by hoses attached to the 
discharge devices. Therefore, the system is designed to safely 
discharge the refrigerant away from the vehicle when leakage

Chapter 6: Mobile Air Conditioning
309
is detected or a vehicle crash situation occurs. In the case of 
a crash, the discharge would be activated by the airbag crash-
sensing system. Such a discharge quickly reduces the pressure 
in the system. This rapidly eliminates the driving force (pres-
sure) for unwanted leakage elsewhere, thereby reducing any 
risk. The sensing system is capable of continuous monitoring 
when the vehicle is being driven and intermittent monitoring 
when the vehicle is parked. 
 
In the event of a leak into the passenger cabin the safety sys-
tem is reported to be able to discharge the refrigerant so fast that 
no signiﬁcant amount of HFC-152a enters the passenger cabin. 
6.4.3.2 
Description of a HFC-152a  indirect system
At the 2003 SAE Alternate Refrigerants Symposium (SAE, 
2003), a direct expansion HFC-152a system and a secondary 
loop HFC-152a system were demonstrated (Ghodbane and 
Fernqvist, 2003). 
 
The secondary loop system (Figure 6.9) was jointly dem-
onstrated by a major European car manufacturer and a major 
MAC system supplier (Ghodbane and Fernqvist, 2003). The 
system was demonstrated on a Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) with 
front and rear evaporators. A secondary loop system (Figure 
6.9) would overcome the concern of leakage into the passen-
ger cabin by allowing the refrigerant to be contained under 
the hood where it is completely separated from the passenger 
compartment. The refrigerant cools a chiller (liquid-liquid heat 
exchanger), which, in turn, chills a water-glycol mixture that 
is then pumped into the passenger cabin heat exchanger(s) for 
cooling. This system would use the same components as the 
current HFC-134a system, with the addition of a chiller and 
liquid pump. It would therefore require a limited capital invest-
ment. For the dual evaporator SUV, the HFC-134a charge was 
1.3 kg compared to just 0.59 kg of HFC-152a for the secondary 
loop system – a signiﬁcant reduction. This vehicle had one of 
the highest cooling performances of all of the vehicles demon-
strated at the symposium. 
From an energy perspective, a secondary loop requires about 
10% more energy than a direct system. However, the great-
er energy efﬁciency of HFC-152a compared to HFC-134a 
(about 10%) would result in comparable cooling performance 
with comparable energy efﬁciency (Ghodbane and Fernqvist, 
2003).
 
From a general safety perspective, the small amount of 
HFC-152a refrigerant needed, combined with its relatively low 
ﬂammability and an effective safety system such as those de-
scribed above, would result in a vehicle that would be both safe 
to drive and safe to park in a garage. Of course, safety during 
vehicle servicing and repair must also be considered. 
6.4.3.3 
Energy efﬁciency
The HFC-152a system described in 6.3.3.1 was an HFC-134a 
system that was ﬁrst tested with HFC-134a and then simply 
charged with HFC-152a to provide a direct comparison with 
no component changes. HFC-152a provided better cooling (2–
3oC) and used 7–20% less energy than HFC-134a, reinforcing 
the results of the 2002 study. This vehicle had one of the highest 
cooling performances of all of the vehicles demonstrated at the 
symposium. 
6.4.3.4 
System costs and availability of HFC-152a
At present, only relatively small amounts of HFC-152a are pro-
duced globally; the major manufacturer is in the USA. Three 
manufacturers producing small quantities exist in China and one 
in Japan. Production capacity would have to be developed for 
HFC-152a to be used in MAC systems and with the necessary 
capital investment this would take several years to achieve.
 
Due to the simpler processing, HFC-152a ought to cost less 
than HFC-134a. However, the MAC system would cost an ad-
ditional 25–48 US$ to cover the cost of the safety system for a

6.4.3.5 
LCCP, TEWI
HFC-152a has been proposed as a replacement for HFC-134a 
because its global warming potential is about 10 times lower 
and it can be used with current HFC-134a components without 
any major modiﬁcation (Baker et al., 2003; Ghodbane, 2003; 
Scherer et al., 2003). 
 
HFC-152a has been assigned a GWP of 122 as opposed to 
1410 for HFC-134a leading to a reduction in global warming 
impact of more than 90%. Moreover, the lower liquid density of 
HFC-152a compared to HFC-134a implies a refrigerant charge 
that is only 65% of the reference HFC-134a charge. For exam-
ple, an HFC-134a system using 0.5 kg would be replaced by an 
HFC-152a system using 0.325 kg. This reduction in refrigerant 
charge will lead to lower emissions in the event of rupture and 
at vehicle end of life. The greater energy efﬁciency of the HFC-
152a over HFC-134a would result in enough fuel savings to 
offset the GWP of HFC-152a. The net result of replacing HFC-
134a with HFC-152a would be the elimination of the direct cli-
mate impact associated with current HFC-134a MAC systems. 
This has also been shown by Hafner et al. (2004). Table 6.10 
shows a reduction of almost 40% in LCCP for the HFC-152a 
system compared to an energy-optimized HFC-134a system.
6.4.3.6 
Safety aspects of future vehicle air-conditioning 
systems 
HFC-152a is a moderately ﬂammable gas and is listed by 
the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-
Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 34 (ASHRAE, 
2001) as a Class A2 refrigerant, deﬁned as being of lower ﬂam-
mability than Class A3 (hydrocarbons such as propane). As a 
reference, HFC-134a is Class A1, low toxicity and non-ﬂam-
mable. The ﬂammability of HFC-152a will probably require 
added safety features such as those described below. 
 
HFC-134a systems and the CFC-12 systems they replaced, 
are considered safe for the intended use. Replacement refrig-
erant systems must also provide a comparable level of safety 
for both vehicle occupants and service technicians. SAE J639 
(SAE, 1999), SAE J1739 (SAE, 2002b) and refrigerant manu-
facturer’s safety data information all serve as reference docu-
ments for designing safe systems. The latest draft of SAE J639 
(SAE, 1999) provides an example of the conditions for safe de-
sign that must be met. For example, ‘For refrigerants contained 
in components that are located within the passenger compart-
ment, or in direct contact with passenger compartment airﬂow 
(e.g., evaporators and associated lines and ﬁttings), system de-
sign shall be such that neither a harmful nor a ﬂammable condi-
tion will result from a release of refrigerant into the passenger 
compartment.’.
 
SAE J1739 (SAE, 2002b) requires a safety assessment of 
proposed systems (by Failure Mode and Effects Analysis us-
ing the Risk Priority Number) for the purpose of identifying all 
anticipated events that result in safety concerns and then taking 
appropriate preventative, or mitigating action. 
 
In addition, all regional, national and local regulations and 
codes for the safe handling of new refrigerants and new refrig-
erant systems must be satisﬁed (e.g., ﬂammability and pressure 
vessel requirements). Managing costs and risks will be an im-
portant part of implementing alternatives. 
6.4.4 
HC-blend systems
In Australia and the USA, hydrocarbon blends, mostly HC-
290/600a (propoane/isobutane) blends, have been introduced 
as drop-in refrigerants to replace CFC-12 and to a lesser extent 
for HFC-134a. The real number of cars that have been retro-
ﬁtted with such HC refrigerant blends is unknown. Maclaine-
Cross (2004) has estimated that it is about 330,000 vehicles in 
Australia, although no data exist to conﬁrm this. No accidents 
have been reported to date. These retroﬁts with HCs are legal in 
some Australian states and illegal in others and in the USA. US 
EPA has forbid the uses of HCs for retroﬁt but has considered 
the possible use of HCs for new systems, providing safety is-
sues are mitigated.
 
HCs or HC-blends, when correctly chosen, present suitable 
thermodynamic properties for the vapour compression cycle 
and permit high energy efﬁciency to be achieved with well-
designed systems. They have zero ODP and low GWPs, but 
their high ﬂammability (lower ﬂammability limit in the range 
of 1.8−2.1% v/v) means that they have not been considered by 
car manufacturers.
 
Some studies have been carried out using hydrocarbons in 
indirect systems, in which a water-glycol circuit provides cool-
ing capacity in the cabin. This water-glycol coolant is in turn 
refrigerated by the refrigerating system using hydrocarbons 
(same system as the secondary loop system presented above 
for HFC-152a). Nevertheless, even with indirect systems, HCs 
are not seen by vehicle manufacturers as replacement ﬂuids for 
mass-produced AC systems.
6.4.5 
Alternative technologies to vapour compression
There are two types of alternative technologies:  The Brayton-
Joule air cycle and a number of heat-generated cooling sys-
tems.
6.4.5.1 
Air cycle
The air cycle has been thoroughly investigated by Bhatti (1998). 
Even if air is used as a refrigerant, with a zero GWP, the energy 
efﬁciency of the system is very low. Calculations of air cycle 
efﬁciency compared to the current HFC-134a system show an 
energy penalty of about 35%. Nevertheless, from the TEWI 
analysis the author concludes that the amount of CO2 emitted 
per year is in the same range (303 kg CO2 for the air cycle com-
pared with 282 kg CO2 for current HFC-134a systems).
6.4.5.2 
Metal hydrides
A review by Johnson (2002) evaluates the opportunities for dif-

ferent cooling cycles using the available heat from the exhaust 
gas. A ﬁrst approach is the use of a metal hydride heat pump 
which makes use of the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen 
by metals. Desorption is an endothermic reaction and so ab-
sorbs heat, whereas adsorption is exothermic and releases heat. 
Metal hydride systems are interesting due to the small number 
of moving parts. No refrigerant is needed but the COP is sig-
niﬁcantly lower, in the range of 0.4−1.5. The possible heat re-
covery from the exhaust gas is also interesting. A ﬁrst prototype 
has been developed in the USA, with a 5 kW AC system. The 
system weight was 22 kg and the COP was 0.33.
6.4.5.3 
Absorption systems
Absorption systems that use either ammonia water or water-
LiBr as working solution are well known. These systems use 
mainly heat but they need electrical energy for the fans and 
pump. The main drawback of absorption systems for cars is 
the heating-up time needed before cooling capacity can be pro-
duced to create the temperature level necessary in the boiler to 
produce refrigerant vapour. This system therefore needs a re-
frigerant storage as well as a minimum operating time of about 
half an hour before efﬁcient cooling operation. 
6.4.5.4 
Adsorption zeolite systems
Zeolite systems are similar to metal hydride systems but use 
zeolite and water instead of metal hydride and hydrogen. The 
adsorption / desorption cycles usually need several separate re-
action chambers for successive cycles in order to reach pseudo-
continuous operation. Studies have been actively carried out for 
electrical vehicles using a burner to operate the AC system. The 
COP is considered to be relatively low (0.3−1.2). No prototype 
has been built in real cars in order to verify the performances. 
6.4.5.5 
Thermo-acoustics
Sound waves create small temperature oscillations. If those 
oscillations release or absorb heat within a regenerator, a sig-
niﬁcant temperature difference can be realized between the hot 
and the cold ends. A resonant cavity is used to enhance the ef-
ﬁciency of thermo-acoustics systems. A COP up to 2 has been 
achieved on a laboratory test bench. However, the integration 
of the system into cars could be difﬁcult due to the possible size 
of system needed for a capacity of about 3 kW.
6.5 
Heat-load reduction and new design of AC systems
Independent of the vapour compression system, research is un-
derway to improve comfort conditions in car cabins. If energy 
consumption is not integrated as a constraint in those develop-
ments then it might be compromized by them. For example, 
panoramic roofs may increase heat loads in the cabin, but devel-
opment of efﬁcient reﬂecting glasses can mitigate the extra heat 
loads while improving the vision of car passengers. New de-
signs such as ventilated seats associated with heating and cool-
ing systems may lower the needed cooling or heating capacity, 
due to a far more effective diffusion of cooling or heat close to 
the body. Insulation of the car itself may have contradictory ef-
fects for summer and winter conditions and compromises will 
have to be found in order to improve the fast heat-up of the 
vehicle in the winter and fast cool-down in the summer. The 
AC system and car cabin must be jointly designed to achieve 
thermal comfort and low energy consumption.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Following the mainstream introduction of HFC use in 2002, the 
phase-out of the use of ozone-depleting substances in the foam 
sector in the majority of developed countries is only now pro-
gressing towards completion. Consequently, predicting HFC 
usage patterns has been notoriously difﬁcult and the downsiz-
ing of HFC demand estimates has been a feature of the last 
3–5 years, being driven signiﬁcantly by the costs of HFC-based 
systems when compared with other options.
 
Nevertheless, HFCs are being used in those applications 
where investment cost, product liability, process safety, and 
thermal efﬁciency are particularly important elements in the 
decision process. Where HFCs are used, careful consideration 
has been given to the use of blowing-agent blends for both cost 
and environmental reasons. Co-blowing with CO2 (water)1 has 
emerged as an important way of limiting HFC consumption 
in key applications such as the US appliance industry and the 
global spray-foam market. 
 
It is now estimated that global HFC consumption in the 
foam sector is unlikely to exceed 75,000 tonnes annually in the 
period to 2015. This represents around 20% of the consumption 
that would have been associated with CFCs in the absence of 
the Montreal Protocol and around 50% of the uptake anticipated 
when the situation was ﬁrst reviewed at the IPCC/TEAP Petten 
Conference in 1999. Not-in-kind insulation materials, such as 
mineral ﬁbre, have continued to be the predominant choice in 
most global markets, primarily because of cost. Accordingly, 
foams are only used where their properties add value. 
 
Hydrocarbon technologies have been widely adopted in 
several foam sub-sectors, including domestic appliances, wa-
ter heaters, polyurethane (PU) sandwich panels, PU boardstock 
and some PU integral skin applications, and are expected to 
represent >55% of overall blowing-agent usage globally in 
the period after 2005. Progress into other sub-sectors has been 
thwarted by speciﬁc investment cost, product and process safe-
ty and, to a lesser extent, thermal performance. 
 
HCFCs will continue to be used in foam applications in de-
veloping countries throughout the period and consumption has 
been predicted to grow to just under 50,000 tonnes by 2015. 
This assessment concurs broadly with the estimate in the 2003 
TEAP HCFC Task Force Report (UNEP-TEAP, 2003), despite 
the different method used. Table 7A summarizes the projected 
consumption and emission pattern as at 2015, together with an 
assessment of the remaining blowing agent bank. The fact that 
annual emissions are not equivalent to annual consumption ﬁg-
ures reﬂects the fact that most applications for which HCFCs, 
HFCs and hydrocarbons are considered as closed cell foams 
with time-delayed emission proﬁles. 
 
As shown in Table 7A, emissions of HCFCs are expected 
to plateau in the 20,000–25,000 tonnes per annum range in the 
period after 2005, with decreases in production emissions from 
phase-out in developed countries being offset by emissions from 
domestic refrigerators at end of life. In contrast, the trend for 
HFC emissions will continue to be gradually upwards through 
the period of assessment as the bank builds. However, the most 
signiﬁcant bank remains that related to CFCs. This is partly as-
sociated with the long period of historic use, but the impact of 
emissions on climate change is accentuated by the high average 
global warming potential (GWP) of the CFCs emitted. On the 
basis of current projections, and if there is no effort to instigate 
further end-of-life emission reduction options, the impact of 
CFC emissions will remain predominant, at least until 2050. 
 
There is signiﬁcant potential for managing emissions of 
CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs through further substitution, reduc-
tion in emissions during foam production/installation and im-
provements in end-of-life management. Some of these options 
involve innovation in building construction, allowing for disas-
sembly as part of end-of-life management (e.g. the wider use 
of pre-fabricated building elements), while others involve the 
improved engineering of foam processes. As highlighted by 
Table 7A, the delayed release of blowing agents from both new 
and existing foamed products generates signiﬁcant banks of 
blowing agent and there is a particular opportunity to focus on 
end-of-life issues both for recovery of existing materials con-
taining ozone-depleting substances and also for future HFCs. 
The technical and economic potential for recovery still has to 
be fully quantiﬁed, although a lot of work is on-going now to 
Table 7A. Projected global consumption and emissions of blowing agent by type as at 2015

do so. However, this potential is likely to differ widely between 
sectors and applications. Although some emission management 
measures can be implemented relatively quickly, implementa-
tion in most cases is expected to be after 2007. Recognizing 
that the precise mix of measures cannot be fully deﬁned at this 
stage, this chapter assesses the comparative impact of three sce-
narios: 
• a linear decrease in the use of HFCs between 2010 and 2015, 
leading to a 50% reduction by 2015;
• the adoption of strategies for the reduction of production 
emissions in the block foam sub-sector from 2005 and from 
2008 onwards in other foam sub-sectors;
• the extension of existing end-of-life measures to all 
appliances and steel-faced panels by 2010, together with a 
20% recovery rate from other building-based foams from 
2010 onwards.
Table 7B indicates the cumulative emission savings resulting 
from these three scenarios and gives an early indication of the 
likely costs based on initial assessments documented in the lit-
erature. 
 
It can be seen that focusing on the reduction of HFC con-
sumption provides the most signiﬁcant saving in the period to 
2015 and that, if any such reduction is extrapolated to use pat-
terns after 2015, it offers the greatest ‘HFC-speciﬁc’ beneﬁt up 
to 2100 as well. In contrast, end-of-life measures deliver lower 
savings in the period to 2015, but have the potential to deliver 
more overall savings in the period to 2100 if all blowing-agent 
types are considered. The value is particularly signiﬁcant for 
CFCs, where GWPs are substantive and there is an incremental 
effect on ozone depletion. 
 
The future consumption patterns for HFCs in the foam sec-
tor beyond 2005 are heavily reliant on the wider role of foams 
in energy conservation and, in particular, building renovation. 
It is expected that spray foam techniques may have a particular 
role to play. The development of well-grounded responsible-use 
guidelines will be vital for both the foam industry and climate 
change policymakers in order to ensure the most appropriate 
use of HFCs and the control of emissions, where applicable. 
However, in all cases, it will be necessary to assess the overall 
incremental energy beneﬁt, together with the non-preventable 
direct emissions, in a policy-level comparison.
 
To illustrate the signiﬁcance of energy-related emission sav-
ings, Table 7C provides typical ratios of CO2 emissions saved

by HFC-based foam to direct emissions of the HFC blowing 
agent during the lifecycle. In this instance, three typical appli-
cations were evaluated (Solvay, 2000).
 
These ratios do not imply that it is always essential to use 
HFC-blown foams to achieve the best overall thermal perfor-
mance, but do illustrate that small incremental changes in ther-
mal efﬁciency from the use of HFCs can have substantial over-
all emission beneﬁts, primarily as a result of the long lifetime 
of most buildings. The beneﬁts can be particularly signiﬁcant if 
HFCs are recovered at disposal. 
 
HCFC consumption in developing countries will be frozen 
after 2015 under the Montreal Protocol and will be phased out 
by 2040. In the business-as-usual analysis in this chapter, it is 
assumed that the decline is linear between 2030 and 2040. There 
is less certainty about HFC use beyond 2015, but the degree 
of innovation that has marked the last 20 years would suggest 
that the foam industry is unlikely to be reliant on HFCs beyond 
2030. Accordingly, the business-as-usual analysis proposes a 
freeze in consumption at 2015 levels and a linear decline in use 
between 2020 and 2030.

7.1 
Foam markets
7.1.1 
Foams by broad grouping and application
Foamed (or cellular) polymers have been used historically in 
a variety of applications, utilizing the potential for creating 
both ﬂexible and rigid structures. Flexible foams continue to be 
used effectively for furniture cushioning, packaging and impact 
management (safety) foams. Rigid foams are used primarily for 
thermal insulation applications of the types required for appli-
ances, transport and in buildings. Rigid foams are also used to 
provide structural integrity and buoyancy. 
 
For thermal insulation applications (the majority of rigid 
foam use), mineral-ﬁbre alternatives (e.g. glass ﬁbre and rock 
wool) have been, and continue to be, major not-in-kind alterna-
tives. Table 7.1 illustrates the major beneﬁts and limitations of 
both approaches.
 
The implications of these relative beneﬁts and limitations 
vary substantially, both between products, within a category 
and between applications. This makes a generic conclusion 
about preferences impossible. The current thermal insulation 
market supports a variety of solutions (at least 15 major prod-
uct types) and this reﬂects the range of properties demanded 
for the applications served. Unfortunately, only limited data are 
available covering the thermal insulation market at the global 
and regional levels. One of the complexities of global-market 
analysis is that building practice around the world varies, often 
responding to material availability and climatic conditions. 
 
In reviewing the not-in-kind options, it is important to ac-
knowledge continuing development. It looks likely that the use 
of vacuum panels in domestic refrigerators and freezers will 
increase and already most Japanese units contain at least one 
such panel in strategic design positions. However, the price im-
plications of such technology choices make them relevant only 
when they are required to meet legislation relating to energy 
efﬁciency or where the market is clearly willing to pay the nec-
essary premium. 
 
There are at least twenty sub-sectors to be considered in any 
assessment of the market for foams. These are broken down in 
the Tables 7.2 and 7.3 according to whether they relate primar-
ily to thermal insulation applications or not. This means that 
there is a mix of ﬂexible and rigid foams in the Table 7.3.
 
Table 7.2 gives an indication of how this segmentation 
works for insulating foams. There are also a number of applica-
tions for non-insulation foams. These are shown in Table 7.3. 
7.1.2 
Energy savings
One of the prime reasons for using thermally insulating materi-
als is to save energy. This objective is particularly important 
when the materials are used in the fabric of buildings and their 
related services, and also when they are used in appliances and 
equipment in our homes, ofﬁces and factories. As indicated in 
Tables 7.2 and 7.3, various materials meet the requirements for 
both these application areas and the following sections illustrate 
the importance of their role in the two categories. 
7.2.2.1 
Buildings (including building services, renovations)
Global assessments of carbon dioxide emissions have consis-
tently revealed that emissions from the use of buildings (in-
cluding appliances used in buildings) represent 30–40% of the 
global total. (Price et al., 1998). In the industrialized countries 
of the northern hemisphere, this can rise as high as 40–50% 
(Ashford, 1998). The reduction of these emissions depends on 
two parallel strategies. The ﬁrst consists of reducing the carbon 
intensity of the energy used by fuel by switching to alternatives 
with less carbon (e.g. natural gas) or by using more renewable 
energy. The second consists of improving the energy efﬁcien-
cy of the buildings themselves, including the appliances used 
within them. The evaluation of some strategies developed by 
governments in this area has made it increasingly clear that the 
scope for fuel switching and the rate of investment in renewable 
energy sources between now and 2050 will not be sufﬁcient 
to achieve sustainable carbon dioxide emission levels by 2050 
(e.g. Carbon Trust, 2002). This has led to the recognition of 
the central role of energy efﬁciency measures in any strategy 
and the introduction of such ground-breaking measures as the 
Energy Performance in Buildings Directive from the European 
Union (OJ, 2003).
 
The delivery of more energy efﬁcient buildings and ap-
pliances is a complex issue. A recent cost-abatement analysis 
conducted by the Building Research Establishment in the UK 
(Pout et al., 2002) revealed that over 100 bona ﬁde measures 
exist to improve the energy performance of buildings alone. 
The IPCC has made similar observations earlier (IPCC, 2001). 
Accordingly, solutions need to be tailored to the circumstances

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
and the requirements of individual buildings. This can include 
aspects involving building services (e.g. pipe insulation) as well 
as measures associated with the fabric of the building itself. 
The approach adopted is necessarily different for new buildings 
than for existing buildings and there always has to be a balance 
between ‘passive’, fabric-based measures such as double- or 
triple-glazed windows and ‘active’ measures such as improved 
controls for the internal climate. 
 
There have been several studies of the potential role of ther-
mal insulation in the achievement of these objectives. One re-
cent study (Petersdorff et al., 2002) has demonstrated that the 
technical saving potential through the more widespread use of 
thermal insulation in Europe alone is more than 350 Mtonnes 
CO2-eq/yr. This contrasts with earlier estimates (Ashford, 1998) 
which took more account of other competing measures, but 
concluded that the annual savings potential for the same region 
was 150 Mtonnes CO2-eq/yr. In any event, the role of thermal 
insulation in the future reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is 
undeniable. 
 
One of the major challenges for governments is the identi-
ﬁcation of appropriate policies and measures for implementing 
and encouraging improved energy efﬁciency in buildings. The 
construction of new buildings is typically well-regulated and 
provides a natural opportunity for increased energy efﬁciency 
standards. However, targeting new building standards alone 
will not deliver the required emissions savings, since most new 
building activity is undertaken in response to overall economic 
growth and social changes such as ageing populations and pop-
ulation migration. The daunting prospect for many governments 
is that the demolition rates for existing building stock are less 
than 0.5% per year and in some cases less than 0.2% (UNECE 
(2002) Database). Accordingly, unless there is a major demoli-
tion and rebuilding programme, the focus of attention will need 
to shift to measures required to renovate existing buildings. 
This is not easy because governments cannot generally impose 
requirements on existing owners. The problem is compounded 
because many owners are not the occupiers (or the payers of 
the energy bills), and costs and beneﬁts are therefore not linked. 
The assessment of cost-effectiveness criteria therefore becomes 
critical, with discussion focusing on matters such as investment 
costs, payback periods, discount rates and the like. In the end, 
the questions to be answered are ‘who pays?’, ‘when?’ and 
‘how much?’. Government intervention, particularly in the do-
mestic household sector, is expected to be a major part of many 
national strategies and the costs need to be considered carefully 
in order to get best value for investments (Ashford and Vetter, 
2004). 
 
In summary, it is clear that building renovation requires 
speciﬁc innovative products, supported by equally innovative 
policies and measures to improve the overall energy efﬁciency 
of existing building stock. The role of thermal insulation has 
already been highlighted by several studies, but it is anticipated 
that insulating foams will have a particularly important part to 
play because of their space-saving qualities and ease of pre-fab-
rication and/or direct application (e.g. spray foams). One of the 
purposes of this chapter is to identify the strengths and weak-
nesses of HFC-based foams and their alternatives in order to as-
sess their likely uptake and possibilities for sound management. 
This can only be done in the wider context of this over-arching 
role for energy efﬁcient products and buildings. 
 
Apart from speciﬁc insulation foams, one-component foams 
(OCF) are very widely used in the building industry as gap ﬁll-
ers around doors and windows, as well as in plumbing appli-
cations. They provide excellent seals against draughts, thereby 
reducing the heat loss or gain by the building through improved 
air-tightness. In addition, they have major economic beneﬁts 
because of their speed of application compared to any alterna-
tive method. The blowing agent acts both as a frothing agent 
and as a propellant. Initially, CFC-12 was used, but this has 
been replaced by a variety of alternatives including HCFC-22, 
hydrocarbons such as butane, propane and dimethyl ether, or 
HFC-134a and HFC-152a. This application is emissive and a 
recent European Union Proposal for a Regulation (COM (2003) 
492) will severely restrict the use of HFCs in this application 
(UNEP-FTOC, 2003).
 
Finally, insulating foam is increasingly being used in pre-in-
sulated pipes used to transport hot water underground in district 
heating systems. The foam provides the combination of thermal 
performance, moisture resistance and heat resistance required 
for this demanding environment. 
7.1.2.2 
Domestic refrigerators
The appliance market is highly competitive in all regions of the 
world and subject to stringent energy regulations in some plac-
es. The cost and performance characteristics of the insulating 
material are therefore both important parameters. Furthermore, 
the best possible insulation value is required in appliances to 
reduce wall thickness and maximize internal space, while pre-
venting the settlement which could occur with other non-foam 
insulation types. The use of polyurethane foam to insulate do-
mestic appliances started in Europe in the late 1950s as an alter-
native to mineral ﬁbre, thereby revolutionizing production and 
reducing energy consumption. The technology is now univer-
sally employed (although the transition was only completed in 
the 1990s in developing countries) and has been a key factor in 
achieving dramatic improvements in appliance efﬁciency. 
 
In response to shortages of electricity and to limit power-
plant emissions, several countries have implemented regu-
lations that require the labelling of products to indicate their 
relative energy efﬁciency, and some have established limits on 
the energy consumption allowed for refrigerators and freezers. 
Mandatory standards were implemented nationwide in the US 
in 1990. Limits were tightened in 1993, and again in 2001. In 
Europe, mandatory standards were implemented in 1999 and 
they are complemented by a progressive labelling programme. 
Several other countries have also implemented mandatory stan-
dards and labels. These standards, along with other programmes 
that provide incentives for manufacturers to design and market 
high-efﬁciency products, have resulted in thicker walls, requir-
ing more foam, and may inﬂuence the choice of foam-blowing

agent. The Appliance Research Consortium sponsored studies 
to determine the relative performance of leading candidates for 
the replacement of CFC-11 and HCFC-141b as blowing agents 
for refrigerator and freezer insulating foam. The results of these 
studies indicated that the highest insulating value was achieved 
using HFC-245fa. (Wilkes et al., 2003). In Japan, particularly 
stringent energy regulations have forced the limited introduc-
tion of vacuum panels, although cost penalties are preventing 
more widespread use. 
 
Apart from its energy contribution, the foam also provides 
strength as the core of sandwich elements, therefore reducing 
the consumption of other materials previously needed for struc-
tural purposes. An example is the use of plastic internal liners 
instead of enamelled steel, with the resulting weight reduction. 
Since the foam is important for the performance and durability 
of the product, it must maintain both its insulation effectiveness 
and structural properties throughout the design life of the appli-
ance. 
7.1.2.3 
Others
There are several additional applications in which rigid insula-
tion foams act both as an insulating medium and as a strength-
giving core material. These foams are generally polyurethane-
based, although extruded-polystyrene foams are also used. Such 
foams are universally used in refrigerated containers (reefers) 
and in truck bodies. The best possible insulation value is needed 
in these applications to reduce wall thickness and maximize in-
ternal space, while preventing the settlement that could occur 
with other non-foam insulation types.
 
Rigid polyurethane foam is used for the same efﬁciency rea-
sons in commercial refrigerator and freezer units, drink vending 
units and in domestic/commercial water heaters. The latter in 
particular are again subject to energy consumption limits. 
 
CFC-11 has been used historically in all of these poly-
urethane systems, while CFC-12 has been used in extruded-
polystyrene applications. Their main replacements globally 
have been HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b respectively. Pentane 
and HFCs are now being increasingly used as HCFC-141b is 
phased out in developed countries while, in the case of extruded 
polystyrene, HFC-134a based systems have been used to re-
place HCFC-142b owing to the high thermal insulation require-
ments.
7.1.3 
Safety/resilience
Integral skin polyurethane foams are widely used in the trans-
portation/automotive industries for in-cabin applications such 
as steering wheels, arm rests and gear shift knobs. They com-
bine aesthetics and durability with the degree of softness re-
quired to minimize impact damage in the event of an accident. 
The components are produced by a reaction injection moulding 
technique. A low percentage of blowing agent is added to give 
a solid skin and a lower density core. The mouldings are pro-
duced in both developed and developing countries. Initially, the 
blowing agent in use was CFC-11 but options include HCFCs, 
HFCs, pentane and CO2 (water). The use of HCFCs has been 
phased out in developed countries (UNEP-FTOC, 2003).
 
Closed cell polyurethane rigid and semi-rigid foams are used 
for buoyancy aids and life jackets. The buoyancy aids for boats 
are usually foamed in place. The blowing agent was initially 
CFC-11. This has been replaced with a variety of alternatives 
including HCFC-141b, and the future use of HFCs is envisaged 
(UNEP-FTOC, 2003).
7.1.4 
Comfort 
The largest polyurethane foam sector by overall volume is ﬂex-
ible foam for furniture, mattresses and transportation compo-
nents such as seats. This foam is used globally and a number 
of different blowing-agent technologies have been deployed to 
replace CFC-11, which was used initially as the auxiliary blow-
ing agent. Neither HCFCs nor HFCs are used in this sector.
 
Integral skin polyurethane foams are also used for furni-
ture components such as armrests, and for footwear, especially 
sports footwear. One of their key features is very high durability. 
The components are produced by a reaction injection moulding 
technique. A low percentage of blowing agent is added to give 
a solid skin and a lower density core. The mouldings are pro-
duced in both developed and developing countries. Initially, the 
blowing agent in use was CFC-11 but options include HCFCs, 
HFCs, pentane and CO2 (water). The use of HCFCs has been 
phased out in developed countries (UNEP-FTOC, 2003).
7.1.5 
Market growth factors 
There are three distinct factors involved in projecting market 
changes in the insulating foam sector. These can be listed as 
follows: 
(1) Overall economic activity based on GDP (as a default) or 
on the number of units being produced in a given year. 
Considering the major uses of foams, this would be the 
number of buildings built/refurbished or the number of 
appliances (e.g. domestic refrigerators or freezers) being 
manufactured. 
(2) The amount of insulation used per unit. This has tended to 
increase as energy standards for appliances have been raised 
or as building regulations have called for more insulation in 
new buildings to meet energy efﬁciency requirements. The 
expression used for this measure is the ‘foam-volume ratio’. 
Increasing energy costs can also encourage greater use of 
insulation, but the driver is relatively weak in most regions 
because energy costs have dropped in real terms over recent 
years. 
(3) The third driver for market growth in the foams sector is 
the relative share of the insulation market accounted for 
by foams. Although the trend may be in either direction 
depending on product priorities (e.g. ﬁre performance, 
thermal efﬁciency, moisture resistance), the general trend

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
in Europe over the last ten years has been moving gradually 
towards foams (see Figure 7.1). Of course, this is unlikely 
to be consistent across all foam sub-sectors or regions. 
These three factors have, in principle, constituted the overall 
market-growth drivers for the assessment of blowing-agent 
consumption from 1960 onwards. However, in practice, it has 
been more relevant to combine factors (2) and (3) into an over-
all ‘foam-volume ratio’ growth factor, since it is not normally 
possible to distinguish, at the regional level, overall insulation 
market growth ‘per unit’ from changes in market share of the 
types of insulation used.
 
For other types of non-insulating foams, the growth param-
eters are different and can be linked to indices such as global 
automobile production or fast-food sales. However, since these 
applications are unlikely ever to rely on HFCs, these parameters 
have not been considered quantitatively in this review. 
7.2 
Phase-out of ozone-depleting substances
The major classes of alternative blowing agents in use by sec-
tor are shown in Tables 7.4 and 7.5. In addition, there are a 
number of emerging blowing agents such as methyl formate 
and formic acid which are ﬁnding some acceptance. However, 
their use is not yet sufﬁciently widespread to justify inclusion 
in these tables.
7.2.1 
Transitional use of HCFCs worldwide
The use of HCFCs in foam blowing in both developed and de-
veloping countries is generally limited to insulation and integral 
skin applications. Most foams for comfort and food applications 
use HCs (extruded-polystyrene sheet and polyethylene foams), 
liquid CO2 (as a co-blowing agent) or methylene chloride (ﬂex-
ible, low-density PU foams).
7.2.1.1 
Developing Countries
HCFC-141b is the most widely used CFC substitution technol-
ogy for polyurethane foams in developing countries. The main 
reasons are the modest transition costs, easy implementation, 
similarity of end product performance (including energy) and 
wide availability. HCFC-142b and HCFC-22 are used for ex-
truded polystyrene, although the uptake of this technology is 
limited to areas where the markets are sufﬁciently large to sup-
port the capital investment. 
 
With limited further funding available to those who have 
already made the transition, HCFCs are likely to remain in 
widespread use in developing countries for a long time to come, 
possibly until 2040. This is particularly true of those who faced 
the challenge of CFC transition recently in stagnant economic 
conditions and favoured HCFCs as the most cost-effective op-
tion. Similar transition challenges face smaller enterprises in 
developed countries but, in this instance, the transition will be 
forced by regional regulation no later than 2015. 
 
Other reasons for the continued use of HCFCs vary accord-
ing to the application. The use of HCFC-141b as a blowing agent 
for the insulation of domestic refrigerators is associated with a 
potential lowering of energy consumption, which can assist in 
limiting energy demand in domestic markets where there are 
energy supply constraints. However, there may be constraints 
on trade for HCFC-containing articles in some regions (e.g. 
the European Union). Accordingly, HCFC-based technologies 
may simultaneously constitute an advantage and a disadvantage 
when multiple geographic markets are served. In summary, an 
appliance manufacturer’s decision to use HCFCs, HFCs or hy-
drocarbons depends upon power supply and use, market forces, 
and existing regulations relating to energy and ozone-depleting 
substances in the targeted countries.
  
Similar considerations apply to sectors such as commercial 
refrigeration and other insulation applications. It is important to 
bear in mind that most industrial CFC conversions ﬁnanced by 
the Multilateral Fund could use equipment that supports non-
HCFC technologies such as CO2 (water) and hydrocarbons. 
However, the degree of penetration of hydrocarbon technolo-
gies has been limited by the availability of hydrocarbons of an 
appropriate quality and by investment thresholds that set a cap 
on the funding available to save a kilogram of CFC. 
 
HFCs, HCFCs, carbon dioxide (water) and HCs are current-
ly used for automotive integral skin applications in developing 
countries in response to customer requirements, corporate poli-
cies or both.
 
In the case of extruded polystyrene, developing countries 
installing new capacity are likely to use HCFCs (HCFC-142b 
and/or HCFC-22) because HCFC equipment remains readily 
available and little equipment is available as yet for the installa-
tion of turnkey operations capable of using blowing agents with 
zero ozone-depleting potential. 
 
In summary, as long as HCFCs remain available, HCs and 
HFCs will be used by developing countries only as widely as 
the additional costs associated with these technologies can be 
afforded or where corporate policy dictates. Some further ratio-

nalization of HCFC usage patterns may be required post-2015 
to comply with the anticipated freeze in consumption under the 
Montreal Protocol. The maturity of alternative technologies and 
conversion costs are likely to be decisive factors in prioritizing 
further substitution. 
7.2.1.2 
Developed Countries
In developed countries, ongoing HCFC use in polyurethane ap-
plications is limited to the smaller contractors (e.g. those apply-
ing spray foam). HCFCs also continue to be used for extruded 
polystyrene, particularly in North America. These uses are still 
in line with the Montreal Protocol. However, in some regions 
(e.g. the European Union), HCFCs have been phased out early 
and replaced by hydrocarbons, HFCs (HFC-134a, HFC-152a, 
HFC-245fa and HFC-365mfc/HFC-227ea blends) or CO2-
based blowing-agent systems, where these are appropriate. The 
approach adopted by different countries varies signiﬁcantly, 
with some governments pursuing bans on use in speciﬁc foam 
sub-sectors, and others pursuing either a substance-based ap-
proach or relying on the Montreal Protocol timetable to ratchet 
down supply. There are often combinations of any two of these 
approaches and, sometimes, even all three. Although there have 
been regional difﬁculties, reductions in HCFC use are occur-
ring in most developed countries. There is a slight complication, 
however, with the potential import of polyurethane systems 
containing HCFCs when developing countries are the source, 
since these are not discouraged by the Montreal Protocol itself.

7.2.2 
CO2 (including CO2 (water))
CO2 and CO2 (water) are widely used as blowing agents in many 
non-insulating polyurethane foam sectors. These include ﬂex-
ible slabstock, moulded foam for transportation, footwear and 
integral skin foams for transport and furniture applications. In 
many cases, this blowing-agent technology has been the direct 
replacement for CFC-11.
 
This technology is not widely used for insulating poly-
urethane foams since it gives a lower thermal performance. 
However, there is emerging work in Japan (Ohnuma and Mori, 
2003) on the potential use of super-critical CO2 for some poly-
urethane spray foam formulations. The commercialization of 
this technology is being monitored closely, but most recent re-
ports suggest that some subsidy for equipment investment may 
be required to stimulate market acceptance. 
 
As a sole blowing agent or in conjunction with co-blow-
ing agents (ethanol, hydrocarbons, acetone, isopropanol, wa-
ter), CO2 is principally used in XPS (extruded polystyrene) in 
regions which have already chosen to phase out HCFCs, and 
where the market considers the loss in thermal efﬁciency to be 
offset by the other inherent properties of XPS boards (moisture 
resistance, mechanical strength, compressive strength, dimen-
sional stability and resistance to freeze-thaw deterioration). 
Higher densities or lower conversion may partially or wholly 
offset the low cost of CO2 itself in some XPS applications. 
Furthermore, the use of CO2-based blowing-agent systems is 
technically challenging, and not suitable for many existing 
manufacturing lines, particularly where such lines require sub-
stantial investment. These considerations put the technology 
out of reach for many small and medium enterprises.
 
Nevertheless, the use of CO2-based technology for XPS is 
likely to continue to grow as long as the cost of alternative HFC 
solutions remains high.
7.2.3 
Hydrocarbons
In rigid polyurethane insulating foams, the use of cyclopentane 
and various isomers of pentane to replace ﬂuorocarbons has 
very rapidly gained wide acceptance in all regions. For building 
applications, normal pentane is the most widely used isomer. 
Normal pentane and cyclopentane/isopentane blends are typi-
cally used in rigid polyisocyanurate insulating foams in North 
America. In domestic refrigerators and freezers, cyclopentane 
was introduced in Europe in 1993 and it has gained acceptance 
in all regions except the USA, where existing VOC-emission 
regulations and stringent ﬁre safety codes make the conversion 
of existing facilities uneconomical. The technology has been re-
ﬁned and optimized for cost-effectiveness and a blend of cyclo-
pentane/isopentane is gaining prominence. Despite the higher 
thermal conductivity compared to foams based on HCFC-141b 
or HFC-245fa, appliances based on the hydrocarbon option at-
tain the highest A+ energy efﬁciency category under the EU’s 
stringent requirements. The technology provides good process-
ing and other foam characteristics. The safety precautions for 
processing this ﬂammable blowing agent are also well estab-
lished. However, the cost of the necessary safety measures and 
the management infrastructure required can be uneconomical 
for small enterprises.
 
For rigid XPS insulation foams, hydrocarbons can be used 
as co-blowing agents with either CO2- or HFC-based systems. 
Typically based on isomers of butanes or pentanes, they pro-

vide processability and in some cases contribute to the insula-
tion value of the foams. The use of these ﬂammable blowing 
agents is, however, limited due to their adverse inﬂuence on 
ﬁre performance. Nonetheless, there is considerable uptake in 
Japan, where speciﬁc ﬁre test conﬁgurations support the blow-
ing agent’s use. 
7.2.4 
HFCs
HFCs have been under consideration as replacements for 
HCFCs since the early 1990s. However, the absence of materi-
als with an appropriate boiling point initially limited the poten-
tial for their use to gaseous processes such as those processes 
used to manufacture XPS (HFC-134a, HFC-152a). More re-
cently, the development and commercialization of HFC-245fa 
and HFC-365mfc has enabled a wider range of processes to 
be encompassed by HFC technologies. However, the price of 
HFCs (particularly the newer materials) has ensured that HFCs 
are only used where they are perceived to be absolutely nec-
essary – most notably where product liability, process safety 
and/or thermal performance beneﬁts are evident. 
 
As a consequence, it is now estimated that global HFC con-
sumption in the foam sector is unlikely to exceed 75,000 tonnes 
annually in the period to 2015. This represents around 20% of 
the consumption that would have been associated with CFCs 
in the absence of the Montreal Protocol and around 50% of the 
uptake anticipated when the situation was ﬁrst reviewed at the 
Petten Conference in 1999.
 
However, cost is a complex component, since it can be ap-
plied at both bulk substance level and at system formulation 
level. Box 7.1 illustrates the point.
7.3 
Foam sub-sector analysis
7.3.1 
Selecting blowing agents in applications where 
HFCs are considered
7.3.1.1 
Thermal insulation foam
Building (polyurethane, phenolic, extruded polystyrene)
The construction industry is very cost-competitive and the use 
of HFCs in polyurethane rigid foams will naturally be restricted 
to those applications and circumstances where other blowing 
agents are unsuitable because of safety or performance fac-
tors. It is likely that the largest sector using HFCs will be the 
spray foam industry, because of safety constraints on the use of 
pentane and the product performance limitations (thermal con-
ductivity and density) when using CO2 (water). Another major 
sector, and one where small and medium enterprises are heavily 
involved, is the production of discontinuous sandwich panels. 
Here again, HFCs are expected to be the major blowing agent 
because of the high costs of ﬂame-prooﬁng such equipment for 
the use of HCs. The adoption of HFCs will only occur in the 
larger boardstock or continuously-produced sandwich panel 
sectors, where the end product has to meet very stringent ﬂam-
mability speciﬁcations. Although foams based on HFCs typi-
cally display superior insulation properties per unit thickness, 
this is only likely to be a decisive factor where there are sig-
niﬁcant space limitations2. One such sector may be the strategi-
cally important renovation market. 
 
Box 7.2 illustrates the signiﬁcance of different approaches 
to comparing thermal insulation and, in particular, the effect on 
lifetime CO2 emissions of selecting different insulation materi-
als with a constant thickness. 
 
For phenolic systems used in the continuous boardstock sec-
tor and the discontinuous block and panel sectors, the consid-
erations are very similar. However, because of the intrinsic ﬁre 
properties of the foam matrix, the use of hydrocarbons has been 
found to be more feasible (c.f. progress in Japan with isobutane) 
than had been originally anticipated for foams used typically in 
ﬁre-sensitive applications. A further factor inﬂuencing the non-
selection of HFCs as blowing agents is the fact that phenolic 
chemistry does not offer the co-blowing options available to 
polyurethane systems. Accordingly, the blowing-agent compo-
nent of formulations can be in excess of 10% in some instances, 
with signiﬁcant cost implications. Nonetheless, the use of HFCs 
(particularly HFC-365mfc/HFC-227ea blends) is expected con-
tinue in a signiﬁcant proportion of the phenolic foam market for 
the foreseeable future, particularly if ﬁre performance standards 
continue to become more stringent, as is currently the case in 
Europe. 
 
As with rigid polyurethane foams, the use of HFCs in rigid 
extruded polystyrene foams tends to be restricted to circum-
stances where other blowing agents are unsuitable (because of 
safety, processability and/or performance), as their price makes 
them too costly for many market segments. Systems based prin-
cipally on HFC-134a can match HCFC-142b thermal conduc-
tivity, and are used in applications where insulation value and/
or space are at a premium. HFC-134a is also long lived in the 
foam and provides excellent insulation performance over time 
(Vo and Paquet, 2004), making it suitable for applications with 
long lifetimes. HFC-152a, on the other hand, leaves the foam 
fairly quickly, but has improved processability. This makes it 
easier to use for the creation of large cross-sections, where the 
use of CO2- or HFC-134a-based systems are technically chal-
lenging and beyond the capabilities of many small and medium 
enterprises today. 
Appliances
Because of the challenging insulation and structural character-
istics required for refrigerator and freezer insulation, no proven 
not-in-kind technologies are available at present that can meet 
all the requirements. Vacuum insulation panels have been used 
(as a supplement to the insulating foam) in limited quantities 
and are increasingly being used in critical locations in cabinets 
in Japan. However, high costs continue to limit their use to ap-
plications where thermal performance is of paramount impor-

deﬁne the ageing characteristics of the foams as required by CEN standards.

tance. Polyurethane foam therefore continues to be used for the 
bulk of this application.
 
Although hydrocarbons are being successfully used as the 
blowing agent for refrigerator and freezer production in most 
regions of the world, there are some situations, most notably in 
North America, where manufacturers have chosen HFCs as the 
preferred replacement for ozone-depleting substances in this 
application. Their reasoning is that HFCs can provide the supe-
rior insulation performance needed to meet existing, stringent, 
energy standards while meeting customer demand for storage 
capacity, product dimensions and cost. Using HFCs as blow-
ing agents also precludes the need for the prohibitively large 
investments needed to meet stringent safety codes and VOC-
emission regulations in existing facilities. These considerations 
can outweigh the advantage of lower material costs and lower 
direct GWP associated with the hydrocarbon alternatives. The 
use of HFCs as blowing agents for refrigerator foam was minor 
prior to 2003. However, it has since increased signiﬁcantly in 
North America as HCFC-141b has been replaced, and may also 
increase in some other regions as HCFCs are ultimately phased 
out (UNEP-FTOC, 2003). The primary HFC used in North 
America is HFC-245fa.
 
With respect to the global warming implications of this 
choice, analyses of total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) 
and life cycle climate performance (LCCP) have indicated that, 
because of the superior insulating and ageing characteristics 
Box 7.1. Relationship between blowing-agent cost and foam cost
The thermal insulation market is a complex competitive environment but, in common with most suppliers to the construction 
industry, cost pressures in the insulation sector are ever-present. These pressures apply to all insulation types and the major 
driver is often the cost per unit of thermal resistance provided.
The blowing agent for thermal insulating foams is usually a signiﬁcant contributor to thermal performance (Vo and 
Paquet, 2004). A more expensive blowing agent can therefore be justiﬁed if the beneﬁt in thermal resistance can offset 
the additional cost. This has often been the case in traditional uses of CFCs. While more expensive than hydrocarbons 
and other alternatives, they provided cost-effective insulation because thinner boards could be used. Although the thermal 
performance of HCFC blown foams was initially slightly worse than their CFC blown equivalents (UNEP-FTOC, 1995) 
system improvements soon restored parity after the transition from CFCs (UNEP-FTOC, 1999). However, this was in a 
situation where HCFCs were trading at prices similar to traditional CFC levels. 
For blowing agents with signiﬁcantly higher prices, such as HFCs, there is no obvious way to provide a competitive 
insulation product in highly cost-sensitive markets other than reducing the amount of expensive blowing agent used 
(e.g. by using a blend with hydrocarbon) or reducing overall foam density without affecting the product properties (e.g. 
compressive strength). In practice, there is no easy route to lower-density products with the same performance levels. 
However, co-blowing with CO2 (water) has been an option for several HFC-based technologies, albeit with some upper 
limits imposed by the performance requirements of the product.
In a traditional foam formulation (e.g. with HCFC-141b), blowing-agent levels of between 6% and 12% by weight are the 
norm. In the case of polyurethane foam blown with 8% blowing agent, the following scenario could be envisaged: 
 
Polyurethane chemical costs  
 D1500 /tonne
 
Blowing-agent (1) cost 
 D1000 /tonne
 
Blowing-agent (2) cost 
 D4000/tonne
With an 8% loading and 32 kg/m3 density, the change in blowing agent from (1) to (2) would push up the cost of foam by 
15%. However, if it were possible to reduce the expensive blowing-agent loading to 4% by co-blowing with CO2 (water), 
the impact on cost would drop below 10%. These apparently small adjustments have been demonstrated to be critical in the 
competitive market place and the prudent use of expensive blowing agents has resulted in a reduction in the predicted uptake 
of HFCs worldwide. 
Of course, there are insulation foam applications where the market is less sensitive to blowing-agent cost. This is particularly 
the case when a speciﬁc blowing-agent choice makes it possible to adopt a more economic building solution. This can be 
the case in some renovation markets as well as for exposed foam products such as pipe insulation.

when using HFC-245fa, the use of an HFC blowing agent can 
be at least neutral in most markets, or even beneﬁcial when 
compared to the use of a hydrocarbon blowing agent (Johnson, 
2004). 
Some other appliances also rely on the insulation and struc-
tural beneﬁts of insulating foam. Water heaters and commer-
cial refrigerators and freezers (including display units), along 
with insulated picnic boxes (or coolers) and various ﬂasks and 
thermoware, are substantial markets in this sector. The require-
ments and options are generally similar to those for domestic 
refrigerators and freezers. However, in some cases, the space 
requirements are not as stringent. The average operating tem-
perature for water heaters is higher than for refrigerators and 
freezers and, at these temperatures, the energy disadvantage of 
hydrocarbon blowing agents is not signiﬁcant. Most manufac-
turers are therefore using hydrocarbons or CO2 (from water) 
in such applications as substitutes with zero ozone-depleting 
potential.

Product and process safety
Process Safety Issues: Toxicity and Flammability
The production and use of foams involve important safety con-
siderations. These often play a role at the manufacturing stage 
and include worker exposure and ﬂammability issues. 
 
In ﬂexible polyurethane foams, a technically suitable al-
ternative to CFC-11 as an auxiliary blowing agent is methy-
lene chloride (dichloromethane). However, it is classiﬁed as 
Carcinogen category 3 in the EU and OSHA has established 
exposure standards in the USA. Nevertheless, HFCs are not 
Box 7.2. Choosing insulation for new building projects 
The choice of insulation type can be impacted by many factors, including long-term thermal performance, efﬁcient utilisation 
of space, cost and ease of installation. For most new buildings, a minimum energy performance is required for the building 
fabric (usually stated in terms of U-value or R-value). All insulation types can normally meet this minimum standard, but 
different thicknesses will often be required. Where space is constrained (constant thickness), this can pose a problem and 
energy penalties can be paid as shown below. 
 
However, where constant U-value can be maintained, blowing-agent choice is often the decisive factor. The graph illustrates 
the impact on total CO2-equivalent savings of different loss assumptions for an HFC blowing agent. The impact of this direct 
emission is usually greater than any embodied energy consideration if any signiﬁcant blowing-agent losses occur during the 
production, use or decommissioning of the foam. 
Since the given parameters (e.g. thickness constraint) vary according to the application, it is vitally important that such 
an analysis is carried out on an application-by-application basis rather than at product level in order to make the most 
appropriate decision. Where the level of insulation permitted is generally low, the differences in overall lifetime CO2 savings 
can be substantial between different insulation materials.

Box 7.3. LCCP analysis results for a refrigerator
A summary of the results of an LCCP analysis conducted on a European refrigerator is shown here. The two products 
compared were identical in all respects, except for the blowing agent (BA), which was HFC-245fa in one product and a 
cyclo/iso-pentane blend in the other product. This analysis assumed that 90% of the blowing agent would be recovered or 
destroyed at end of life by processing refrigerators in appropriate facilities as required by EU directives. In the table below, 
a second column was added, extending the analysis to include a case where only 50% of the remaining blowing agent was 
recovered or destroyed at end of life. Note the dominance of the CO2 emissions due to energy consumption of the product in 
both cases. Emissions are in kg CO2 equivalent.

The analysis was extended to cases in which it was assumed that the product was used in several different regions of the 
world. Note that the net global warming impact is lower for the HFC-245fa product in all regions considered, except Brazil 
(where most of the power is from hydroelectric sources). In this analysis, it was assumed that 90% of decommissioned 
refrigerators in Europe would be recycled, with recovery or destruction of the blowing agent. The levels of recycling or 
destruction assumed for other countries were 50% for Australia, New Zealand, and the US; 95% for Japan; and 20% for 
China, India, and Brazil.

considered to be alternatives to methylene chloride in this ap-
plication (UNEP-FTOC, 2003).
 
The use of hydrocarbons in foam manufacture can be a ma-
jor issue. The use of pentane for rigid polyurethane and poly-
isocyanurate foams has required signiﬁcant re-engineering of 
production sites, as well as worker training to prevent explosive 
mixtures occurring. Although these investments can be amor-
tized quickly over a large production volume in the larger en-
terprises, the conversion cost can be prohibitive for small and 
medium enterprises in both developed and developing coun-
tries. The safety record for the use of pentane has been good 
for over ten years and there have been very few incidents. By 
contrast, the use of highly ﬂammable blowing agents in the ex-
truded-polystyrene sheet sector to replace CFC-12 has resulted 
in several incidents, especially in developing countries. In the 
extruded-polystyrene-foam board sector, handling improve-
ments in, for example, Japan and Europe have resulted in the 
use of such ﬂammable mixtures without incident (UNEP-
FTOC, 2003). Signiﬁcant concern exists in Europe and other 
areas about the safety of hydrocarbons in applications involving 
the use of polyurethane spray foam (Box 7.4).
 
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in both developed and 
developing countries can have particular difﬁculty with han-
dling hydrocarbons. Whilst the unit costs and operating costs 
associated with hydrocarbons are low, the capital costs in-
volved in converting manufacturing plants to comply with na-
tional regulations for the handling of ﬂammable blowing agents 
may be prohibitive, particularly for SMEs in developed coun-
tries where no ﬁnancial support is available. Even in developing 
countries, the Multilateral Fund limits the grant available for 
conversion by the adoption of a funding threshold, often leav-
Box 7.4. Process safety and renovation: The example of polyurethane spray foam in Spain 
Although work continues on the safe use of hydrocarbon systems in polyurethane (PU) spray foams, the current commercial 
reality in Spain is that the only viable alternatives to HCFC-based systems for closed cell insulating foams are HFC-based. 
This has resulted in the need for well-coordinated transition programmes, not all of which have proceeded smoothly. Spray 
foam systems provide unique opportunities for the renovation of buildings, particularly roofs in both the residential and 
commercial/industrial sectors. The building style in Spain and other Southern European countries lends itself to the use of 
PU spray foam for upgrading the insulation of ﬂat roofs. The key advantage is that there is no need to ‘tear off’ the existing 
roof material prior to the application of spray foam. This has a critical impact in the installed cost of a re-insulated roof, as 
shown in the table below:

Mineral wool 
 
D 49.20
 
Extruded polystyrene (CO2 blown)

D 47.16
In Spain, very few houses built prior to 1979 have any signiﬁcant insulation in them. The estimated number of houses in this 
category is around 7.3 million. The policy objective of the Spanish government is understood as the renovation of at least 
5% of this total between 2005 and 2012 (Energy Efﬁciency & Economy Strategy 2004–2012 – Buildings Sector E4 Working 
Document, July 2003). If the rate of renovation is constant, this will equate to just over 45,000 houses per year. 
The budget set aside for the improvement of the building fabric (both residential and commercial/industrial) is D 2,780 
million, although this will include the installation of new glazing and other fabric measures. This represents an average 
investment allocation of just over D 30 per m2. If the roofs of 45,000 houses per year were re-insulated with PU spray foam, 
the overall cost of the work, assuming an average roof size of 100m2, would be D 776 million (i.e. 28% of the total budget). 
This seems a reasonable proportion of funds to be allocated for this purpose bearing in mind the resulting CO2 saving. 
However, if other insulation technologies were used as an alternative to PU spray foam, either the percentage of the total 
budget allocated to roof renovation would need to be increased to more than 50% of the total budget, thereby forfeiting other 
options, or the rooﬁng area insulated per year would be less. The ﬁgure in this box illustrates the impact, given a constant 
budget allocation (28%), on CO2 savings in lifecycle terms of the application of the different technologies. The lifetime of 
any roof renovation measure is assumed to be 15 years, given the durability of the waterproof membranes used, and it is the 
same for all options.

ing the enterprise signiﬁcantly short of funding for a hydrocar-
bon route. Within the MLF system, hydrocarbons only become 
viable when the CFC-11 consumption reaches about 50 tonnes 
per annum. Smaller enterprises may therefore be obliged to use 
HFCs (or more likely HCFCs) despite their negative impact 
on operating costs and, potentially, the environment (UNEP-
FTOC, 2003). In addition, the rigorous operating procedures 
required to store, handle and process ﬂammable blowing agents 
safely may prove too much of a challenge for many SMEs, par-
ticularly in developing countries. 
Product safety issues: End-product Fire Performance and 
Integral Skin Quality
The use of a ﬂammable blowing agent can also have an effect 
on the ﬁre properties of the end product. This is particularly 
important in the building/construction sector. Some of the most 
stringent ﬁre product safety standards are not yet being met by 
hydrocarbon technology and the use of HFCs is envisaged for 
these applications (UNEP-FTOC, 2003). 
 
There are other safety reasons why blowing-agent choice 
can be important. For example, in integral skin foams for the 
automotive sector, the combination of skin quality and impact 
absorbency is critical for steering wheel and facia applications. 
The use of in-mould coatings has been one approach used to 
combat the poorer quality skins created by some alternatives. 
However, there are drawbacks to this approach in terms of costs 
and processing. In some applications, HFCs are being used to 
produce skin quality more comparable with that once attained 
with CFCs and HCFCs. 
7.3.2 
Introduction to tables
Table 7.6 and 7.7 are intended to provide a reliable overview 
of the issues affecting the selection of insulation materials and, 
in particular, blowing agents. The tables are believed to be suf-
ﬁciently comprehensive to provide sound guidance. However, 
the format does not lend itself to detailed reasoning in all cases. 
Accordingly, the reader is encouraged to refer to relevant text 
elsewhere in the chapter or to seek advice from sector experts if 
the information available requires further clariﬁcation or quali-
ﬁcation. 
Box 7.4. Continued
Figure Box 7.4. Cumulative renovation programme savings – ﬁve-year intervals [Insert from o/leaf]
The use of PU Spray foam involves the direct emission of HFCs (15%) during application, with the result that the CO2 
savings during the eight-year implementation period of the programme are offset, making them lower than for the other 
options. However, in the subsequent seven-year period, the increased market penetration of PU spray foam in the constant 
budget scenario makes the delivery of overall savings much more efﬁcient. In the Spanish case, the prediction is that more 
than an additional 1 Mtonnes of CO2 would be saved during the lifetime of the measures. These are important additional 
savings for a government faced with signiﬁcant greenhouse-gas emission challenges and they explain why the Spanish are 
keen to see the retention of the HFC-based PU spray technology option.

7.3.3 
Summary of key themes
(1) The reasons given for the use of HFCs in Section 7.3.1 are 
replicated by sub-sector in the table. 
They can be summarized as follows: 
• better thermal performance, leading to enhanced capabilities 
in space-constrained environments;
• compliance with product ﬁre classiﬁcations in applications 
and regions sensitive to ‘reaction-to-ﬁre’ issues;
• minimization of risks in processing, particularly when risks 
cannot be speciﬁcally addressed by engineered solutions or 
when costs are prohibitive (e.g. SMEs);
• cost-effective application options, particularly important in 
the building renovation sector where costs may determine 
whether insulation is applied at all.
(2) Drawbacks to using HFCs remain: 
• concerns about the ability to demonstrate objectively the 
environmental neutrality or beneﬁt of using an HFC option, 
particularly for building applications;
• stakeholder concern about the growth of HFC use;
• cost implications of using HFCs in highly competitive 
markets where there is little, if any, return on the 
investment. 
(3) Once an HFC technology has been selected, there are sev-
eral strategies for minimizing emissions: 
• optimization of the formulation to minimize HFC use (e.g. 
by using co-blowing agents); 
• design of the product for low blowing-agent losses during 
the long use phase;
• design of the product for ease of processing at end of life 
(e.g. through greater use of pre-fabricated elements).
7.4 
Blowing agents: use patterns and emissions 
7.4.1 
Quantifying consumption and establishing 
business as usual (BAU)
The anticipated growth drivers for foam use were discussed in 
Section 7.1.5. The three main growth factors driving foam use 
can be summarized as: 
1. overall economic activity;
2. insulation usage per unit of activity (i.e. energy standards or 
costs);
3. changes in the respective market shares of foams and ﬁbrous 
insulation.
Blowing-agent selection can have an inﬂuence on at least the 
two latter factors listed, as described explicitly in the sub-sec-
tor analysis. The summary of ‘key themes’ speciﬁcally explain 
the reasons why HFCs might be used. These include thermal 
performance, product/process safety and cost. It is important to 
note that cost appears as both a positive and a negative driver in 
terms of HFC selection, reﬂecting the fact that, in deﬁned ap-
plications, HFC use can have speciﬁc cost and environmental 
beneﬁts, even though the basic cost of the HFC and its global 
warming potential would intuitively indicate otherwise. An ad-
ditional factor with a potentially signiﬁcant effect on use pat-
terns is local regulation. However, one of the challenging as-
pects of determining the impact of such regulation is that most 
potential legislation is still in the future and the full implica-
tions on HCFC substitution are still to emerge. Accordingly, in 
the absence of detailed information, future regulatory impacts 
cannot therefore be considered to be part of the BAU scenario. 
 
One-component foams have been a particularly high-pro-
ﬁle use of HFCs (indeed, the primary use) in foams over re-
cent years. Since OCFs are totally emissive in their application, 
the impact on short-term HFC emission assessments has been 
profound. However, alternative technologies do exist and have 
only been limited in their market penetration by initial safety 
concerns. It seems fairly certain that HFC use in this sector will 
be phased out within the next ten years, and the current draft EU 
regulation on ﬂuorinated gases reﬂects this reality. Accordingly, 
this eventuality is included in the BAU case. Nonetheless, it is 
worth noting in passing that the role of one-component foams 
in improving the air tightness of buildings is possibly one of the 
largest single potential contributors to overall energy efﬁciency 
improvement. 
 
For insulating foams themselves, the situation with respect 
to HFC usage for the European Polyurethane Foam industry is 
covered by Jeffs et al. (2004). Similar tables have been generated 
for the ten other regions of the world on the basis of the assess-
ment carried out by the Foams Technical Options Committee 
(UNEP-FTOC, 2003). These have been further developed to 
account for all fourteen identiﬁed blowing-agent types in the 
insulated foam sector (Ashford et al., 2004ab). These are shown 
in Table 7.8.
 
The resulting assessment of the global consumption of 
blowing agent is shown in the Figure 7.2, which illustrates the 
overall growth in consumption for the period to 2015 and how 
the newer blowing-agent options (HCs and HFCs) are replac-
ing the ozone-depleting substances used previously (CFCs and 
HCFCs).
 
To generate substance-speciﬁc assessments, assumptions 
about the split between HFC-245fa usage and HFC-365mfc 
usage in competing markets are required. They have been 
made possible, at least in part, by the patent situation in North 
Table 7.8. Identiﬁed blowing agents in the insulated foam sector.

America, where the use of HFC-365mfc has been de facto pre-
vented by the decision of the sole licence holder to focus en-
tirely on HFC-245fa. This has further implications for the use 
of HFC-227ea in foam applications since it is used exclusively 
in blends with HFC-365mfc within the foam sector. 
 
An additional element of uncertainty is the split between 
n-pentane, iso-pentane and cyclo-pentane usage in the hydro-
carbon-based sector of the market. Where speciﬁc regional in-
formation is available, this has been included in the models. 
However, for the most part, assumptions have been made based 
on practices in other regions or similar usage sectors. In any 
event, the total hydrocarbon emissions and banks are unaf-
fected by this approach and the uncertainty has little impact on 
greenhouse-gas emission assessments.
7.4.2 
Discussion of business-as-usual scenarios 
Overall HFC usage
At the Petten Conference (Ashford, 1999), it was estimated that 
the global uptake of HFCs in foams would be around 75,000 
tonnes by 2004, with further growth to 115,000 tonnes in 2010. 
This was also reﬂected in emissions estimates for Europe at 
that time of 13 Mtonnes CO2-eq (March, 1998). Since then, 
however, it has become increasingly apparent that the cost of 
the relevant HFCs has driven a high level of innovation for 
alternatives and, in particular, blends which make best use of 
HFC properties without being totally reliant upon them (e.g. 
co-blowing with CO2 (water) for spray foam applications in 
the United States). The resulting estimate for 2010 is now ap-
proximately 57,000 tonnes, rising to just under 73,000 tonnes 
by 2015, and the re-appraisal of European emissions to below 
10 Mtonnes CO2-eq (Preamble to draft EU F-Gas Regulation, 
European Commission (2003)) is a further reﬂection of this re-
alignment. 
Ongoing HCFC usage in developed and developing countries
As a result of Montreal Protocol controls, the use of CFCs has 
dropped from more than 75,000 ODP tonnes in 1995 to around 
10,000 ODP tonnes in 2002. The use of CFC blowing agents 
in developing countries is declining, but is likely to continue 
until 2005–2008. According to the TEAP HCFC Task Force 
Report (UNEP-TEAP, 2003), HCFCs are likely to play a con-
tinued role as ‘transitional substances’ in insulating and in inte-
gral skin foams. HCFC-141b is the most widely used blowing 
agent in the foam sector, with global demand at approximately 
110,000 tonnes in 2001. Because it is banned for use in foams or 
scheduled for imminent phase-out in most developed countries, 
HCFC-141b consumption will drop signiﬁcantly to approxi-
mately 28,000 tonnes in 2003–2004. However, HCFC-141b 
will still be considered a viable replacement for CFCs in devel-
oping countries and demand is expected to increase steadily to 
approximately 40,000 tonnes by 2015. 
 
In the foam sector, demand for HCFC-142b and HCFC-22 
is signiﬁcantly lower than demand for HCFC-141b. Global 
demand for HCFC-142b was approximately 24,000 tonnes in 
2001. That same year, global demand for HCFC-22 was approx-
imately 9,000 tonnes. The demand for HCFC-142b is primarily 
based on the production of extruded-polystyrene foam in North 
America and Japan. HCFC-22 is also used, to a lesser degree, 
in polystyrene- and polyurethane-foam applications in North 
America. With the exception of HCFC-22 in Latin America, 
HCFC-142b and HCFC-22 consumption in developing coun-
tries is very low, although some use of HCFC-22 is occurring 
as a blend with HCFC-141b in integral skin foams. Once these 
chemicals are phased out in the foam sector in North America

(2010), their combined consumption in foams is expected to be 
less than 1,000 tonnes and to remain close to or below that level 
until 2015.
 
One of the key factors in deﬁning the business-as-usual 
scenario related to the percentage of the phase-out of extruded 
polystyrene in the US foam sector in 2010 that would be depen-
dent on the uptake of HFCs. This remains an extraordinarily 
difﬁcult parameter to predict and a reasonably conservative es-
timate of 65% has therefore been adopted. 
 
Finally, the business-as-usual scenario needs to address 
HFC demand assumptions beyond 2015 in order to establish 
a complete picture of the likely emissions scenario over the 
full lifecycle (up to 50 years) of foam products manufactured 
and installed in the period through to 2015. Beyond 2015, it is 
known that HCFC consumption in developing countries will 
be frozen under the Montreal Protocol and will be phased out 
by 2040. Accordingly, it is assumed that the decline is linear 
between 2030 and 2040. For HFC use beyond 2015, there is 
less certainty, but the degree of innovation that has marked the 
last 20 years would suggest that the foam industry is unlikely to 
be reliant on HFCs beyond 2030. Accordingly, the business-as-
usual analysis proposes a freeze in consumption at 2015 levels 
and a linear decline in use between 2020 and 2030. 
7.4.3 
Business-as-usual emission projections and 
existing uncertainties
The development of interest in blowing-agent emissions from 
the foam sector was initially driven from within the Montreal 
Protocol process. Although this protocol operates in legal terms 
on a ‘production/consumption’ basis, the parties have never 
lost sight of the fact that three of the central clauses of the pre-
amble to the protocol refer explicitly to controlling emissions 
(UNEP, 2003). Given this background, the parties have tended 
to encourage the technical and economic review of methods for 
reducing emissions from end uses involving ozone-depleting 
substances. In two key areas – refrigeration and foams – these 
opportunities are particularly signiﬁcant because of the encap-
sulation and delayed release of the respective refrigerants and 
blowing agents. In promoting the consideration of these op-
tions, the protocol has been very careful not to mandate such 
emission reduction strategies, recognizing that these decisions 
are for individual parties or groups of parties. 
 
The UNEP Foams Technical Options Committee (UNEP-
FTOC, 1999) and, more latterly, the Task Force on Collection, 
Recovery and Long-term Storage (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab) have 
addressed the issue of release proﬁles from foams. These have 
formed the basis for more recent modelling work (Ashford et 
al., 2004ab). However, efforts continue to be made to update 
speciﬁc emission functions where new evidence supports such 
revision (see Table 7.7 for the latest emission functions). The 
recent work of the extruded-polystyrene industry has been par-
ticularly noteworthy in this respect (Vo and Paquet, 2004; Lee 
and Mutton, 2004). This assessment has re-evaluated emission 
losses during the use phase of extruded polystyrene at 0.75% 
per annum against a previous estimate of 2.5% per annum. 
 
Figure 7.3 emerges from the adoption of these emission 
functions for the business-as-usual scenario and the most recent 
scientiﬁc values for GWPs presented in Chapter 2. 
 
Some signiﬁcant trends emerge. The increased CFC emis-
sions peak in the period between 2030 and 2050 reﬂects the im-
pact of decommissioning CFC-containing products from build-
ings. The business-as-usual scenario does not envisage any 
recovery of the blowing agent from these sources. However, 
the continuation of CFC emissions beyond 2050 illustrates that 
considerable levels of CFCs are expected to be re-banked in 
landﬁll sites (other end-of-life options include re-use, shredding 
without blowing agent recovery and shredding with blowing 
agent recovery). The assumption in the case of landﬁll is that 
the initial losses from foams are not excessive. Work carried out 
by the Danish Technical University on losses from refrigerator 
foam during shredding and landﬁll suggests overall losses in the 
range of 20% (Scheutz and Kjeldsen, 2001). At ﬁrst sight, this 
seems low. However, if one takes into consideration the ﬁne-
celled structure of these foams and the fact that some blowing 
agent is often dissolved in the matrix, it becomes more reason-
able to assume losses of this order for most landﬁll processes. 
In cases where car shredders are used, there is a third potential 
factor, since the foam particles generated through such shred-
ders tend to be ‘ﬁst-sized’ and do not represent a substantial in-
crease in surface area to volume. This contrasts with European 
and Japanese shredders, which are designed to maximize sur-
face area and encourage the release of blowing agent under 
controlled conditions. The ‘ﬁst-sized’ pieces are more likely 
to mirror the type of debris obtained from building demolition 
processes and it is for this reason that the parallel is drawn for 
modeling purposes. The assumption, however, involves a high 
level of sensitivity. Figure 7.4 illustrates this sensitivity by con-
sidering what the emissions forecast would look like if, in a 
worst-case scenario, 100% of blowing agent was emitted at the 
Figure 7.3. Business-as-usual emissions by blowing-agent type for the 
period 1990–2100

time of landﬁll. 
 
This scenario, of course, means that the impact of blowing-
agent emissions would be more concentrated and more severe 
during the period from 2030 to 2050. The uncertainty also indi-
cates the need for further work in this area. What the adoption 
of a relatively conservative loss rate for landﬁll does ensure, 
however, is that any predicted savings from end-of-life mea-
sures are also conservative. The reality is probably somewhere 
in between. 
 
Assuming the CFCs get there, consideration must be given 
to the potential for anaerobic degradation in the accumulated 
CFC banks in landﬁlls. The work of Scheutz, Fredenslund and 
Kjeldsen (2003) revealed the potential for both CFC-11 and 
CFC-12 breakdown in managed landﬁll environments. The 
believed need for ‘management’ places this potential emission 
reduction factor somewhere between a business-as-usual uncer-
tainty and a potential emission reduction measure. However, 
since this approach generates breakdown products, including 
HFCs (notably HFC-41), further work still remains to be done 
in characterizing the potential consequential effects of the by-
products before the approach can be classiﬁed as a genuine 
emission reduction option. Nevertheless, the overall global 
warming impact of the emissions would be reduced if such a 
process were to occur in practice. 
 
It remains difﬁcult to evaluate the impact of such a mea-
sure in quantitative terms. It would reduce the impact of blow-
ing agents landﬁlled in the past or in the future. Since reliance 
on landﬁll is falling in many parts of the world, this reduction 
could be limited. While the current emission models used for 
this report allow, for the ﬁrst time, the quantiﬁcation of the 
banks that have already been landﬁlled (but not included in the 
bank estimates quoted in this report), the degree of mitigation 
that can be achieved will be dependent on the prevalence of ap-
propriately designed and managed landﬁll sites. An assessment 
of this potential goes beyond the scope of this report.
 
In summary, the emissions projections are highly sensitive 
to emission function estimates because of the slow release rates 
involved and the size of the remaining banks. This is an impor-
tant caveat when viewing detailed emission assessments. Table 
7.9 illustrates the estimated uncertainties for key blowing-agent 
types. It should be noted that the uncertainties are more pro-
nounced for annual estimates than they are for cumulative emis-

sions over longer periods. This reﬂects particular difﬁculties in 
predicting end-of-life activities (e.g. refrigerator disposal) on an 
annualized basis. It remains much easier to predict cumulative 
disposal over a ten-year period when the year-to-year variations 
offset one another. 
 
The signiﬁcant uncertainties in HFC emissions in 2002 as a 
proportion of bank size arise from the fact that this was a transi-
tion period (particularly in Europe) and the fact that HFC-152a 
emission rates were less certain. HFC uncertainties will contin-
ue to stabilize as the breadth of use develops and blowing-agent 
banks become established. 
 
Focusing further on HFC emissions, it is clear that the vast 
majority will occur in the developed countries in the period to 
2015, reﬂecting the fact that HCFCs will continue to be used 
during the period to 2040 in most developing countries. Figure 
7.5 illustrates this fact. 
 
This is important for the potential control of HFC emissions, 
since both Europe and Japan are already well advanced in end-
of-life management options. The next section deals with these 
options as a sub-set of a review of emission reduction options 
in the foam sector. 
7.5 
Emission reduction options and their effects 
As has already been noted elsewhere in the text, there are four 
areas of the product life cycle where emissions can be reduced. 
These are: 
• selection of alternative technologies using non-GWP or 
lower GWP blowing-agents; 
• production and ﬁrst year (including installation losses);
• use phase; 
• decommissioning and end of life. 
The current ‘best practice’ and further options for improvement 
are discussed in the following text. ‘Best practice’ is not always 
easy to extrapolate from region to region because of signiﬁcant 
differences in product types and processing methods. 
7.5.1 
Production, ﬁrst-year and use-phase options
Current status and best practice
HFC selection, formulation and potential substitution 
The selection of speciﬁc HFCs can have some bearing on the 
ultimate global warming impact of blowing-agent emissions. 
However, in practice, the two competing HFC technologies in 
most polyurethane applications are HFC-245fa (GWP 1020)3 
and HFC-365mfc/HFC-227ea blends (with GWPs of 950–1100 
depending on blend composition). Accordingly, the distinction 
is minimal unless the formulations have signiﬁcantly different 
loadings of HFC. This can be the case for HFC-245fa, which 
does have a higher blowing efﬁciency than HFC-365mfc/HFC-
227ea. However, the difference in boiling points and ﬂamma-
bility may offset this. In practice, therefore, there is little to be 
gained from switching HFCs to minimize impacts in the poly-
urethane sector. 
 
For gaseous HFCs such as HFC-134a (GWP 1410) and 
HFC-152a (GWP 122), there would appear to be much more to 
gain by switching from HFC-134a to HFC-152a. However, this 
is far from being the case for two reasons. Both are related to 
the fact that the rate of diffusion of HFC-152a from foam cells 
is several times faster than that of HFC-134a. The implication 
is that the emission of HFC-152a is faster and less controllable 
than HFC-134a. This has the added implication that, where the 
foam is being used as thermal insulation, there is less blowing 
agent available to maintain that performance. Since long-term 
thermal performance is a critical characteristic of all insulation, 
the early loss of HFC-152a is a major drawback. As a result, 
HFC-134a is preferred in most insulation foam formulations. 
In practice (particularly in the case of extruded polystyrene), 
blends of HFC-134a and HFC-152a are used to obtain the best 
balance of properties.
 
With the possibility of HFC selection having only a super-
ﬁcial effect, and the formulation loadings being minimized in 
all cases because of cost, attention should rightly turn to poten-
tial substitution with non-GWP blowing-agent replacements. 
This subject was already covered in Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2 
and it can be seen that, in most if not all cases, HFC selection 
is currently based on a well-grounded rationale. However, past 
experience shows that circumstances can change substantially 
with time, and technology breakthroughs in the areas of poly-
urethane spray foam, extruded-polystyrene foams or domestic 
appliances could have marked impacts on HFC consumption. 
To reﬂect the fact that further technological development will 
be required and that experience with HFCs has only just started 
to be acquired in most instances, the emission reduction sce-
nario considered in this analysis assumes that substitution can 
only realistically begin to take place after 2010. It is assumed

that up to 50% of the HFC use at that time could be replaced by 
alternative technologies but that this would occur progressively 
between 2010 and 2015, leaving a rump of foam types reliant on 
HFC-based technologies in 2015 which would, at best, freeze 
consumption until 2020, when further technological develop-
ments might be expected. The impact of such a scenario has 
been assessed under the heading of the ‘50% HFC reduction’ 
option in the analysis that follows. 
Production and ﬁrst-year losses 
Process management measures include the improved encapsu-
lation of processing areas, particularly where unreacted chemi-
cal/blowing-agent mixtures are exposed at elevated ambient 
temperatures. The ability to capture the volatile blowing agent 
from the atmosphere will often depend on the amount of venti-
lation being used in the area (for safety and occupational health 
reasons, this is often signiﬁcant) and the size of the processing 
area. The practicality and cost of such measures will vary sig-
niﬁcantly from process to process. For instance, in spray foams, 
there are few practical ways of recapturing blowing agent, al-
though careful design of spray heads can limit over-spray and 
resulting blowing-agent loss.
 
In the extruded-polystyrene sector, process losses have also 
been under scrutiny within the industry and there is some evi-
dence to suggest that losses in North America could already be 
lower than in Europe because of the product mix and process 
design. These differences have been documented earlier in a 
US EPA Notice of Data Availability (US EPA, 2001). The im-
plication is that production losses could be as low as 10% in 
some scenarios. With current ranges being 15–25% for Europe 
and 10–25% for North America, the ﬁgure of 17.5% for North 
America and 20% for the rest of the world could justiﬁably 
be adopted in future as an alternative to the current default of 
25% (Lee and Mutton, 2004). Nevertheless, a technical break-
through is needed to handle the high-volume air ﬂows and the 
very dilute blowing-agent concentrations generated from trim 
reprocessing (Cheminfo Services Inc., 2001) if major savings 
are going to be made in process emissions. 
 
Another example of process management is the minimiza-
tion of process waste. In the case of both phenolic and polyure-
thane block foams, there is an opportunity to recapture blow-
ing agent from off-cuts. These can be signiﬁcant in the case of 
fabricated pipe sections where block utilization rarely exceeds 
55%. Similar waste minimization practices can also be encour-
aged during the installation phase of insulation products in 
buildings.
 
Taking these as examples of potential opportunities, this 
analysis has assumed that block-foam measures could be intro-
duced as soon as 2005 and that efforts to improve processing 
and ﬁrst-year losses could be implemented across other foam 
sectors from 2008. Given the technical and economic chal-
lenges, broader measures of this kind will not be expected to 
achieve a saving better than 20% on average. 
Use-phase assessments 
With respect to use-phase emissions, the main opportunities 
are provided through product design. They include the use of 
less permeable facings on boardstock products. However, care 
needs to be taken to avoid the misapplication of facing types, 
since breathable facings are critical to the satisfactory operation 
of some products.
 
The implementation of Article 16 of Regulation 2037/2000 
in the European Union has increased the ﬂow of information 
about the effectiveness of recovery of blowing agents from 
refrigerators (OJ, 2000). This information had already been 
established in several Member States and built into relevant 
standards (RAL GZ728, 2001; Draft DIN-8975-12, 2002). 
However, these standards were based on minimum recovery 
rates of approximately 70% of initial charge, implying consid-
erably greater loss in the use phase than the assumptions used in 
the emissions models developed by the TEAP and others. This 
potentially higher loss rate has been supported by subsequent 
work by the Centre for Energy Studies in Paris (Zoughaib et al., 
2003). There is a case, therefore, for increasing the annual loss 
assumptions in the use phase from the 0.25% used in the TFCRS 
study (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab) to 0.5% or 0.75%. The difference 
with use-phase losses for commercial refrigeration or other in-
sulated panels could be rationally ascribed to the presence of 
a thermoplastic liner. However, it has been decided to wait for 
further investigation of aged refrigerators before adopting this 
change. 
 
Conversely, as discussed earlier, measurements of effective 
blowing-agent-diffusion coefﬁcients for laboratory and ﬁeld-
aged XPS samples by Vo and Paquet, and work by Lee and 
Mutton on the average thickness and installed use temperature 
of XPS boards, have given a better understanding of loss mech-
anisms and support a reduction of annual use-phase losses to 
0.75% from the original TFCRS study value of 2.5% (UNEP-
TEAP, 2002ab).
 
Since considerable uncertainties about emission rates in use 
exist and bearig in mind that general thicknesses of insulation 
are likely to increase (lower surface to volume ratio), leading to 
reductions in emission rates, it is naturally difﬁcult, and perhaps 
inappropriate, to postulate  a fully deﬁned emission reduction 
scenario in this phase of the lifecycle. The reality is that the 
losses in use (i.e. after the ﬁrst year) are low as a proportion of 
the total blowing-agent loading, and that changes in technology 
are unlikely to have any major impact. 
7.5.2 
Decommissioning and end-of-life options
Some foam sub-sectors (e.g. steel-faced panels, domestic and 
commercial appliances and some types of boardstock) have 
signiﬁcant potential for the recovery of the blowing agent at 
end of life. To quantify this potential, it has been necessary to 
evaluate the condition of foam at the time of decommission-
ing to ensure that enough blowing agent is still available for 
recovery. Considerable work has been gone into the veriﬁcation 
of these levels since the development and publication of the 
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   342

TFCRS Report in 2001/2002 (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab). This has 
included work by the Insulation Technical Advisory Committee 
of AHAM4, the Danish Technical University (Scheutz and 
Kjeldsen, 2001), the Japan Technical Centre for Construction 
Materials (JTCCM) (Mizuno, 2003) and others. The work of 
the JTCCM in particular has involved the sampling of foams 
of varying ages from over 500 buildings and the conclusions 
have broadly endorsed the emission functions included in the 
TFCRS Report (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab). Use-phase emission 
rates for extruded polystyrene are the exception here and these 
have been re-evaluated in the light of the recent work by Vo and 
Paquet (Vo and Paquet, 2004). 
 
Much of the aforementioned work, as well as Fabian et al. 
(2004), has highlighted the need for a robust method of assess-
ing blowing-agent content in foams and this has led to the de-
velopment by JTCCM of a draft Japanese standard on the sub-
ject and a draft ASTM standard. 
 
A second element of importance has been the establishment 
of possible end-of-life treatment methods for foams. The lat-
est models used for this analysis (Ashford et al., 2004ab) have 
incorporated four end-of-life scenarios: 
1. re-use;
2. landﬁll;
3. shredding without recovery of blowing agent; 
4. shredding with recovery of blowing agent.
It has been assumed that direct incineration of the foam results 
in the same loss proﬁle as ‘shredding with recovery of blowing 
agent’ because of the similar front-end handling requirements. 
Both techniques have been used in Europe for refrigerators, al-
though problems with incineration residue have curtailed the 
widespread commercialization of the incineration approach in 
this instance. 
Technical options
The development of end-of-life management techniques for 
foams continues and further reﬁnements to the mechanical re-
capture/recycle plants are emerging. One of the issues requiring 
improved management is the handling of hydrocarbon blown 
foams in refrigerators. At least two incidents have occurred in 
Europe in recent months and it has emerged that there is a need 
for increased awareness and risk management procedures, par-
ticularly in older plants.
 
As noted previously, the potential for the anaerobic degra-
dation of ozone-depleting substances in landﬁll soils has also 
been investigated (Scheutz et al., 2003) but at present it looks 
as though the ‘ﬂuorine-carbon’ bond might be too strong to be 
broken down by this route, even though CFCs and HCFCs have 
been successfully degraded to HFCs. It may be that the micro-
bial organisms responsible need further acclimatization and this 
will be evaluated further over time. 
 
The direct incineration of foam continues to be a focus of 
attention. The MSWI co-combustion study (APME/ISOPA/
EXIBA, 1996) paved the way for the incineration of building 
insulation. However, as noted above, problems have continued 
in Europe with the direct incineration of complete refrigerators. 
In other parts of the world, where foam and metals can be sepa-
rated without controls, the incineration of the removed foam 
would be an option. In the UK, a study has been conducted 
on the partial dismantling of refrigerators prior to transporting 
(Butler, 2002) with the aim of minimizing cost and environ-
mental impact. However, at present, refrigerators continue to be 
sent to mechanical recapture/recycle plants rather than munici-
pal solid-waste incinerators. 
 
There has been little progress in techniques for recover-
ing blowing agent from insulation products used in buildings, 
although the ongoing trend towards the increased use of pre-
fabricated building elements in Europe and elsewhere is assist-
ing in making currently installed foams more accessible at end 
of life. The ongoing JTCCM project is spending its third year 
investigating the technical potential for recovering blowing 
agents from previously installed foams and the results should 
be reported internationally by mid-2005. 
Economic considerations
The JTCCM study also involves the evaluation of the cost-ef-
fectiveness of recovering blowing agents from foams in build-
ings. This will be the subject of the fourth and ﬁnal year of the 
project. Preliminary indications from previous work carried out 
in the ﬁeld (Swedish EPA, 1996) show that recovery from tra-
ditional buildings may be uneconomical. However, the fact that 
steel-faced panels could be processed through recapture/recycle 
mechanical refrigerator plants may have an impact on future 
achievements.
 
All of these approaches have been stimulated under the 
Montreal Protocol framework, which does not mandate recov-
ery. Under the Multilateral Fund, the ﬁnance made available for 
phase-out is typically capped at $15/kg (Jeffs et al., 2004). At 
previous levels of activity, the mechanical recapture/recycling 
processes were handling refrigerators at a net cost of $15–20/
unit (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab), although more recent information 
from the market suggests that this may have even fallen as low 
as $10/unit. With typical recovery levels of 250–325 g per unit, 
the cost of recapture and destruction is $30–60 per kg of blow-
ing agent.
 
The mathematics for HFC recovery will be based more spe-
ciﬁcally on climate change economics and the developing con-
cept of the social cost of carbon (Clarkson and Deyes, 2002). 
These aspects are covered in more detail in Section 3.3.4.1. The 
cost of abatement calculations for HFC recovery are still in 
their infancy, but there is an expectation that if sufﬁcient foam 
can reach such disposal facilities intact, the economics under 
a climate change scenario will be more favourable, even for 
foam from buildings. This would be particularly true if invest-
ments were to take into account the real value to the climate 
of the incremental destruction of ozone-depleting substances,

the GWPs of which are even higher than those of the HFCs 
replacing them. These issues will be addressed further in the 
forthcoming UNEP Task Force on end-of-life management for 
foam. 
Expanded ‘best practice’
The domestic refrigeration sector remains the major focus for 
end-of-life management in the short term. If the European ap-
proach to such management were to be extrapolated for use 
elsewhere in the world, the implications for HCFC emissions 
would be signiﬁcant. This would be potentially achievable in 
developed countries from 2007, but would take longer to es-
tablish in developing countries. Under the end-of-life scenario 
developed under this analysis, it is assumed that all decommis-
sioned refrigerators could be managed worldwide from 2010. 
 
The situation is less clear with respect to the recovery of 
blowing agent from building insulation. However, it is appar-
ent that some building elements (e.g. steel-faced panels) could 
be managed technically and economically. Work is continuing 
in the UK to conﬁrm the economics of panel recovery and a 
report is expected in 2005. The speciﬁc advantage associated 
with panels is that they could be managed using the plants al-
ready established for refrigerators. This means that full recov-
ery could commence as early as 2007. 
 
For other types of building insulation, the situation is less 
clear. Even with favourable technology and economics, the 
development of an appropriate infrastructure would take time. 
The JTCCM project is expected to provide further information 
on this issue when it reports ﬁnally in 2005. For the sake of this 
assessment, however, it is assumed that no more than 20% of 
the remaining blowing agent will be technically and economi-
cally recoverable and, even then, this will not be possible be-
fore 2010. 
7.5.3 
Further analysis of cost elements
There have been few systematic reviews of abatement costs 
for the foam sector. The March Consulting Group (1998) re-
viewed potential emissions and abatement options for HFCs in 
the European Union. However, this review only included the 
costs of the options identiﬁed at that time for the reduction of 
potential extruded-polystyrene emissions. Ecofys picked up the 
agenda in the EU Sectoral Objectives Report (Harnisch and 
Hendriks, 2000) and conducted a more systematic review of 
abatement costs for both the extruded-polystyrene and polyure-
thane sectors. However, there were several drawbacks to this 
study. First of all, it was written before the transition to HFC 
blowing agents had taken place in Europe and before many of 
the technology choices had been ﬁnalized. As a consequence, it 
considerably over-estimated the uptake and consequent emis-
sions of HFCs in the region. Secondly, it was only tasked to 
look at emission-abatement options that would be effective 
by 2010. This immediately ruled out the costing of end-of-life 
management options and forced the focus onto HFC-substitu-
tion technologies. 
 
For the major polyurethane foam technologies, abatement 
costs in the range of $25–85 per tonne of CO2-eq (1999 cost 
base) were estimated where replacement technologies were 
believed to exist (based approximately on a 50% emission re-
duction potential on average). If anything, it is anticipated that 
these costs are now on the low side, since many polyurethane-
foam sectors have minimized the amount of HFCs used per unit 
of foam by the adoption of blends and other similar techniques, 
making abatement investments less effective. 
 
Both March (1998) and Ecofys (Harnisch and Hendriks 
(2000)) gave particularly low estimates of abatement costs for 
measures for extruded polystyrene; both were in the range of 
$6–12 per tonne of CO2-eq on the basis of transitions to CO2 
blowing options with investment amortization over a ﬁfteen-
year period. However, it should be noted that a transition to 
CO2-based technologies is not currently possible for smaller 
producers and other regional markets (e.g. North America). 
The more recent IMAC Report (US EPA, 2004) has reassessed 
this option on a global basis and states an even lower estimate 
for the cost of transition. However, industry sources have been 
quick to point out that all of the emissions models used for these 
costing exercises have: 
• overstated in-life emissions (Vo and Paquet, 2004); 
• under-estimated the magnitude and costs of density 
increases;
• under-estimated the signiﬁcance of thickness constraints;
• used investment cost information that is too low.
Estimates of polyurethane-foam technology abatement costs 
from the IMAC have also been lower than those from earlier 
European studies, but this may be due to the adoption of a 25-
year amortization period for investments, which most commen-
tators consider to be excessive for this industry. 
 
The IMAC Report is the only study so far to provide a sys-
tematic appraisal of the costs of recovering blowing agents 
from appliances at end of life. The estimates, described by the 
authors as ‘illustrative, rather than deﬁnitive’, suggest costs in 
the order of $18–20 per tonne of CO2-eq for automated process-
es and $48 per tonne of CO2-eq for manually dismantled units 
with foam incineration. Anecdotal information from Europe 
suggests that ozone-depleting substances are currently being 
recovered at a price of around $40/kg. If transferred to HFC 
blowing agents, this would equate to an emission abatement 
cost of somewhere below $40 per tonne of CO2-eq, depending 
on the proﬁt margins applied. This would be considerably lower 
again for CFCs where GWPs are higher. 
 
There is no data at present about blowing agents recovered 
from building elements and this is a subject for review in the 
UNEP TEAP Task Force Report scheduled for publication in 
mid-2005.

1. a 50% reduction in HFC consumption between 2010 and 
2015;
2. the implementation of production and ﬁrst-year emission 
reductions in the block-foam sector from 2005 and in other 
sectors from 2008; 
3. the geographic extension of end-of-life management for 
domestic refrigerators, together with a further extension 
to cover steel-faced panels and, where practicable, other 
building foams.
It can be seen that focusing on reducing HFC consumption pro-
vides the most signiﬁcant saving in the period to 2015 and, if 
any such reduction is extrapolated to include use patterns be-
yond 2015, it offers the greatest ‘HFC-speciﬁc’ beneﬁt to 2100 
as well (see Table 7.10). In contrast, end-of-life measures deliv-
er lower savings in the period to 2015, but have the potential to 
deliver more overall savings in the period to 2100 if all blowing 
agent types are considered. The value is particularly signiﬁcant 
for CFCs, where GWPs are signiﬁcant and where there is an 
incremental effect of ozone depletion. 
 
Table 7.10 sets out the cumulative savings as at 2015, 2050 
and 2100 by blowing-agent type, with the aim of providing a 
clearer picture of the analysis conducted. However, it must be 
recalled that these savings (particularly in the end-of-life sce-
narios) could be conservative depending on the assumptions 
adopted for the business-as-usual losses for landﬁll.
 
Of course, in reality, any set of measures is likely to encom-
pass elements from all three scenarios rather than to follow one 
exclusively at the expense of the others. The purpose of this as-
sessment is only to indicate the relative signiﬁcance of various 
options in order to provide a basis for prioritization.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) 
are major illnesses worldwide affecting over 300 million peo-
ple. Inhaled therapy is, and is likely to remain, the gold stan-
dard for treatment. There are two main methods of delivering 
respiratory drugs for most patients: these are the metered dose 
inhaler (MDI) and the dry powder inhaler (DPI). The choice of 
the most suitable inhaler is a complex medical decision taken in 
consultation between the doctor and patient. 
 
When the MDI was introduced in the mid-1950s, CFCs 
were used as propellants and these have been replaced in recent 
years with HFCs, although the complete phase-out of CFCs in 
MDIs is not expected to be before 2010. CFCs and HFCs are 
used in MDIs because of their chemical and physical properties 
and no other propellants have been developed to date that might 
constitute alternatives. Multidose DPIs, which do not require a 
propellant, have also become more widely available in the past 
decade as a not-in-kind replacement and this has mitigated the 
growth of the use of MDIs. 
 
MDIs remain the dominant form of treatment for asthma 
and COPD worldwide in terms of units prescribed. In devel-
oped countries, the proportion of MDI to DPI varies substan-
tially from country to country: from 9:1 MDI:DPI in the USA 
to 7:3 in UK and 2:8 in Sweden. The variation is accounted for 
by a number of factors, including availability (e.g. multidose 
DPIs only recently became available in the USA; by contrast, 
there is a local manufacturer and a long tradition of DPI use in 
Sweden), patient and physician choice, and relative cost. CFC 
MDIs are being phased out, and being replaced by HFC MDIs 
and DPIs. The use of DPIs in developing countries is negligible. 
Both MDIs and DPIs play an important role in the treatment 
of asthma/COPD and no single delivery system is universally 
acceptable for all patients. It is critical to maintain the range of 
therapeutic options.
 
The CFC transition under the Montreal Protocol is still in 
progress, with rates varying between countries. CFC inhalers 
are being replaced by both HFC MDIs and DPIs. The main 
impact on GWP is made by the transition from CFC to HFC 
MDIs. Recently, a number of new drugs have been launched 
in DPIs. DPIs are generally more expensive than MDIs (espe-
cially for salbutamol) and not all drugs are available in DPIs. As 
approximately 50% of CFC MDIs have historically contained 
salbutamol, it is likely that this rescue medication will continue 
to be given in MDIs and will necessitate the continued use of 
HFCs. As the development and regulatory time scales for new 
inhaled delivery systems are lengthy (10 years or longer) no 
major technical breakthroughs are expected to become avail-
able for patients for 10 to 15 years (Table 8a). 
 
Predicting HFC usage in MDIs for developing countries 
is quite difﬁcult and depends on a number of factors, some of 
which are under the control of national governments:
• the timing of CFC phase-out by local MDI manufacturers 
(including HFC intellectual property and manufacturing is-
sues); 
• nationally-produced DPIs will emerge, but it is likely these 
will still cost more per dose than HFC MDIs;
• disease trends and the continued uptake of multidose DPIs;
• general availability of affordable medicines.
Switching patients from reliable and effective medications has 
signiﬁcant implications for patient health and safety. The provi-
sion of a range of safe alternatives is critical before enforcing 
change on environmental grounds. Any environmental policy 
measures for the future that could impact patient use of HFC 
MDIs would require careful consideration and consultation 
with physicians, patients, national health authorities and other 
health-care experts.
 
The overall use of HFCs for MDIs for asthma/COPD 
(rounded off to the nearest 100 tonnes) is predicted to be up to 
15,000 metric tonnes (13,500 tonnes HFC-134a, 1500 tonnes 
HFC-227ea) by 2015. On the basis of these forecasts, the maxi-
mum environmental beneﬁt of the hypothetical extreme case of 
switching all HFC MDIs to DPIs would be in the order of 23 
million tonnes of CO2 per year. 
 
The estimated incremental cost of switching HFC MDIs to 
DPIs would be mainly related to inexpensive salbutamol HFC 
MDIs, and is of the order of an incremental and annually recur-
rent US$ 1.7–3.4 billion. This is equivalent to 150–300 US$/
tCO2-eq.
 
Small amounts of HFC are also used in non-inhalational 
topical aerosols, but most applications have non-HFC alterna-
tives (mechanical pumps, hydrocarbon propellants, etc.).

8.1 
Introduction
Medical aerosols include metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for 
asthma and COPD, and non-MDI medical aerosols.
8.1.1 
 Metered dose inhalers
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
are the most common chronic diseases of the air passages (air-
ways or bronchi) of the lung and are thought to affect over 300 
million people worldwide. These illnesses account for high 
health-care expenditure, cause signiﬁcant absence from work 
and school, and premature death. Modern treatment for these 
conditions involves the inhalation of aerosol medication with a 
speciﬁc particle size (1–5 micron), which is deposited into the 
airways of the lung (bronchi). This allows maximal local effect 
in the airways where it is needed and minimizes the side-effects 
of the drug elsewhere in the body. 
Asthma
Asthma is a chronic condition with two main components: air-
way inﬂammation and narrowing. Most patients have symp-
toms every day, with more severe attacks intermittently, during 
which coughing and wheezing develop and the airways narrow, 
making it very difﬁcult to breathe. Attacks of asthma may occur 
spontaneously or be triggered by many environmental factors 
or viral infections. Attacks of asthma may require urgent ad-
ditional medication, they sometimes require hospitalization and 
they are occasionally fatal. 
 
Asthma most often starts in childhood, and persists into 
adult life, causing frequent attacks, chronic ill health and inca-
pacity. A recent international study of asthma in childhood has 
shown a prevalence of asthma that varies from approximately 1 
percent in some countries such as Indonesia to over 30 percent 
in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia (ISAAC-
SC, 1998). It is more common in afﬂuent countries, but has 
been increasing rapidly in developing countries over the last 
two decades. This increasing prevalence is likely to be due to 
multiple factors including ‘westernization’, changes in house 
design, greater exposure to house dust mite, maternal smoking, 
diet, air pollution and/or tobacco smoking.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
COPD is a condition involving the narrowing and inﬂammation 
of the airways in conjunction with damage to the lung tissue 
(emphysema). COPD is caused primarily by cigarette smoking, 
with inhalation of occupational dusts or environmental air pol-
lution as potential co-factors. COPD is persistent and progres-
sive if the patient continues to smoke, and further deterioration 
can still occur even after smoking cessation. COPD ultimately 
leads to permanent disability and death. Acute exacerbations of 
COPD frequently require hospitalization.
 
The prevalence of COPD in many developed countries is 
around 4–17 percent in the adult population aged over 40 years 
(summarized in Celli et al., 1999). Data are less certain in de-
veloping countries but ﬁgures as high as 26 percent have been 
quoted. Rates in men are generally higher than women and re-
ﬂect smoking prevalence. Smoking is beginning to decline in 
some developed countries, but trends in developing countries 
indicate that both smoking and the prevalence of COPD are of 
increasing concern. 
 
In the 1996 Global Burden of Disease Study sponsored by 
the World Health Organization, COPD was ranked 12 in terms 
of disability, but is projected to rank 5 in 2020, behind isch-
aemic heart disease, major depression, trafﬁc accidents and 
cerebrovascular disease. In 1998, COPD was the fourth most 
common cause of death in the United States after heart disease, 
cancer and stroke. In most developed countries, the male death 
rate from COPD has been declining. By contrast, the female 
mortality rate is increasing and it is expected that mortality 
rates amongst females will overtake those men by about 2005. 
Treatment
Modern treatment of asthma and COPD consists of inhaled 
therapy (Dolovich, 2000). This affords highly effective treat-
ment with few side-effects. 
 
There are two main categories of inhaled treatment for 
asthma and COPD: bronchodilators (also called acute reliev-
ers), and anti-inﬂammatory medication (also called controllers 
or preventers).
Bronchodilators (reliever medication)
Virtually all patients with asthma and COPD require short-act-
ing bronchodilators. Bronchodilators reduce muscle tightening, 
which contributes to the narrowing in the airways. They are 
the key treatment for acute attacks and are lifesaving in severe 
attacks. In intervals between attacks, they may be needed fre-
quently through the day, particularly in children for whom ex-
ercise-induced asthma is common.
Inhaled bronchodilators fall into three classes:
• Beta-agonists – These are the main reliever treatment for 
asthma and COPD. Short acting beta-agonists include sal-
butamol (known as albuterol in the United States), terbuta-
line, and fenoterol. They act within a few minutes, and have 
an effect lasting approximately 4 hours. 
• Long-acting beta-agonists - salmeterol and formoterol have 
an effect that may last for up to 12 hours. 
• Anti-cholinergics including ipratropium bromide and tiotro-
pium bromide. These are commonly used as ﬁrst-line bron-
chodilator therapy in COPD. 
Anti-inﬂammatory medication (controllers or preventers)
Inﬂammation of the airways is a fundamental part of asthma, 
and suppression of this inﬂammation is recommended in all 
but those with mild infrequent symptoms. Anti-inﬂammatory 
treatment stabilizes lung function and prevents acute exacer-
bation of asthma if used regularly, hence the term ‘preventer’.

Preventers are commonly used in COPD, but are less effective 
in this condition. Inhaled preventers are usually one of two 
classes of drug:
• inhaled steroids (e.g. beclomethasone, budesonide, ﬂunisol-
ide, ﬂuticasone or triamcinolone): these are the mainstay of 
preventer medication for asthma and COPD;
• cromoglycate-like drugs (e.g. sodium cromoglycate or ned-
ocromil sodium): these are less effective than inhaled gluco-
corticosteroids.
Oral treatments
Oral treatments have a limited, but sometimes important, role in 
asthma/COPD. Theophyllines are an old inexpensive therapy, 
which is both relatively ineffective and has major side-effects. 
Newer oral leukotriene antagonists are safe but have generally 
been found to be less effective clinically and, in any event, they 
are not a substitute for inhaled steroids in asthma, and are inef-
fective in COPD.
8.1.2 
 Non-MDI medical aerosols
Before the Montreal Protocol phase-out of CFCs in non-Article 
5(1) countries in 1996, CFCs were commonly used in aerosols 
outside the asthma/COPD indication, namely for:
• topical (skin) therapy for local anaesthesia and cooling for 
sports injuries; 
• sub-lingual sprays for angina pectoris;
• nasal sprays for allergic rhinitis and sinusitis;
• vaginal foams for contraception;
• rectal foams for colitis.
All these uses have been replaced mainly by mechanical pump 
sprays, hydrocarbon, di-methyl ether and compressed gas, and 
a few by HFC pressurized aerosols. There are also some early 
technical developments of novel treatments formulated in DPIs 
or aqueous sprays by biotechnology companies (e.g. buccal in-
sulin). At this point it can be concluded that it is unlikely that 
signiﬁcant volumes of HFCs will be used in applications other 
than MDIs for asthma/COPD.
8.2 
Technical performance characteristics
Inhalation aerosols have been the subject of signiﬁcant invest-
ment in research and development for most of the past twenty 
years. The science and technology have taken leaps forward in 
response to both therapeutic (Hickey and Dunbar, 1997) and 
environmental needs (Molina and Rowland, 1974).
 
The requirement to phase out ozone-depleting chloroﬂuo-
rocarbon propellants (in MDIs) has increased the interest in 
alternative systems, most notably dry powder inhalers (DPIs). 
Signiﬁcant progress has been made in all aspects of their prin-
ciples of operation, including formulation, metering and disper-
sion in the past decade.
Pressurized metered dose inhalers
A metered dose inhaler (MDI) is a complex system designed 
to provide a ﬁne mist of medicament for inhalation directly to 
the airways as treatment for respiratory diseases such as asthma 
and COPD. The propellant-driven metered dose inhaler (MDI) 
has been the dominant inhaler for almost half a century. The 
combination of the drug dispersed in a high vapour pressure 
propellant, metered accurately in tens to hundreds of micro-
grammes and administered directly to the lungs was a powerful 
new tool for the treatment of pulmonary diseases (Hickey and 
Evans, 1996). The historical conﬂuence of this new technology 
with potent new therapeutic agents revolutionized the treatment 
of asthma and COPD. 
The main components of MDIs are:
• the active ingredient; 
• excipient(s);
• the propellant (a liqueﬁed gas); 
• a metering valve; 
• a canister; 
• an actuator/mouthpiece. 
 
Traditionally, MDIs have contained CFCs, primarily CFC-12 
and CFC-11, and sometimes CFC- 114. However, because 
of the detrimental effect of CFCs on the Earth’s ozone layer 
(Molina and Rowland, 1974), there was an extensive search in 
the 1990s for propellants that could be used as alternatives and 
had much less of an effect on the ozone layer and potentially on 
the environment in general. The hydroﬂuorocarbons 134a and 
227ea are both now being used in the pharmaceutical industry 
as propellants for MDIs (Pischtiak et al., 2001). These materials 
are pharmacologically inert and have similar properties to the 
CFC propellants they replaced (see Table 8.1). However, they

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
are so different from CFCs that they require a signiﬁcant invest-
ment in formulation strategies for the range of drugs tradition-
ally delivered by MDIs.
 
There are two types of MDI formulations: suspension for-
mulations, in which micro-particulate drug (typically micron-
ized material) is dispersed in a combination of propellants; and 
solution formulations, in which the drug freely dissolves in 
either the propellant or a combination of propellant and an ac-
ceptable co-solvent, typically ethanol (June et al., 1994; Smith, 
1995). Both types of formulation have inherent advantages and 
disadvantages. Traditionally, suspension formulations have 
been the more common dosage form, but with the advent of the 
hydroﬂuoroalkane propellants (HFC-134a; HFC-227ea), which 
have poor solvency characteristics, the use of co-solvents has 
become more common and solution formulations being used 
more (Leach et al., 1998; Brown, 2002). Other potential propel-
lants (e.g. hydrocarbons, pressurized gases) do not possess the 
safety proﬁle of CFCs, or are impossible to reformulate.
 
Globally, there are a number of companies involved in devel-
oping HFC MDIs. They include: 3M Pharmaceuticals (USA); 
Aventis (France/Germany); Boehringer Ingelheim (Germany); 
Chiesi (Italy); Cipla (India); GlaxoSmithKline (UK); and Ivax 
Healthcare (USA/UK) (see Table 8.2). The development of 
HFC MDIs has provided many challenges for the pharmaceuti-
cal industry, requiring new formulations, novel surfactants and 
cosolvents, new valves and canisters, and new manufacturing 
plants. HFC MDIs are manufactured according to ‘good manu-
facturing practices’ regulated and inspected by government 
authorities, and efforts are made to ensure that fugitive HFC 
emissions and waste are strictly controlled (Medicines Control 
Agency, 1997).
 
An HFC MDI, for the widely prescribed short-acting beta-
agonist salbutamol, was introduced in the United Kingdom for 
the ﬁrst time in 1994. Today, there are over 60 countries where 
at least one HFC MDI containing salbutamol has been approved 
and marketed. In addition to the introduction of beta-agonist 
HFC MDIs, there are a growing number of controller medica-
tions (e.g. inhaled corticosteroids) available as HFC MDIs. It 
is estimated that there were approximately 100 million HFC 
MDIs produced globally in 2002 (UNEP-TEAP, 2002), repre-
senting approximately 25% of worldwide MDI production. 
Nebulizers
Nebulizers for the delivery of solutions of drugs were in ex-
istence prior to the development of the MDI. These systems 
found their application in acute ambulatory care and domicili-
ary situations since the droplet size of the aerosol was slightly 
smaller than that of the MDI, could penetrate more deeply into 
the lungs of the patients and did not require a degree of co-
ordination to deliver the drug effectively (Dalby et al., 1996). 
Nebulizers continue to play a valuable role in severely compro-
mised patients and for applications other than asthma, notably 
cystic ﬁbrosis (Garcia-Contreras and Hickey, 2002). 
 
Nebulizers can be used to generate aerosols for inhalation 
from liquid solutions or suspensions. Patient coordination of 
aerosol delivery with inhalation is not as critical as for MDIs or 
DPIs for achieving a therapeutic effect. In addition, aqueous so-
lutions are often easily formulated for use in nebulizers (Niven, 
1996). However, most nebulizers are bulky, inconvenient and 
too expensive for routine use.
 
Nebulizer systems typically fall into the categories of air jet 
or ultrasonic depending on the physical principle used for aero-
sol droplet generation. Jet nebulizers draw solution through a 
capillary tube using the Bernoulli effect and disperse droplets in 
air at high velocity. Ultrasonic nebulizers use high-energy ultra-
sonic vibration to create droplets suitable for inhalation. Until 
very recently, nebulizer use was limited to the hospital or home 
due to the energy requirements and poor portability of conven-
tional systems. In general, the performance of nebulizers tends 
to vary signiﬁcantly depending on the type and formulation.
 
A number of new ‘portable’ nebulizer technologies are be-
ing developed, although these may take some years to become 
commercially available (DeYoung et al., 1998). 
Dry powder delivery systems
DPIs contain dry powder formulations of inhalable drug, but 
do not use propellants. DPIs were used on a limited scale in the 
1960s and 1970s, when the Spinhaler and Rotahaler were used 
Table 8.2.  Currently available formulations (by company) for the most widely prescribed inhaled drugs, salbutamol, beclomethasone,

for the delivery of disodium cromoglycate and albuterol/salbu-
tamol respectively (Dunbar et al., 1998). These were relatively 
inconvenient single-dose capsule-based devices that delivered 
the drug directly into the inspiratory airﬂow of the patient in 
a manner considered passive since additional energy was not 
used to support dispersion. DPIs have continued to evolve. Two 
new devices for once- or twice-daily medications remain as unit 
dose devices, whereas several others are multidose blister or 
reservoir devices (Maggi et al., 1999).
 
The powder formulation is a critical component of a DPI. 
Several key attributes are necessary for successful respiratory 
drug delivery. First, the active drug must be produced in the 
appropriate particle size range of 1–5 microns (Schuster et al., 
1998), whether these ﬁne particles are delivered as pure drug or 
as a formulation with acceptable excipients. Second, the drug 
particles must be chemically and physically stable following 
their manufacture, storage, and subsequent processing when 
preparing the ﬁnal drug product. 
 
Powders of respirable size tend to have poor ﬂow character-
istics due to adhesive interparticle forces. To facilitate powder 
ﬁlling and dispersion, the drug particles can be formulated with 
additional excipients, usually lactose. Regardless of the compo-
sition, regulatory requirements mean that the ﬁnal powder for-
mulation must provide a stable and reproducible aerosol. This 
is mainly assessed by the total emitted dose and ﬁne particle 
fraction (Hickey, 1992; US FDA, 1998). DPIs may be less suit-
able for some patients with low inspiratory ﬂow rates, such as 
the elderly and young children.
 
Most DPI formulations are sensitive to moisture during pro-
cessing and moisture ingress into packaging during storage. The 
presence of moisture in the ultimate product has been shown to 
reduce the de-aggregation of the powder, thereby decreasing 
the ﬁne particle fraction of the aerosol (Boekestein et al., 2002; 
Staniforth, 2002). One approach proposes the use of magne-
sium stearate as a lubricant and anti-caking agent to maintain 
an inhalation powder’s ﬁne particle fraction under extreme tem-
perature and humidity conditions (Staniforth, 2002). 
 
Sensitivity of asthmatics to excipients must be considered 
when developing new products. For example, a metaproterenol 
MDI product reformulated with a new surfactant was withdrawn 
shortly after launch due to escalating reports of coughing, gag-
ging, and asthma exacerbation (Poochikian and Bertha, 2000). 
A powder’s sensitivity to moisture can also be overcome by 
designing and manufacturing packages (multi- or single-dose) 
with a proper moisture barrier. Exploiting advances in packag-
ing technology can improve inhalation powder stability while 
avoiding the risk of new excipients.

Health and safety considerations
Inhaled therapy is the mainstay of treatment for asthma and 
COPD. MDIs are currently the most widely used inhalation 
device and millions of patients around the world rely on these 
products to manage their chronic, lifetime illnesses effectively 
(Wright, 2002). In order to accomplish the phase-out of CFCs 
under the Montreal Protocol, the MDI industry undertook an 
exhaustive search for an appropriate alternative aerosol propel-
lant. An inhalation propellant must be safe for human use and 
meet several additional strict criteria relating to safety and ef-
ﬁcacy: (i) liqueﬁed gas, (ii) low toxicity, (iii) non-ﬂammable, 
(iv) chemically stable, (v) acceptable to patients (in terms of 
taste and smell), (vi) appropriate solvency characteristics, and 
(vii) appropriate density (Tansey, 1997; Smith, 1995). It was 
extremely difﬁcult to identify compounds fulﬁlling all of these 
criteria and in the end only two hydroﬂuorocarbons – HFC-
134a and HFC-227ea – emerged as viable alternatives to CFCs. 
Two international consortia (IPACT-I and IPACT-II) were then 
established to conduct thorough toxicological testing and en-
sure that these propellants were safe for inhalation by humans 
(Tansey, 1997; Emmen, 2000). 
 
Once suitable non-CFC propellants had been identiﬁed, the 
MDI industry undertook to reformulate the CFC MDIs so that 
they could use HFCs. The components and formulations had 
to be substantially modiﬁed to use the new HFC propellants. 
As drug products, MDIs are subject to extensive regulation by 
national health authorities to ensure product safety, product ef-
ﬁcacy and manufacturing quality. The process for developing 
CFC-free MDIs was therefore essentially the same as the de-
velopment of a wholly new drug product, involving full clinical 
trials for each reformulated MDI. Research and development 
for a new product is a lengthy, challenging, and resource-in-
tensive process; typically, it takes about ten years to reach the 
prescribing doctor.
 
After identifying alternate medical propellants and develop-
ing safe, effective CFC-free MDIs, the ﬁnal step in the phase-
out of CFC MDIs is to switch millions of patients to reformu-
lated MDIs and other CFC-free products. Switching patients 
from reliable and effective medications for an environmental, 
rather than therapeutic, reason is a large and unprecedented ex-
ercise with signiﬁcant implications for patient health and safety 
(Wright, 2002; Yellen, 2003; Price, 2004). Patients depend on 
MDIs for the treatment of serious illnesses that frequently im-
pact activities of daily life, and that have potentially life-threat-
ening consequences. For these reasons, asthma and COPD 
patients may be particularly sensitive to a change in a trusted 
treatment regimen. Changes in medicine may also impact pa-
tient compliance with necessary therapy. Comprehensive edu-
cational programmes for patients and physicians are therefore 
important to ensure a smooth transition from CFCs to HFCs. 
 
HFC MDIs play a central role in the timely and effective 
phase-out of CFC MDIs. These products came into existence 
under unique circumstances and solely because of an interna-
tional environmental treaty. Any additional environmental pol-
icy measures taken in the future with a potential effect on pa-
tient use of HFC MDIs will necessarily raise signiﬁcant health 
and safety issues. They will require careful consideration and 
consultation with physicians, patients, national health authori-
ties, health-care experts and the pharmaceutical industry. In 
particular, it is important to bear in mind the realities of medi-
cal decision-making and the central role of physicians and pa-

tients when considering any measures that could impact MDIs. 
Therapeutic decisions, including the choice of delivery system, 
are made by the prescribing physician and are based primarily 
on the individual circumstances of each patient. The optimal 
therapeutic approach varies depending on a variety of factors, 
including a patient’s symptoms, physiology and compliance 
patterns. Each of the existing inhalation delivery systems has 
an important role in the treatment of respiratory illnesses and no 
single delivery system is universally acceptable for all patients. 
DPIs do provide an alternative for patients with asthma/COPD, 
but are not available for some drugs. They do not use propel-
lants, but are complex and usually disposable devices, which 
are generally more expensive than HFC MDIs. It is therefore 
critical to preserve a range of therapeutic options (ICF, 2003; 
UBA, 2004; US-EPA, 2004).
8.4 
Cost issues
Cost of development
The development costs (technical, pharmaceutical and clini-
cal) up to 1999 for the CFC–HFC transition were estimated to 
exceed US$1 billion (Everard, 2001) and signiﬁcant additional 
investment is continuing as reformulation and clinical testing 
has expanded. Similar costs would be expected for the develop-
ment of new DPI products. 
Device/treatment costs
The cost of the HFC propellant is a negligible proportion (~ 
5–10%) of the total cost of an MDI. There is general consen-
sus in the literature that MDIs are less expensive than DPIs for 
asthma and COPD (Consumer Association, 2001; Dalby and 
Suman, 2003; Yellan, 2003). However, quantitative data are 
more limited. The UK is a good model for MDI/DPI usage 
since it is a market with high MDI use and a history of DPI 
usage. Salbutamol is also an important cost model since it is 
the most widely prescribed drug and it is off patent so there 
are a number of generic products competing on price (British 
National Formulary, 2003).
 
The UK Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (Consumer 
Association, 2000) has compared salbutamol on the basis of 
cost per single dose; the result was US$0.030/0.035 for MDIs 
and US$0.078/0.143 for DPIs. For another widely prescribed 
generic drug, beclomethasone dipropionate, treatment costs for 
a year were approximately double for DPIs compared to MDIs. 
In a wider study, which included a comparison of costs across 
seven European countries, the average percentage increase was 
160% for DPIs (Enviros March, 2000). No salbutamol DPI 
products are available at present in the USA. However, generic 
salbutamol CFC MDIs are less expensive than both branded 
CFC and HFC MDIs. Should a salbutamol DPI come to the 
market, it is anticipated that it would be substantially more ex-
pensive than the generic salbutamol CFC MDIs that are cur-
rently available. 
 
In the treatment of asthma and COPD, it is less expensive, 
and at least as effective, to use an MDI with a spacer rather 
than a nebulizer (Barry and O’Callaghan 2003, Stark, 1999, 
Carnago and Kennedy, 2000). In developing countries, the cost 
of therapy is a prime consideration (Gupta, 1998), and DPIs are 
therefore used less (Fink, 2000).
Society costs
Asthma and COPD involve huge costs for society, both at a 
personal level for individual patients and also for society as a 
whole in the form of direct costs (hospitalization, for example), 
and indirect costs (absence from school or work). For example, 
in the USA in 1997, there were nearly 2 million emergency hos-
pital visits (Carnago and Kennedy, 2000) for asthma and, ac-
cording to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, asthma 
cost an estimated US$11 billion in 1998. It should also be borne 
in mind that 26,000 people died of COPD in England and Wales 
in 1999. 
 
Patient choice is important for compliance (Cochrane, 1999; 
Milgrom, 1996) and patients must therefore be satisﬁed with 
their MDI or DPI. Any restriction of patient choice may result 
in reduced compliance with medication, with an increase in the 
already substantial cost for society. Switching patients from re-
liable and effective medications has signiﬁcant implications for 
patient health and safety. The provision of a range of safe al-
ternatives is critical before enforcing change on environmental 
grounds. Any environmental policy measures for the future that 
could impact patient use of HFC MDIs would require careful 
consideration and consultation with physicians, patients, na-
tional health authorities and other health-care experts.
The future
The price of HFCs in the future is expected to vary with normal 
commercial factors and not to rise out of line with economies. 
This is supported by the present example of CFCs, where the 
price is only beginning to rise at the end of the transition period. 
In addition, pharmaceutical-grade HFC is already 2 to 3 times 
more expensive than normal technical-grade HFC due to puriﬁ-
cation costs, and is therefore less dependent on the supply cost 
of technical-grade HFC. 
 
More sophisticated nebulizers (Smart, 2002) or effort-as-
sisted DPIs will probably be even more expensive than the 
DPIs in use at present and there will therefore be an increased 
cost penalty compared to MDIs (Dalby, 2003). However, if they 
provide more effective delivery of the drug, treatment costs 
may be reduced. By contrast, some less complex DPIs currently 
under development (e.g. FlowCaps TM, Hovione; DirectHalerTM 
Pulmonary, DirectHaler) may prove less expensive, and over 
a longer time frame they become more comparable in cost to 
MDIs.
Reimbursment
It should be noted that, although some patients pay directly or 
indirectly via insurance for their medicines, many are reim-
bursed in some way by governments.

Regional considerations
MDIs are the dominant form of treatment for asthma and 
COPD worldwide. In developed countries, the proportion of 
MDI to DPI varies substantially from country to country: from 
9:1 MDI:DPI in the USA to 7:3 in UK and 2:8 in Sweden This 
is linked to a number of factors, including availability (e.g. mul-
tidose DPIs only recently became available in the USA), patient 
and physician choice, and relative cost. CFC MDIs are being 
phased out and replaced by HFC MDIs, and increasingly by 
DPIs. The transition has proceeded slowly as alternatives be-
come available and countries accept the overall increased cost, 
balancing the environmental beneﬁts against the availability 
of affordable medications to patients. A transition to another 
new form of treatment could be both costly and time-consum-
ing, without clinical beneﬁts for patients. Whilst the propor-
tion of HFC MDIs to DPIs is likely to decrease slowly because 
of availability, cost and patient choice, both forms of inhaled 
therapy will continue to be available. 
 
In developing countries, inhaled therapy is mainly with sal-
butamol/albuterol, almost exclusively with pressurized MDIs 
from either multinationals or local manufacturers. CFCs are 
due to be phased out completely by 2010, and this is a major 
challenge for developing countries. The rates of both asthma 
and COPD are rising in these countries, and statistical data 
probably underestimate disease prevalence. Guidelines rec-
ommending the replacement of old and ineffective oral treat-
ments with inhaled therapy are gaining increasing acceptance. 
Improved economic circumstances are likely to result in a sub-
stantial increase in the use of inhaled therapy. One company in 
India is locally producing and marketing a range of HFC MDIs. 
Affordable single dose DPIs are technically feasible and could 
be locally manufactured in developing countries. There would 
be signiﬁcant pharmaceutical difﬁculties in hot and humid cli-
mates (Maggi et. al., 1999), and DPIs would still be more ex-
pensive than MDIs on a cost per dose basis. If these became 
available and achieved a signiﬁcant market share, they would 
reduce the future volumes of HFC needed for MDIs. Multidose 
DPIs from multinational companies are either unavailable or 
too expensive for many patients. MDIs are likely to remain the 
most affordable and acceptable form of inhaled therapy in the 
long term in developing countries. For all the above reasons, 
predictions of HFC needs for inhaled therapy in developing 
countries are uncertain. 
8.6 
Future developments and projections
It is always challenging to project market dynamics in areas 
like pharmaceutical use, where commercial and regulatory 
pressures have such a major impact. It is anticipated that global 
market growth in inhaled medicine in the coming decade will 
be approximately 7% (Enviros March, 2000) whereas growth 
in MDIs is lower at between 1.5 and 3%. Also, provided that 
the MDI transition in developing and industrialized countries 
proceeds according to schedule, it may be assumed that all 
MDIs produced globally will contain HFCs instead of CFCs 
by 2010.
 
Estimates have been made by IPAC (shown in Table 8.3) 
that provide a range for HFC consumption in both 2010 and 
2015, based on various scenarios of market growth and dynam-
ics within the market. Actual growth rates will vary depending 
on the rate of introduction of new therapies for asthma/COPD.
The above projections are based on certain assumptions. These 
include:
• Market growth will be 7% per annum and MDI growth 
within this will range from between 1.5 and 3%. The total 
number of MDI units will be 680 million in 2015.
• Salbutamol MDIs will still represent approximately 50% of 
the overall MDI market. 
• Two HFCs will continue to be used in MDIs for asthma/
COPD. These will be HFC-134a and HFC-227ea, in an ap-
proximate ratio of 90:10. 
The above information makes it clear that the maximum pro-
jected usage of HFCs for MDIs in 2015 will be approximately 
15,000 metric tones. This information allows us to calculate, on 
the basis of hypothetical scenarios, the potential mitigation cost 
for reducing the projected HFC use in MDIS. 
 
There are essentially two approaches to projecting these 
costs. In the ﬁrst case one can take the full amount of projected 
HFC use, assume a certain percentage will be attributable to 
salbutamol HFC MDIs and calculate the likely incremental an-
nual costs to switch them to DPIs on the basis of published 
price differences in certain countries. In this example, we have 
used an average increase of US$5.0 per inhaler. 
 
If we assume that approximately half of the HFC usage will 
be for salbutamol HFC MDIs (i.e. around 7,500 metric tonnes) 
and this equates to 340 million salbutamol inhalers, the eco-
nomic burden to patients or healthcare payers will be around 
US$1.7 billion per annum for a reduction of 11.45 million 
tonnes of CO2. This is equivalent to a mitigation cost of 148.5 
US$/tCO2-eq.
 
Alternatively, using the same set of assumptions, one can 
evaluate the change for a single canister of salbutamol and 
project the cost using a similar approach. In this case, for each 
salbutamol MDI, the amount of propellant in an individual can-
ister is approximately 13.2 grammes of HFC-134a. As 134a has 
a GWP of 1300, the CO2 equivalent of an individual HFC-134a 
MDI is 0.01716 tonnes (13.2 x 1300 / 1,000,000). With an in-
cremental cost for each salbutamol inhaler converted from HFC 
MDI to DPI of US$ 5, this is equivalent to a mitigation cost of 
US$ 5/0.01716 tonnes or approximately 292 US$/tCO2-eq. 
 
In both cases, these estimates do not include any costs as-
sociated with the development of new multidose salbutamol dry 
powder inhalers, but these would be minimal with respect to the 
projected additional cost burden to health-care systems.
 
The calculations provide a range of potential cost impact on 
health-care systems for further HFC MDI mitigation. These es-
timates are of the same order as one available for Europe, based

reports from a number of governments.
 
Conclusions
• Most reduction of GWP from MDIs will be achieved through 
the completion of the transition from CFC to HFC MDIs.
• No major breakthroughs for inhaled drug delivery are an-
ticipated in the next 10–15 years given the current status of 
technologies and the development time scales involved. 
• The health and safety of the patient is of paramount impor-
tance in treatment decisions and policymaking that might 
impact those decisions.
• If one assumes a hypothetical switch for the most widely 
used inhaled medicine (salbutamol) from HFC MDIs to 
DPI, the projected recurring annual costs would be on the 
order of US$ 1.7 billion with an effective mitigation cost of 
between 150–300 US$/tCO2-eq.
• The environmental beneﬁts of converting HFC MDIs to 
DPIs are small.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Halons are gaseous ﬁre- and explosion-suppression agents that 
leave no damaging residue and are safe for human exposure. 
They are inexpensive to make, forgiving to use and applicable 
across a wide range of conditions. Despite these challenging 
benchmarks halons are no longer needed for over 95% of the 
applications that used halons before the Montreal Protocol. This 
transformation came about through a combination of national 
regulations, research, commercial product development and the 
approval of alternatives under ﬁre protection regulations.
The ozone layer
The environmental goal of ozone protection is being achieved 
with a growing base of newly installed systems which now use 
halon alternatives. Seventy-ﬁve percent of the applications that 
originally used halons have shifted to agents with no climate 
impact. Four percent of the original halon applications continue 
to employ halons. The remaining 21% have shifted to HFCs 
and a small number of applications have shifted to PFCs and 
HCFCs. While this is a signiﬁcant achievement, it is tempered 
by the reality that there remains a large base of installed halon 
systems and the eventual choice of alternatives for these sys-
tems remains unknown at this time. 
Past practice (1987–2002)
Before the Montreal Protocol, HFCs, PFCs and HCFCs were 
not used in ﬁre protection. Their current, and growing, usage 
is a direct result of their adoption as halon alternatives, despite 
being inferior to halons both in terms of cost and performance. 
Because ﬁre protection is regulated in most countries, only those 
agents meeting minimum acceptable ﬁre extinguishment and 
life-safety performance levels have been certiﬁed. About half 
of former halon users are now choosing to protect new installa-
tions with zero-ODP gaseous (in-kind) clean agents. Some have 
no signiﬁcant effect on the climate system, while others have 
substantial GWPs. The other half are choosing non-gaseous 
(not-in-kind) agents, such as water, water mist, dry chemical, 
foam and aerosols, all of which produce no direct greenhouse-
gas emissions. There are a small number of users that have ad-
opted HCFC-123, HCFC-22 and HCFC-124 agent blends. 
 
Emissions of gaseous halon alternatives are very small 
compared with those estimated for halon. This is the result of 
cooperation between industry and governments to implement 
standards for system maintenance, training and certiﬁcation 
programmes, and equipment that minimizes or eliminates es-
cape during transfer and detects leaks from storage. Emissions 
are estimated to range from 1 to 3% of the ﬁxed-system bank 
and 2 to 6% of the portable extinguisher bank per year.
 
With the exception of civil aviation applications, where the 
added weight of halon alternatives produces indirect emissions 
through additional fuel use over the aircraft’s life, the indirect 
greenhouse-gas emissions are negligible compared with the di-
rect effects. Total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) and life 
cycle climate performance (LCCP) are therefore not particu-
larly relevant to ﬁre protection.
 
Recent modelling suggests the global ﬁxed-system bank for 
HFCs, PFCs and HCFCs at the end of 2002 was 22,000 tonnes, 
with 1.1 MtCO2-eq of emissions at a 2% emission rate. For por-
table extinguishers, the global bank of HFCs, PFCs and HCFCs 
was approximately 1,500 tonnes at the end of 2002, with 0.12 
MtCO2-eq of emissions at a 4% emission rate.
 
The most recent estimate from the Halons Technical 
Options Committee (HTOC) of the size of the existing halon 
bank and annual emission rates (2002) is 42,000 tonnes with 
2,100 tonnes of emissions for halon 1301, and 125,000 tonnes 
with 17,000 tonnes of emissions for halon 1211 (HTOC, 2003). 
Atmospheric measurements in 2002 for halon 1301 suggest 
emissions of 1000–2000 tonnes and emissions of 7,000–8,000 
tonnes for halon 1211. Halon 2402 was used mainly in the for-
mer Soviet Union and no information on banks or emissions 
was found in the literature. 
Present practice (2003–2004)
In ﬁxed systems where a clean agent is necessary, the alter-
natives currently available are carbon dioxide (lethal at con-
centrations that extinguish ﬁres) and inert gases, HFCs, PFCs, 
HCFCs and more recently, a ﬂuoroketone1 (FK). Carbon-diox-
ide and inert-gas systems account for approximately half of the 
new clean-agent systems, with HFCs, PFCs, HCFCs and FK 
accounting for the other half. HFCs are playing an important 
role in the transition away from halon where the unique proper-
ties of this type of agent are required to achieve safe, fast ﬁre 
extinguishing without causing residual damage. PFCs played 
an early role but current use is limited to the replenishment of 
previously installed systems. The current ﬁxed system bank of 
HFCs, PFCs, HCFCs and FK was estimated to be 27,000 tonnes 
at the end of 2004 with 1.4 MtCO2-eq of emissions at a 2% 
emission rate.
 
Compared to halon 1211, portable extinguishers using 
HFCs, PFCs and HCFCs have achieved very limited market 
acceptance, primarily because of their high cost. PFCs are lim-
ited to use as a propellant in one manufacturer’s portable ex-
tinguisher agent blend. The portable extinguisher bank based 
on information from a producer is approximately 1,850 tonnes, 
with 0.16 MtCO2-eq of emissions at a 4% emission rate at the 
end of 2004.
 
In the case of ﬁxed clean-agent systems, four main factors 
contribute to the choice of replacement agents: performance, 
life safety, cost and environmental concerns. In addition, two 
other factors may be important in some instances: demonstrated 
special capabilities and multiple supply sources. For portable 
extinguishers, cost is the main factor. Table 9.1 compares the 
performance of the available alternatives for gaseous ﬁre extin-
guishing systems and Table 9.2 does the same for portable ﬁre 
extinguishers.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
The future (2005–2015)
During this period, the use of HFCs and FK for ﬁre protection 
is expected to increase due to general economic expansion and 
improvements in technologies that allow these materials to dis-
place current halon applications. The halon alternatives most 
likely to be employed through 2015 are identiﬁed in Tables 9-1 
and 9-2. 
HTOC (2003) estimates that signiﬁcant quantities of halon will 
remain in the global bank in 2015. The ﬁgures for halon 1301 
are as follows: in 2005, there will be a bank of 39,000 tonnes 
with 1,900 tonnes of emissions; in 2010, there will be a bank 
of 31,000 tonnes with 1,500 tonnes of emissions and, in 2015, 
there will be a bank of 24,000 tonnes with 1,300 tonnes of emis-
sions. The ﬁgures for halon 1211 are: a bank of 83,000 tonnes 
with 16,000 tonnes of emissions in 2005, a bank of 33,000 
tonnes with 6,000 tonnes of emissions in 2010 and a bank of 
19,000 tonnes with 1,600 tonnes of emissions in 2015.
 
Modelling suggests an HFC/HCFC/PFC/FK ﬁxed-system 
bank of 67,000 tonnes with annual emissions of 4 MtCO2-eq in 
2015 at an emission rate of 2%. In the absence of a change in 
emission rate, total annual emissions will change in proportion 
to changes in the installed base. For the portable extinguisher 
bank, projections of information provided by a producer are 
4,000 tonnes in 2015 with 0.34 MtCO2-eq of emissions at a 4% 
emission rate.
 
Clean-agent demand will be inﬂuenced by economic growth 
and decisions by regulators and halon owners regarding the dis-
position of agent from decommissioned systems. If decommis-
sioned halon is destroyed, the demand for new clean agents will 
increase, probably in the same proportion as for new systems. 
In addition, clean-agent demand will be inﬂuenced by exist-
ing and future regulation. As research into new ﬁre protection 
technologies continues, additional options will likely emerge. 
However, due to the lengthy process of testing, approval and 
market acceptance of new ﬁre protection equipment types and 
agents, no additional options are likely to be available in time 
to have appreciable impact by 2015. 
 
Since the Montreal Protocol, the ﬁre protection commu-
nity has become much more active in managing emissions. 
Industry practices of capturing, recycling and reusing halons 
have carried over to all high-value gaseous agents, including 
HFCs, HCFCs and PFCs. There is no reason to believe they 
will not also apply to any additional agents entering the market. 
Because of their more complex chemistries, halon replacements 
are unlikely to ever be as inexpensive as halons. As a result, 
there is both a market incentive as well as an industry culture 
that encourage the capture, recycling and reuse of ﬁre-ﬁghting 
agents. Adhering to these practices, including certiﬁcation pro-
grammes, has been shown to minimize emissions and to limit 
the use of these agents to applications where their cleanliness is 
needed. In countries where high levels of regulation exist, the 
emission rates have been estimated at 1% or less; the ﬁgure is 
2% where levels of regulation are average and approaches 3% 
where there is less regulation. Portable extinguishers have an 
emission rate of approximately 4%.

f  For the halocarbon agents, the end-of-life agent value is positive and represents a cost recovery equivalent to 50% of the initial cost of the agent as the agent is 
recovered, recycled and resold for use in either new systems or for the replenishment of existing systems.
g HFC abatement costs for FK-5-1-12 and inert gas are based on HFC-227ea, the predominant HFC, as the reference. The lower value reﬂects the cost in US$ 
per tonne of CO2-equivalent at a discount rate of 4% and tax rate of 0%. The range includes both the lowest and highest of costs for the USA, non-USA Annex 
1 and non-Annex 1 countries.
Explanation of special capabilities:
1. In some jurisdictions HFC-125 is not allowed for use in occupied spaces while in other jurisdictions that use is permitted under certain conditions.
2. Due to the short atmospheric lifetime, no GWP can be given. It is expected to be negligible for all practical purposes (Taniguchi et al., 2003). See Section 
2.5.3.3 ‘Very short-lived hydrocarbons’ for additional information.
3. HFC-23 is effective at low temperatures (cold climates) and in large volumes due to its high vapour pressure.
4. HFC-227ea is effective in shipboard and vehicle applications due to extensive large-scale testing that has established the use parameters and demonstrated its 
specialized capabilities in these applications.
5. HFC-125 is effective in vehicle and aircraft engine applications as a result of extensive large-scale testing that has established the use parameters and demon-
strated its specialized capabilities in these applications.
6. FK-5-1-12 is in the early stages of its product life cycle and has yet to be tested for special applications beyond those achieved through the conventional ap-
proval testing of the requirements in ISO and NFPA type standards.
7. While the agent FK-5-1-12 is a proprietary product of a single agent-manufacturer, the agent is available from multiple systems manufacturers.

Introduction
Halons are halogenated hydrocarbons that contain bromine 
and exhibit exceptional ﬁre-ﬁghting effectiveness. They are 
known as “clean agents” because they are volatile liquids or 
gases, electrically non-conductive and leave no residue. As 
gases, when dispensed in air, they can extinguish hidden ﬁres 
and those with complex geometries (three-dimensional ﬁres). 
At least one halon (1301) is safe for human exposure at concen-
trations that will extinguish ﬁres. In short, they are easy to use, 
versatile and inexpensive. 
 
After their introduction in the early 1960s, the use of halons 
grew steadily worldwide until the Montreal Protocol required 
an end to their production by 1/1/94 in developed countries. 
Global production of halon 1211 and 1301 peaked in 1988 at 
43,000 and 13,000 tonnes  respectively (HTOC, 1991). In de-
veloping countries halon 1211 production began in the 1980s, 
and showed a growth curve similar to developed countries un-
til Multilateral Fund projects began to reverse that trend in the 
1990s (HTOC, 2003). A third halon, 2402, was mainly used in 
the former Soviet Union. No information on emissions or bank 
size was found in the literature. 
 
The most recent estimate of the Halons Technical Options 
Committee (HTOC) of the existing halon bank (their 2002 as-
sessment report (HTOC, 2003)) is as follows. For halon 1301: a 
bank of 39,000 tonnes with 1,900 tonnes of emissions in 2005, 
a bank of 31,000 tonnes with 1,500 tonnes of emissions in 2010 
and a bank of 24,000 tonnes with 1,300 tonnes of emissions 
in 2015. For halon 1211: a bank of 83,000 tonnes with 16,000 
tonnes of emissions in 2005, a bank of 33,000 tonnes with 6,000 
tonnes of emissions in 2010 and a bank of 19,000 tonnes with 
1,600 tonnes of emissions in 2015.
 
Atmospheric measurements in 2002 place emissions of ha-
lon 1301 between 1,000 and 2,000 tonnes. This is close to the 
HTOC estimates. Atmospheric measurements for halon 1211, 
however, are between 7,000 and 8,000 tonnes in 2002, consid-
erably lower than estimated by the HTOC. It appears that re-
cent actions by several parties may result in signiﬁcant future 
adjustments to the estimated quantities and to the geographical 
distribution of halons. However, the HTOC estimate of future 
emissions is currently the best available in the literature. 
 
Halons’ unique combination of properties led to their selec-
tion for many ﬁre protection situations: computer, communi-
cations and electronic equipment facilities; museums; engine 
spaces on ships and aircraft; ground protection of aircraft; ﬂam-
mable liquid storage and processing facilities, general ofﬁce ﬁre 
protection and industrial applications (HTOC, 1989). Wickham 
(2002), however, ﬁnds that the halocarbon alternatives are not 
in such general use now. In part, their high cost appears to be 
limiting their use to applications where a clean agent is a neces-
sity. The development and use of halon alternatives are driven 
entirely by the Montreal Protocol. None of the available alter-
natives offer performance or cost advantages over halons. 
9.1.1 
Overview of the halon market before the Montreal 
Protocol 
The market for halons and their alternatives is divided into two 
distinctly separate sub-sectors: portable extinguishers and ﬁxed 
systems. Halon 1301 (ODP = 10, Montreal Protocol value) 
dominated the market for ﬁxed gaseous systems while halon 
1211 (ODP = 3) dominated the market for gaseous portable ex-
tinguishers. Halon 2402 (ODP = 6) is more toxic than the other 
halons and was used only in a small number of countries. 
9.1.2 
Progress since the Montreal Protocol 
Research on alternatives to halons has been underway since at 
least 1988 (HTOC, 1989). In 1994, the HTOC (1994) reported 
that newly developed replacement products were commercially 
available for most new applications, but stated that retroﬁtting 
of existing systems to use new alternatives needed further eval-
uation.
As of 1999, it was estimated that only 4% of the former halon 
market still required halon in new systems. Applications with 
halon had successfully shifted to new systems with many dif-
ferent alternative agents and approaches, as shown below 
(IPCC/TEAP, 1999):
• not-in-kind (non-gaseous) agents 
50%
• clean agents  
 
 
50%
 
- carbon dioxide and inert gases  
25%
 
- halons 
 
 
 
  4%
 
- PFCs 
 
 
 
<1%
 
- HFCs 
 
 
 
20%
In 2002, the HTOC (2003) concluded that halon was no longer 
necessary in virtually any new installations, with the possible 
exceptions of engine nacelles, passenger spaces and cargo com-
partments of commercial aircraft, and crew compartments of 
military combat vehicles. A new ﬂuorinated agent, ﬂuoroketone 
FK-5-1-12, was also introduced in 2002.
  
For all practical purposes, PFC use has ceased and been re-
placed by HFCs. PFC use is currently limited to the replenish-
ment of existing systems and as a minor component in a stream-
ing agent identiﬁed as HCFC Blend B. 
9.1.3 
Emission characteristics of ﬁre protection 
applications
Any ﬁre protection system or extinguisher must be available for 
discharge at the moment a ﬁre event occurs. Fixed systems and 
extinguishers should therefore be designed, produced and main-
tained in a manner that eliminates loss of agent through leakage 
and, in the case of ﬁxed systems, inadvertent or unwanted dis-
charges. As a result, ﬁre protection codes and standards estab-
lish minimum levels of design, require periodic maintenance, 
and require regulatory authorities to adhere to these minimum 
levels (NFPA, 2000, 2004).

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
 
Since the Montreal Protocol, the ﬁre protection community 
has become much more active in managing emissions. For ex-
ample, the highly emissive equipment testing and personnel 
training practices were eliminated (HTOC, 1991, 1994) and as 
a result emissions have decreased signiﬁcantly. Until 2003, the 
only estimates of emission rates for halons and their alterna-
tives were based on expert opinion. The 1996 IPCC Revised 
Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories recom-
mended using the estimates for halons developed by McCulloch 
(1992) to estimate HFC and PFC emissions (IPCC, 1997). In 
Volume 3, however, it is also noted that the emissions of HFCs 
and PFCs could be reduced by more than 50% in recognition 
of the changes being implemented by the ﬁre protection com-
munity. The HTOC (1997) also estimated that these new pro-
cedures reduced the non-ﬁre emissions of halons by up to 90%. 
Ball (1999) reported that many of the procedures originally 
developed for halons are now being applied to alternatives, re-
ducing emissions far below pre-Montreal Protocol levels. Ball 
opined that emissions for HFCs and PFCs could be as low as 
1% of in-use quantities. On the basis of consultation with in-
dustry, a study prepared for the United Kingdom Department of 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK DEFRA) estimated 
current annual HFC emissions at approximately 5% of the in-
stalled base per annum (AEAT, 2003). 
 
Recent data from the Halon Recycling and Banking Support 
Committee in Japan indicate a 0.12% emission rate for halon 
1301 systems, with the exception of ships, aircraft and mili-
tary systems (Verdonik and Robin, 2004). Verdonik and Robin 
(2004) evaluated the publicly available data relating to the pro-
duction and emissions of HFCs and PFCs from ﬁre suppression 
applications and developed three independent approaches to 
determine emission rates. The study derived an average emis-
sion rate of 2% of the installed base, with an uncertainty range 
of 1 to 3% (i.e. 2% ±1%). 
9.1.4 
Estimates of direct greenhouse-gas emissions
The actual global production or consumption of halon alterna-
tives in ﬁre protection applications is not known. This is be-
cause each is produced by a limited number of companies and 
each company regards their sales-related data as proprietary. 
Actual emissions are therefore reported as an aggregated value 
using the GWPs in the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) 
(IPCC, 1996). All bank and emission estimates presented in 
this report are based on the SAR 100-yr GWP values. It is an-
ticipated that the new 100-yr GWPs for ﬁre protection agents 
provided in this report would change these estimates by less 
than 10%, which is well within the range of results presented 
and signiﬁcantly less than the uncertainty of these estimates. As 
such, no adjustments to the SAR 100-yr GWP values have been 
included in the estimates in this chapter.
 
The UK ﬁre industry collected and reported aggregate emis-
sions of HFCs and PFCs from ﬁre protection applications for 
the years 1997–1999 as part of their voluntary agreement with 
the government (FIC, 1997–1999). The results were: 1997 – 
0.010 MtCO2-eq; 1998 – 0.012 MtCO2-eq; and 1999 – 0.014 
MtCO2-eq. The US ﬁre protection industry collected and re-
ported aggregate emissions of HFCs and PFCs for 2002 under 
their voluntary agreement with the government (Cortina, 2004). 
The result was 0.56 MtCO2-eq. These methodologies estimate 
emissions on the basis of the amount of agent sold to recharge 
systems. The data may therefore slightly understate emissions 
where a system that has been discharged has, for any reason, 
not been recharged.
 
Verdonik (2004) used these UK and US emissions data 
and other publicly available data to update the Fire Protection 
Emissions Model developed under the Greenhouse Gases 
Emission Estimating Consortium. Estimates of emissions of 
HFCs and PFCs from ﬁre protection applications and the ﬁxed-
system bank of HFCs and PFCs were developed using the 1 
to 3% emission rate range developed by Verdonik and Robin 
(2004). The results are provided in Table 9.3 where the compos-
ite gas is deﬁned as consisting of 97.5% HFC-227ea and 2.5% 
HFC-23. As ﬁxed PFC systems are no longer installed, only a 
small difference results when PFC is included in the calcula-
tion. Information provided by a producer of HCFCs for ﬁxed 
systems places the bank in 2002 at 3,400 and in 2004–2015 
at 3,600 tonnes with annual emissions of 0.09 MtCO2-eq. The 
ﬁxed-system bank of HCFCs is assumed to be 85% HCFC-22, 
10% HCFC-124 and 5% HCFC-123.
 
Additional modelling using the methodology of Verdonik 
(2004) suggests the global ﬁxed system bank for HFCs, PFCs 
and HCFCs at the end of 2002 was 22,000 tonnes with 1.1 
MtCO2-eq of emissions at a 2% emission rate assuming (1) that 
the ﬁxed system bank of HFCs/PFCs is approximated in 2002 
by 95.1% HFC-227ea and 2.45% each of HFC-23 and PFC-3-
1-10, and (2) that the ﬁxed-system bank of HCFCs is comprised 
of 85% HCFC-22, 10% HCFC-124 and 5% HCFC-123 (hence-
forth all referred to as the ﬁxed-system composite bank). PFCs 
played an early role but current use is limited to the replenish-
ment of previously installed systems. The annual addition to 
the ﬁxed-system composite bank consists of 97.5% HFC-227ea 
and 2.5% HFC-23. The current ﬁxed-system composite bank is 
estimated at 27,000 tonnes at the end of 2004 with 1.4 MtCO2-
eq of emissions at a 2% emission rate.
 
Looking to the future, modelling suggests a ﬁxed-system 
bank (including 3,600 tonnes of HCFCs and some use of FK) 
of 67,000 tonnes with annual emissions of 4 MtCO2-eq in 2015 
at an emission rate of 2%. In the absence of a change in emis-
sion rate, total annual emissions will change in proportion to 
changes in the installed base. 
 
In countries where high levels of regulation exist, the emis-
sion rates have been approximated as 1% or less. The estimated 
emission rate is 2% where there are average levels of regulation, 
approaching 3% at lower levels of regulation. On the basis of 
the 2000 estimate from HTOC (2003a), portable extinguishers 
are thought to have an emission rate of approximately twice that 
of ﬁxed systems. Applying that factor provides an uncertainty 
range of 2 to 6% (i.e. 4% ±2%). Looking forward, one might 
expect that the continuation of efforts to minimize emissions

Chapter 9: Fire Protection
369
further would drive the emission rates toward the 1% level for 
ﬁxed systems and 2% for portable extinguishers; conversely, a 
relaxation of this goal would likely increase those emissions to 
the 3% level for ﬁxed systems and 6% for portable extinguish-
ers.
 
Products have been available for portable extinguisher ap-
plications since the early 1990s. No information was found in 
the literature about the quantities of HCFCs, PFCs or HFCs used 
for portable extinguisher applications. Information provided by 
a producer, combined with modelling, results in an estimate for 
the portable extinguisher composite bank of HCFCs, HFCs, and 
PFCs of approximately 1,500 tonnes at the end of 2002 with 0. 
12 MtCO2-eq of emissions and approximately 1,900 tonnes at 
the end of 2004 with emissions of 0.16 MtCO2-eq at a 4% emis-
sion rate. The portable extinguisher composite bank is assumed 
to be comprised of 68% HCFC-123, 30% HFC-236fa and 2% 
PFC-14. Assuming an annual 3% growth rate, the estimated 
size of the portable extinguisher composite bank in 2015 will 
be 4,000 tonnes with 0.34 MtCO2-eq of emissions at a 4% emis-
sion rate. 
9.1.5 
Regulatory and approval processes – hurdles to 
introducing new technologies
Most countries regulate the requirements for ﬁre protection and 
the type provided. These controls can take the form of requiring 
ﬁre protection in speciﬁc situations, such as sprinklers in hotels 
and ofﬁces. They can also take the form of required approval for 
the design and installation of speciﬁc ﬁre protection systems. 
For example, organizations such as the National Fire Protection 
Association (NFPA), the Comité Européen de Normalisation 
(CEN) and the International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO) publish standards for speciﬁc types of ﬁre protection 
systems, such as ﬁxed systems using gaseous agents (NFPA, 
2000; ISO, 2000). Some countries simply adopt NFPA or ISO 
standards, while others have their own standard-making bodies. 
For example, the Brazilian Association for Technical Standards 
(ABNT) includes a committee for Fire Protection (CB24) 
(UNEP-TEAP, 1999) and there are some 12 Indian standards 
for halon alternatives. Furthermore, testing organizations such 
as Underwriters Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual Research 
Corporation (FM) test speciﬁc manufacturers’ products to vali-
date their performance against the standards written by the stan-
dard-setting organizations. 
 
Such regulatory and approval processes can limit the intro-
duction of new agents and techniques to those that have dem-
onstrated acceptable levels of performance in two, and some-
times three, key areas: ﬁre extinguishing effectiveness, safety 
for personnel/life safety and possible environmental consider-
ations. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 
has prepared two documents that compile examples of such 
environmental regulations (UNEP 2000, 2001). The reader is 
encouraged to review these documents for further information. 
Only alternative ﬁre protection agents and techniques that have 
satisﬁed or are undergoing nationally or internationally recog-
nized regulatory approval processes are discussed in this sec-
tion.

Reducing emissions through the choice of agents 
in ﬁxed systems
9.2.1 
Agents and systems with the potential to replace 
halons 
With the halt in production of halon total ﬂooding agents, ﬁre 
protection professionals had two choices: (1) to begin using 
not-in-kind alternatives, accepting their deﬁciencies or (2) to 
wait for the development of new alternatives and techniques 
as they come available. Different market sectors were able to 
accept different choices based on the particular ﬁre threat and 
risk acceptance.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
9.2.1.1 
Agents existing at the time of the Montreal Protocol
In its 1989 report, HTOC discussed a technique called the se-
lection matrix. Basically, it places a value on performance pa-
rameters for several ﬁre extinguishing system types, helping end 
users and authorities select the most appropriate alternative for 
a given application. The parameters in the matrix are: (1) low 
space and weight (of the agent storage containers), (2) damage 
limiting (speed of extinguishment and no agent residue), (3) abil-
ity to permeate (works around obstructions), (4) occupant risk 
(safe at concentrations used), (5) ﬂammable liquid extinguishing 
capability, (6) system efﬁcacy, (7) energized electrical equipment 
capability (electrically non-conductive) and (8) installed cost.
 
None of the new halon alternatives (HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, 
FK, inert gases, water mist, etc.) had been developed at the time 
of the 1989 report. The types of systems directly considered in 
the matrix at that time were: automatic water sprinklers, fast 
response water sprinklers, pre-action water sprinklers, total 
ﬂooding dry-chemical systems, total ﬂooding carbon-dioxide 
systems, deluge water-spray systems, low-expansion foam and 
high-expansion foam.
 
The HTOC matrix effectively illustrates the individual 
strengths and weaknesses of the various systems, and reveals 
that all of the alternatives available at that time had one or more 
shortcomings that would prevent them from fully replacing ha-
lon in every application. 
9.2.1.2 
Agents developed since the Montreal Protocol
The conclusion drawn from the HTOC 1989 matrix – that no 
single suitable alternative for halon 1301 existed at that time 
– served as the incentive for the development of ﬁre extinguish-
ing systems using agents in four broad categories:
• halocarbon gaseous chemical agents including HCFCs, 
PFCs, HFCs and FK;
• inert gases, such as nitrogen or argon, or blends of those 
inert gases;
• water mist;
• ﬁne powder aerosol.
Alternatives to halon fall into two broad categories: (1) clean 
agents similar to halon 1301 and (2) additional not-in-kind 
agents and systems similar to the other pre-Montreal Protocol 
alternatives. 
9.2.2 
Not-in-kind technologies
Not-in-kind technologies include the agents and systems con-
sidered in the 1989 HTOC matrix and the more recently devel-
oped water-mist and ﬁne-powder-aerosol systems. When com-
pared to halon, all of the not-in-kind alternatives continue to 
have the same ﬁre protection shortcomings described in 1989. 
However, each has an appropriate place within ﬁre protection. 
Not-in-kind alternatives offer the advantage of generating no 
direct greenhouse-gas emissions and are currently being used 
in about half of the applications that used halon before the 
Montreal Protocol (IPCC/TEAP, 1999). 
9.2.2.1 
Water-based systems
Water-based systems include automatic, fast response and pre-
action water sprinklers, deluge water spray and water mist. In 
some applications, additives protect against freezing. Water-
based systems have a limited ability to permeate obstructions, 
poor ﬂammable liquid extinguishing capability and use 
limitations around energized electrical equipment (HTOC, 
1989). Water itself may damage the items to be protected, i.e. 
it is not a clean agent. By contrast with gaseous agents, there is 
also an agent residue after the systems discharge. Water mist 
technology has achieved limited market acceptance, primarily 
in turbine and diesel-powered machinery and, somewhat less 
frequently, machinery spaces aboard ships. Water mist faces 
two obstacles (Wickham, 2002). First, the systems are not good 
at extinguishing small ﬁres in large volumes, even to the point 
of failing to extinguish them. Second, applications are limited 
(in size and characteristics) to those where ﬁre test protocols 
have been developed in which system performance has been 
determined empirically. This drives up costs higher than for 
other technologies.
9.2.2.2 
Total ﬂooding dry-chemical and aerosol systems
These systems use compounds such as sodium bicarbonate, am-
monium phosphate and potassium bromide. They have a lim-
ited ability to permeate obstructions and leave a residue that 
normally precludes use for the protection of electronic equip-
ment spaces. With aerosol systems, the technology is so new 
that suitable standards for approval testing and application re-
quirements are still under development by the major standards 
organizations, including the NFPA, CEN and ISO. 
9.2.2.3 
Foam systems
Systems using foam employ water-based formulations con-
taining surfactants to produce semi-stable foams. These sys-
tems leave agent residue after discharge and are larger and 
heavier than other options. They have limited ability to perme-
ate obstructions and are not used around energized electrical 
equipment. Foams also have other environmental impacts on 
water quality and aquatic life (Ruppert and Verdonik, 2001). 
One manufacturer’s version of Aqueous Film Forming Foam 
(AFFF), the best performing foam, is no longer produced in the 
US due to persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity concerns 
(Dominiak, 2000).
 
Continuing research and development is underway with 
water mist and aerosol systems, as are efforts to develop and 
improve test methods and application standards (IMO, 1996, 
1999, 2001).
9.2.3 
Clean agents
Clean agents include inert gases (nitrogen, argon or blends of 
these two sometimes incorporating carbon dioxide as a third 
component), HCFC blends, HFCs, PFCs, FK and in some deﬁ-
nitions carbon dioxide also (NFPA, 2000). With the exception 
of carbon dioxide, all clean-agent alternatives have been de-
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   370

371
veloped since the Montreal Protocol and are used when not-
in-kind technologies do not offer the required level of per-
formance. While carbon dioxide systems have been used for 
many years and the technology is well developed, its use as a 
total ﬂooding agent in occupied spaces involves signiﬁcant life 
safety considerations. This is because the concentration needed 
to extinguish a ﬁre is lethal. Numerous incidents of fatalities 
have been reported (Wickham, 2003). Carbon dioxide systems 
are therefore not included in the detailed sections below. They 
may be appropriate for use in some applications but only where 
personnel cannot be exposed.
 
PFC systems were initially used to help in the transition 
away from halons, but because of their impact to the climate 
system and lack of performance advantage over other alterna-
tives new systems are no longer installed. The original agent 
manufacturer is supporting existing systems where necessary.
9.2.3.1 
Progress with clean-agent systems 
Market acceptance of the halocarbon and inert gas systems was 
generated relatively quickly. This was made possible by the 
early development of standards and the willingness of end us-
ers to accept these agents (NFPA, 2000; ISO, 2000; and IMO, 
1998a,b). However, the path to market for new ﬁre extinguish-
ing agents and systems is laborious (Wickham, 2002). In most 
instances, the suitability of an agent is determined through data 
submittals, reviews and often testing involving the following: 
national health authorities to approve safe usage levels, national 
environmental authorities to assure compliance with laws and 
treaties, national and international standard-making organiza-
tions to write rules for safe use, national testing laboratories 
to test the chemicals, national testing laboratories to test and 
approve agent systems, national and international certiﬁcation 
bodies for approvals.
 
This process is lengthy, expensive and often has to be re-
peated country-by-country to meet different national standards. 
While it may be onerous, it is important from the points of view 
of both ﬁre protection and the environment. Countries and re-
gions with high levels of regulatory supervision tend to avoid 
unapproved products, while those with less regulation have 
experienced difﬁculties with agents of questionable safety and 
effectiveness. Table 9.4 provides a listing of the clean extin-
guishing agents identiﬁed as suitable for use, within limitations, 
in ISO Standard 14520-1 and NFPA Standard 2001. This list 
includes all agents that are known to have been subjected to 
the appropriate approval processes at the time the list was com-
piled. Using an agent for an application for which it has not 
been approved can result in signiﬁcant loss of life and property. 
From an environmental point of view, any use of unapproved 
agents that are greenhouse gases may result in emissions that 
otherwise could have been avoided 
9.2.3.2 
Reﬁning the list of available gaseous alternatives to 
halon 1301
While Table 9.4 shows numerous halocarbon alternatives, the 
TEAP concluded that only three were commercially viable in 
1999: HFC-23, HFC-227ea and HFC-236fa (UNEP-TEAP, 
1999). A key characteristic of halon is its safety for use in occu-
pied areas, but TEAP concluded that HFC-125, HCFC Blend A, 
HCFC-124 and FIC-13I1 were unsuitable due to unacceptable 
toxicity. However, new exposure guidelines are being adopted 
in some jurisdictions that will allow the use of HFC-125 in oc-
cupied spaces under certain conditions (NFPA, 2003). 
 
Since 1999, FK-5-1-12 has become available. It has 
been listed as an acceptable alternative to halon under the 
US Environmental Protection Agency’s Signiﬁcant New 
Alternatives Policy (SNAP) programme (US EPA, 1994, 2002). 
It has also been included in the latest revision of the NFPA 
clean-agent standard (NFPA, 2004) and is expected to be in the 
next revision of the ISO standard (ISO, 2003). Systems have 
been approved by several testing and approval organizations 
and are now available. Additional technical information on FK-
5-1-12 and the other clean-agent alternatives to halon 1301 is 
available in the referenced ISO and NFPA documents.
 
Table 2.6 (see chapter 2) lists the environmental properties 
of the halocarbon agents deemed acceptable for safe human ex-
posure for use in normally occupied spaces: HFC-23, HFC-125,

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
HFC-227ea, HFC-236fa, FC-2-1-8, FC-3-1-10 and FK-5-1-12. 
It is important to note that:
• HFC-23’s high vapour pressure and low boiling point make 
it a unique replacement for halon 1301 in large-volume, 
low-temperature applications such as those found on the oil 
and gas industry on the North Slope of Alaska (Catchpole, 
1999);
• HFC-236fa has never been commercialized as a ﬁre extin-
guishing agent in ﬁxed systems;
• FC-2-1-8 and FC-3-1-10 are being withdrawn from the ISO 
standard and all PFCs are prohibited by the International 
Maritime Organization (IMO) for shipboard ﬁre extinguish-
ing systems (SOLAS, 2000).
9.2.3.3 
Available clean agents 
After elimination of the agents either found unsuitable for oc-
cupied spaces, withdrawn from standards, prohibited by IMO 
or not commercialized in ﬁre extinguishing systems, the list of 
potential gaseous total ﬂooding agents is reduced considerably, 
as shown in Table 9.5.
 
Comparing the list from Table 9.5 against the performance 
parameters in the 1989 HTOC report shows that the agents list-
ed in Table 9.5 are quite similar in terms of several parameters. 
For example, they are all gaseous agents that readily permeate 
obstructions, they are effective at concentrations safe for hu-
man exposure, they are effective for ﬂammable liquids, they 
are non-conductive and can be used around energized electrical 
equipment. The real differentiation in system performance is 
(1) space and weight, (2) cost, (3) greenhouse-gas effect and (4) 
speed of extinguishing. In addition, two other factors may be 
important in some instances: (5) demonstrated special capabili-
ties and (6) multiple supply sources. 
• Space, weight and cost: A comparison was made of the agent 
storage container weights, ﬂoor area occupied (footprint), 
volume occupied (cube) and costs of several types of sys-
tems to protect volumes of 500, 1,000, 3,000 and 5,000 m3 
under the rules of the IMO for the protection of shipboard 
machinery spaces (Wickham, 2003). The results are shown 
in Table 9.6, using a halon 1301 system as the basis for com-
parison. The following deﬁnitions apply to Table 9.6:
a. Weight includes the storage containers and contents but 
not the weight of piping, hangers, etc. 
b. Footprint is that area occupied by the agent contain-
ers deﬁned by a square or rectangle circumscribing the 
agent cylinder bank. 
c. Cube is that volume occupied by the agent containers 
deﬁned as the area multiplied by the height of the agent 
cylinders measured to the top of the valves.
d. System cost is the average selling price of the system 
components charged by a manufacturer to a distributor 
or installer, and includes agent, agent storage containers, 
actuators, brackets, discharge and actuation hoses, check 
valves, stop valves and controls, time delay, manually-
operated stations, predischarge alarms, pilot cylinders 
and controls. Cost does not include agent distribution 
piping and ﬁttings, pipe supports and hangers, actuation 
tubing and ﬁttings, electrical cables and junction boxes 
or labor to install, packing or freight.
• Greenhouse-gas effect: The GWPs of the agents (as listed 
in Table 2.6) provide a relative comparison of the direct 
greenhouse-gas emissions of ﬁre protection systems and 
do not take into account any effects from indirect emis-
sions. For most applications, the indirect effects are neg-
ligible compared with the direct effects. By contrast with

other sectors, the amount of energy required to operate ﬁre 
protection systems is trivial and largely unaffected by the 
agent used. This includes the impact of heating and cool-
ing the systems installed in buildings, as this is quite small 
compared to the direct effect of an annual emission rate of 
even 1%. Techniques such as TEWI and LCCP identify only 
negligible levels of change compared to evaluations based 
only on the GWPs of the agents. The notable exception is 
aviation. The added weight of any of the halon alternatives 
has an indirect emissions effect because of the additional 
fuel use during the life of an aircraft. 
• Speed of suppression: The discharge time for inert gas 
systems is in the order of 60 seconds or more. This is sig-
niﬁcantly longer than the discharge time of 10 seconds for 
halocarbon systems. Inert gas systems are therefore not rec-
ommended for areas where a rapidly developing ﬁre can be 
expected (Kucnerowicz-Polak, 2002). 
• Demonstrated special capabilities: There can be other per-
formance requirements that apply to speciﬁc applications for 
which alternatives may not have been tested. For example, 
Catchpole (1999) described the unique capabilities of HFC-
23 for deployment in high bay areas and in low ambient 
temperature conditions. Wickham (2002) described mul-
tiple special applications for HFC-227ea in military ship-
board and vehicle applications and the choice of HFC-125 
for both military vehicle and high-performance aircraft en-
gine protection. The comprehensive testing and evaluation 
of HFC-23, HFC-227ea and HFC-125 for these applications 
and others are well documented in the publications of the 
US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, 
2003). FK-5-1-12 became commercially available in 2002 
but has not yet been tested for some special applications. It 
has satisﬁed regulatory review under US EPA SNAP, NFPA 
and VdS, (VdS Schadenverhütung GmbH) and is pending 
at ISO. Market acceptance will depend on the comparative 
cost of the competing options. No estimates are available 
about how further restrictions on ozone-depleting substanc-
es and greenhouse-gases would affect agent choice in the 
future.
• Multiple supply sources: HFC-23, HFC-125 and HFC-227ea 
are manufactured by several companies in the US, Europe 
and Asia, and inert gas agents and systems are available 
worldwide from several competitive sources. FK-5-1-12 is 
available from one manufacturer in the US. Fixed systems 
utilizing these agents are available from several manufac-
turers.
9.2.3.1 
Abatement costs
The abatement costs for assessing ﬁre protection alternatives 
vary greatly depending upon speciﬁc assumptions that may 
or may not be applicable for any given situation. Harnish et 
al. (2001) assessed abatement costs for leakage reduction and 
recovery assuming a cost structure comparable to commercial 
refrigeration. The abatement cost was US$ 158,000 per ton of 
abated substance based on a projected 30% reduction of these 
emissions in 2010 and a 60% reduction in 2020. Harnish and 
Schwartz (2003) calculated an abatement cost to retroﬁt PFC 
3-1-8 ﬁxed systems with HFC-227ea in the EU assuming a 7% 
emission rate. The results were approximately 26 US$/tCO2-eq 
abated (27.53 /tCO2-eq). With a 2% emission rate, their result 
changes to approximately 130 US$/t CO2-eq abated. Godwin 
(2004) proposed three abatement options for future systems: (1) 
replacing up to 30% of HFC-227ea with inert gases by 2020; 
(2) replacing all HFC-227ea in Class B (ﬂammable liquids) 
applications with water mist by 2020; and (3) replacing up 
to 50% of HFC-227ea with FK 5-1-12 by 2020. The speciﬁc 
abatement costs range from approximately 14 to 57 US$/tCO2-
eq (4% discount rate) per year over the twenty-year lifetime. 
A ﬁfteen-year lifetime leads to a range of 17–70 US$/tCO2-eq 
per year. 
 
While Godwin (2004) provides these possible scenarios, 
they must be viewed as hypothetical. HFCs and inert gases have 
evolved as the most commonly used agents, having achieved a 
degree of equilibrium in terms of market applications and share. 
FK-5-1-12 has been commercialized and is now available but 
there is no basis for predicting the rate of its market acceptance 
or its effect on the already established equilibrium. Under these 
circumstances, it is impossible to quantify the reduction in the 
use or emissions of HFCs in ﬁre protection through 2015.
9.3 
Reducing emissions through the choice of 
portable extinguisher agents
9.3.1 
Regulatory requirements for portable 
extinguishers
Users almost always purchase hand portable ﬁre extinguishers 
to comply with ﬁre codes. In general, depending on the type of 
occupancy, ﬁre codes and regulations describe the hand por-
table ﬁre extinguisher requirements in terms of (1) either the 
charged weight or ﬁre test rating of the extinguisher and (2) 
the number of extinguishers required based on the ﬂoor area 
of the facility and the maximum travel distance to an extin-
guisher. Furthermore, most codes require extinguishers capable 
of extinguishing ﬁres in Class A and B fuels, often with the 
additional requirement that the extinguisher can be used safely 
around energized electrical equipment (NFPA, 1998 and UL, 
2000). Extinguishers suitable for Class A fuels are tested by ap-
proval laboratories on wood cribs, wood panels and excelsior 
material. Extinguishers suitable for Class B fuels are tested by 
approval laboratories on ﬂammable liquids in metal pans. The 
code requirements can be met either by employing an extin-
guisher capable of both Class A and Class B ﬁres or separate 
extinguishers, one for each type of ﬁre (Wickham, 2002).
9.3.2 
Agents existing at the time of the Montreal Protocol
The HTOC (1989) also developed an agent selection matrix for 
portable ﬁre extinguishers as follows: (1) effectiveness on ordi-
nary combustibles, (2) effectiveness on ﬂammable/combustible 
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   373

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
liquid ﬁres, (3) electrical conductivity, (4) ability to permeate, 
(5) range, (6) effectiveness to weight ratio, (7) secondary dam-
age (by extinguishing agent residue) and (8) cost.
 
Since none of the new halon alternatives were developed at 
the time of the 1989 report, the types of portable extinguishers 
considered in the matrix are regarded as not-in-kind technolo-
gies: carbon dioxide, multipurpose dry chemical, aqueous ﬁlm 
forming foam and water.
 
The matrix illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of the 
various types of portables, and reveals that each one has short-
comings that would limit widespread use as halon alternatives. 
• Water can be used for Class A fuels (ordinary combustibles) 
but has limited ability to permeate obstructions, poor ﬂam-
mable liquid extinguishing capability (Class B fuels) and 
limitations of use around energized electrical equipment 
(Class C ﬁres). Water leaves a residue but produces no di-
rect greenhouse-gas emissions (HTOC, 1999b).
• Carbon dioxide is effective on Class B and Class C fuels, 
but has poor effectiveness on ordinary combustibles (Class 
A ﬁres), (HTOC, 1999a), poor range and high weight to ef-
fectiveness ratio. Its direct greenhouse-gas emissions are 
negligible (HTOC, 1999b). 
• Multipurpose dry-chemical extinguishers, such as ammo-
nium phosphate-based powder, are rated for use on Class 
A, B and C ﬁres. They have a limited ability to permeate 
obstructions and can produce signiﬁcant secondary damage 
from agent residue. They produce no direct greenhouse-gas 
emissions (HTOC, 1999b). 
• Aqueous –ﬁlm forming foam (AFFF) extinguishers use wa-
ter-based formulations that contain surfactants to create a 
semi-stable foam. They are effective on Class A and B fuels, 
but have a limited ability to permeate and there are limita-
tions on use around energized electrical equipment. In ad-
dition, AFFF extinguishers leave a residue after discharge. 
They produce no direct greenhouse-gas emissions (HTOC, 
1999b). 
9.3.2.1 
Agents developed since the Montreal Protocol
Table 9.7 is an illustration of the clean agents developed for use 
in portable extinguishers since the Montreal Protocol. According 
to Wickham (2002), only HCFC Blend B and HFC-236fa have 
achieved any signiﬁcant level of commercialization and the 
manufacture of PFC-5-1-14 has been discontinued. FK 5-1-12 
is a newly developed agent capable of extinguishing Class A, 
B and C ﬁres. Extinguishers using FK-5-1-12 have negligible 
direct greenhouse-gas emissions (Taniguchi et al., 2003). Other 
blends of HCFCs are in use in portable extinguishers but the lit-
erature contains no information about commercial acceptance. 
All of the agents in Table 9.7 have had use limitations applied 
to them by the US EPA, which has found the agents “acceptable 
in non-residential uses only”. In effect, this precludes their use 
in residential applications (US EPA, 2003). The EPA uses the 
expression “residential” to differentiate from “commercial” ap-
plications.
9.3.2.2 
Options for prospective owners of portable 
extinguishers 
An end user is faced with making trade-offs between effective-
ness, cleanliness and cost because, given equal size, (1) halo-
carbons are most expensive and least effective and (2) multi-
purpose dry chemicals cost least but are most effective.
 
End users who would have purchased halon 1211 portable 
extinguishers to protect their facilities or equipment ﬁfteen 
years ago have three options today. (1) They can use an “in-
kind” halon 1211 alternative such as one of the new halocarbon 
agents. (2) They can use two extinguishers (to do the job of one 
halon 1211 unit): water for Class A ﬁres and carbon dioxide for 
Class B ﬁres and those around electrically energized equipment. 
(3) They can use a multipurpose dry-chemical extinguisher in 
situations where the agent residue can be tolerated.
9.3.2.3 
Progress with halocarbon portable extinguishers
Wickham (2002) compared the agent charge, ﬁre rating and 
average selling price of several types of extinguishers. This is 
shown in Table 9.8. The available data for extinguishers with 
FK-5-1-12 are limited for this comparison, as few portable ex-
tinguishers have been developed using this agent to date.
As an example, a commonly speciﬁed extinguisher is 2-A:10-
B:C rating, where “A” indicates it is suitable for use on Class A 
ﬁres and the preceding number indicates its degree of effective-
ness on those types of ﬁres as determined in testing by approval 
laboratories; “B” indicates it is suitable for Class B ﬁres and the 
preceding number indicates its degree of effectiveness on those

types of ﬁres; and “C” indicates it is safe for use around ener-
gized electrical equipment. Table 9.8 shows end users have a 
choice of using the ﬁve-pound multipurpose dry-chemical unit 
for an average end user cost of US$ 30 each, the 13.3-pound 
HFC-236fa unit for US$ 493, the 15.5-pound HCFC Blend B 
unit for US$ 415, or both a ten-pound carbon dioxide unit and a 
2.5 US gallon water extinguisher with a combined average end-
user cost of US$ 238. This is compared to a cost of US$ 223 for 
equivalent halon 1211 units prior to 1994 when they were still 
being manufactured.
 
History has shown that a large portion of the market place 
was willing to pay over seven times more to get a clean-agent 
halon 1211 unit rather a not very clean dry-chemical extin-
guisher (US$ 223/30=7.43). The current cost multiple of 13 to 
16 for the HCFC Blend B and HFC agents appears to be limit-
ing market acceptance to those applications where users con-
sider cleanliness a necessity.
9.4 
Additional abatement options for emissions 
9.4.1 
Responsible agent management
The signiﬁcantly reduced emission rates were achieved through 
a variety of actions within the ﬁre protection community. For 
example, both the United Kingdom and the United States have 
developed voluntary agreements between the government and 
the ﬁre protection industry that include speciﬁc actions by the 
ﬁre protection community and also include the speciﬁc codes 
and standards that must be followed (DETR and FIC, 1997; 
FEMA et al., 2002). While the speciﬁc form of implementa-
tion will differ according to the country or region depending on 
culture and legal traditions, the technical practices needed to 
minimize emissions will be the same. An explanation of these 
kinds of practices may be found in the agreements themselves 
and in the HTOC Technical Note #2 (1997), which also include 
important provisions for stored and stockpiled halons.
 
Another method chosen by some authorities is to use reg-
ulation to reduce emissions. For example, the International 
Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (Marpol 
73/78) prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone-depleting sub-
stances and the European Union requires that all halon systems 
and extinguishers, except those on a critical list, be decommis-
sioned.
9.4.2 
Importance of applying and enforcing codes and 
standards to minimize emissions
The UK and US agreements, and HTOC Technical Note #2, all 
make reference to the speciﬁc codes and standards that need to 
be followed in carrying out these provisions. Many, but not all, 
of these codes and standards have been discussed earlier in this 
chapter and have been an integral part of successful national 
programmes for reducing non-ﬁre emissions. The speciﬁc codes 
or standards are different in the UK and US agreements, but 
their use was key to the success of both countries’ programmes. 
The reader is encouraged to review the cited references to gain 
a better understanding of the types of codes and standards avail-
able, how they were applied and how their use produced emis-
sions reductions.
9.4.3 
End-of-life considerations for clean-agent systems 
and extinguishers
There are three distinct end-of-life considerations for clean-
agent ﬁxed systems and extinguishers: (1) end of useful life of 
the ﬁre protection application, (2) end of useful life of the ﬁre 
protection equipment and (3) end of useful life of the ﬁre pro-
tection agent.
 
Fixed systems protect speciﬁc volumes (rooms), often tele-
communications suites. Over the typical system life of 15 to 
20 years, the protected equipment may change many times, 
with the ﬁre protection system remaining in place. In special-
ized applications, such as aircraft and military systems, systems 
can remain in use for 25 to 35 years or longer (HTOC, 1994). 
Similarly, portable extinguishers meet a particular ﬁre code or 
level of safety and are not replaced unless the use of the space 
changes in a way that requires a different ﬁre protection capa-
bility. Portable extinguishers are generally required to undergo 
periodic pressure testing that involves removing the agent from 
the cylinder (NFPA 10), which is then recycled and redeployed. 
Estimates of the useful lifetime of portable extinguishers are 
between ﬁve to 25 years, depending upon regional factors

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
(HTOC, 1994). 
 
The current availability of halons is the direct result of a 
strategy to recycle, effectively manage, and allow trade of the 
existing supplies of halons. The objectives were twofold: to en-
able a production phase-out in advance of alternatives to impor-
tant national security and public safety applications, and to pre-
clude the need for any future new production and consumption. 
The current global trade in halons produced before the phase-
out is neither accidental nor a situation arising from oversupply. 
No exemptions to the halon production and consumption phase-
out have been requested, or are expected to be granted by the 
parties (HTOC, 1994). Halon’s positive market value provides 
a ﬁnancial incentive to minimize emissions. Alternatively, be-
cause halon released to the atmosphere is untraceable, policies 
that diminish halon’s value or make ownership a liability could 
result in increased emissions (UNEP-TEAP, 1998).
 
In countries or regions that have also placed export restric-
tions on the stores of halon, the only solution proposed has been 
destruction, often through a plasma arc or incineration process. 
To date, there has been only one known potentially economical-
ly feasible process described in the literature to convert either 
halons or the halocarbon alternatives to other useful products 
(Uddin et al., 2004).
 
To date, there are no ﬁre-protection-speciﬁc proposals in 
the literature for managing the end of life of halocarbon agents 
other than halons (HTOC, 2002, page 6). However, the industry 
practices of capturing, recycling and reusing halons have carried 
over to all high value gaseous agents, including HFCs, HCFCs 
and PFCs. There is no reason to believe they will not also be ap-
plied to FK agents as they enter the market. In addition, because 
of their more complex chemistries, it appears unlikely that ha-
lon replacements will ever be as inexpensive as halons. As a re-
sult, there is both a market incentive as well as an industry cul-
ture favouring capture, recycle and reuse. Adherence to these 
practices, including certiﬁcation programmes, has been shown 
to minimize emissions and to limit the use of these agents to 
applications where their cleanliness is needed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Non-medical aerosols
Prior to the Montreal Protocol, CFCs, particularly CFC-11 
and CFC-12, were used extensively in non-medical aerosols 
as propellants or solvents. In developed countries today, more 
than 98% of non-medical aerosols now use non-ozone-deplet-
ing, low-GWP propellants (hydrocarbons, dimethylether, CO2 
or nitrogen). Some of the non-medical applications that previ-
ously used CFCs have also converted to not-in-kind technolo-
gies (spray pumps, rollers, etc.). These substitutions led to a 
total reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions of aerosol origin 
by over 99% between 1977 and 2001 (ADL, 2002; FEA, 2003). 
Although there are no technical barriers to the phase-out of 
CFCs, estimated consumption of CFCs in developing and CEIT 
countries was 4,300 tonnes in 2001 (UNEP, 2003a). 
 
The remaining aerosol products use either HCFCs or HFCs 
because these propellants provide a safety, functional or health 
beneﬁt for the users. In 2003, HFC use in aerosols represent-
ed total emissions of approximately 22.5 MtCO2-eq. Both the 
US and European aerosol trade associations and the Japanese 
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry project low growth 
over the next decade.
 
Technical aerosols are a group of pressurized products used 
to clean, maintain, ﬁx, test, manufacture, disinfect, or apply lu-
bricant and mould release agents to various types of equipment. 
Technical aerosols are used in a number of industrial and com-
mercial processes. In technical aerosols, HFCs are used most in 
dusters, where the substitution of HFC-134a by HFC-152a is a 
leading factor in reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. The sub-
stitution of HCFC-141b solvent by HFEs and HFCs with lower 
GWPs makes additional emission reductions possible in other 
technical aerosols. 
 
Safety aerosols and insecticides for planes and restricted 
areas continue to rely on HFC-134a because of its non-ﬂamma-
bility. Novelty aerosols generally use hydrocarbons, but some 
applications have been reformulated to HFC-134a in response 
to safety considerations. In consumer aerosols, the use of HFC-
152a is likely to increase in the US due to regulations for the 
control of ground-level ozone formation caused by the emission 
of hydrocarbons from these products. However, on a global ba-
sis, such HFC-forcing regulation is not common.
Solvents
The primary ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) traditionally 
used in solvent applications are CFC-113, 1,1,1-trichloroethane 
and, to a lesser extent, CFC-11 and carbon tetrachloride. The 
ozone-depleting solvents have a variety of end uses. However, 
this report focuses on the largest application – cleaning – which 
includes precision, electronics and metal cleaning. It is estimat-
ed that 90% of ozone-depleting-solvent use had been reduced 
through conservation and substitution with not-in-kind technol-
ogies by 1999 (no-clean ﬂux, aqueous or semi-aqueous clean-
ing, and hydrocarbon solvents). The remaining 10% of solvent 
uses are shared by several organic solvent alternatives. 
 
The primary in-kind substitutes for 1,1,1-trichloroethane 
and carbon tetrachloride are non-ozone-depleting chlorinated 
solvents such as trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene and 
methylene chloride. More recently, n-propyl bromide has be-
gun to be used in cleaning and adhesive applications, although 
there are concerns and uncertainties about its safety and ozone-
depleting potential.
 
The in-kind substitutes for CFC-113 and CFC-11 are ﬂuo-
rinated alternatives such as hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFC-
141b and HCFC-225ca/cb), perﬂuorocarbons (primarily C6F14), 
hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFC-43-10mee, HFC-365mfc and HFC-
245fa, HFC-c447ef) and hydroﬂuoroethers (HFE-449s1, HFE-
569sf2). These in-kind solvent substitutes cost more than the al-
ternatives, and so they are primarily used in applications where 
safety, performance (such as compatibility, selective solvency 
and stability) or other environmental considerations are crucial. 
In most of the cleaning applications, the ﬂuorinated solvents 
are used as blends with alcohols and/or chlorocarbons, thereby 
enhancing cleaning performance and reducing the overall cost 
of the solvents.
 
While HCFC-141b use in developed countries is rapidly 
decreasing, its use in developing countries and countries with 
economies in transition continues to increase due to low cost 
and widespread availability. HCFC-225ca/cb is currently used 
mainly in Japan and the US, but its use is expanding in develop-
ing countries.
 
PFC solvent use is constrained to a few high-performance 
niche applications due to its very limited solvency and high 
cost. Consumption is known to have decreased since the mid-
1990s as a result of replacement with lower-GWP solvents.
 
Although HFCs are available in all regions, they have been 
used as solvents primarily in developed countries because of 
their high cost and the concentration of use in high-tech indus-
tries. With increasing concern about their GWP, uses tend to be 
focused in critical applications with no other substitutes. It is 
thought that use has now peaked at current levels and may even 
decline in the future.
 
Emission reduction options for solvent applications fall into 
two categories: 
(1) Improved containment in existing uses: New and retroﬁtted 
equipment can signiﬁcantly reduce emissions of all solvents. 
Optimized equipment can reduce solvent consumption by 
as much as 80% in some applications. Due to their high 
cost and ease of recycling, the ﬂuorinated solvents can be 
recovered and reused by the end-users or their suppliers. 
(2) Alternative ﬂuids and technologies: A variety of organic 
solvents can replace HFCs/PFCs and ODSs in many 
applications. Caution is warranted prior to the adoption 
of any alternatives for which the toxicity proﬁle is not 
complete. These alternative ﬂuids include compounds 
with lower GWPs such as traditional chlorinated solvents, 
hydroﬂuoroethers (HFEs), and n-propyl bromide (nPB)

if its use continues to be allowed under the Montreal 
Protocol. The numerous not-in-kind technologies, including 
hydrocarbon and oxygenated solvents, are also viable 
alternatives in some applications. In a limited number of 
applications, no substitutes are available due to the unique 
performance characteristics of the HFC or PFC for those 
applications.
HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 production
Triﬂuoromethane (HFC-23 or CHF3) is generated as a byproduct 
during the manufacture of chlorodiﬂuoromethane (HCFC-22 or 
CHClF2). HCFC-22 is used as a refrigerant in several different 
applications, as a blend component in foam blowing and as a 
chemical feedstock for manufacturing ﬂuoropolymers such as 
polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE). While the Montreal Protocol 
will eventually phase out the direct use of HCFC-22, its use as 
a feedstock will be permitted indeﬁnitely because it does not 
involve the release of HCFC-22 to atmosphere. 
 
HCFC-22 is produced in several developed and develop-
ing countries. The US, EU, Japan, China, India, and Korea are 
major producers of HCFC-22. HFC-23 is formed at the reactor 
stage of the manufacture of HCFC-22 as a result of over-ﬂuori-
nation. Its formation is dependent upon the conditions used in 
the manufacturing process and varies from 1.4 to 4.0 % of the 
production of HCFC-22 so that, while it is possible to reduce its 
formation by optimizing process conditions, it is not possible 
to eliminate the production of HFC-23. In a number of plants, 
HFC-23 is destroyed by thermal oxidation. The cost of reduc-
ing emissions varies signiﬁcantly depending on the option used 
and will vary from plant to plant depending on the particular 
baseline situation. 
 
Global emissions of HFC-23 increased by an estimated 12% 
between 1990 and 1995 as a result of a similar increase in glob-
al production of HCFC-22. However, due to the widespread im-
plementation of process optimization and thermal destruction, 
this trend in HFC-23 emissions from developed countries has 
not continued and, since 1995, emissions have decreased as a 
proportion of production levels in those countries. On the other 
hand, HCFC-22 production has increased very rapidly in China 
and India in the last few years and global emissions of HFC-23 
are still increasing.
 
Options for further emission reduction include: 
(1) Process optimization at additional facilities: In fully 
optimized processes, average HFC-23 generation can be 
reduced to as little as 1.4% of production. However, actual 
achievements vary for each facility and it is not possible to 
completely eliminate HFC-23 emissions by this means.
(2) Capture and destruction: Thermal oxidation is an effective 
option for the abatement of HFC-23 byproduct emissions. 
Destruction efﬁciency can be >99.0% with measurements 
at one facility indicating the destruction of 99.9% of the 
HFC-23 but the impact of the “down-time” of thermal 
oxidation units on emissions needs to be taken into account. 
Several facilities in the EU, Japan and the US have already 
implemented this option.
Destruction of byproduct emissions of HFC-23 from HCFC-
22 production has a reduction potential of up to 300 MtCO2-
eq per year by 2015 and speciﬁc costs below 0.2 US$/tCO2-
eq according to two European studies in 2000. Reduction of 
HCFC-22 production due to market forces or national policies, 
or improvements in facility design and construction also could 
reduce HFC-23 emissions.

10.1 
Introduction
Chapter 10 assesses the remaining or “miscellaneous” ODS-
replacement applications where greenhouse-gas emissions 
have been identiﬁed. These applications are in the non-medical 
aerosols and solvents sectors. The majority of substitutes in 
these sectors are ozone- and climate-safe alternatives, except 
for some limited use of HFCs, HFEs and PFCs for technical or 
safety purposes. A few additional niche applications of ODSs 
with possible greenhouse-gas replacements are also identiﬁed 
but there is insufﬁcient literature available to evaluate the 
global status of replacements, or of current or future emissions. 
Emissions from ﬂuorocarbon production are considered, and 
a detailed evaluation is made of HFC-23 byproduct emissions 
from HCFC-22 production. The use of PFCs and SF6 as ODS 
substitutes is also considered but the vast majority of emissions 
are found in sectors or applications that have never used 
ODSs. 
10.2 
Non-medical aerosols (including technical, safety, 
consumer and novelty aerosol products)
Aerosol products use liqueﬁed or compressed gas to propel ac-
tive ingredients in liquid, paste or powder form in precise spray 
patterns with controlled droplet sizes and amounts. Some aero-
sol products use the propellant as the only active ingredient, an 
example being dusters. Typical products use an aerosol propel-
lant that is a gas at atmospheric pressure but is a pressurized 
liquid in the can. The phase change from liquid to gas allows a 
high level of active ingredient per unit of propellant to be ex-
pelled from the aerosol can.
  
The ﬁrst aerosol product was developed during World War 
II as a result of efforts to control tropical disease. Controlled-
release aerosol products distributed DDT insecticide to small 
enclosed areas (e.g. rooms, tents, etc.) to control mosquitoes. 
  
The aerosol sector grew extensively worldwide after 1945. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, the vast majority of these spray prod-
ucts used CFC-12 as a propellant or CFC-11 as a solvent. The 
publication of the Rowland-Molina theory in 1974, the ban-
ning of CFCs in most aerosols in the United States, Denmark, 
Sweden and Norway in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the 
ratiﬁcation and implementation of the Montreal Protocol have 
led to aerosol reformulations without CFCs. More than 10 bil-
lion aerosol products were used worldwide in 2001 (UNEP, 
2003a). 
 
In developed countries, more than 98% of the conversions 
of non-medical aerosols encouraged by the Montreal Protocol 
have been to ozone- and climate-safe propellants: hydrocar-
bons (HC), dimethylether (DME), CO2, or nitrogen (N2). (In the 
aerosol industry, the terms “hydrocarbons” or “HAPs” (hydro-
carbon aerosol propellants) refer more speciﬁcally to the natu-
ral gas liquids: n-butane, propane, and iso-butane.) In addition, 
where this is feasible and where they are effective in use, many 
aerosol products have been replaced by not-in-kind substitutes. 
Over time, these have included ﬁnger or trigger spray pumps, 
sticks (deodorants, insect repellents), rollers, brushes, and cloth. 
This substitution process led to a total reduction of greenhouse-
gas emissions from aerosols by over 99% in the US between 
1977 and 2001 (ADL, 2002), and the same reduction in Europe 
between 1988 and 2002 (FEA, 2003). 
  
Those remaining products made with either HCFCs (in 
developing countries where the use of HCFC-22 and HCFC-
142b is allowed until 2040) or HFCs (HFC-152a, -134a) are 
niche products where safety or other environmental consider-
ations such as tropospheric ozone are a crucial issue. HCFC-22 
and HCFC-141b, which were once considered to be replace-
ments for CFCs, are in minimal use today in aerosol production 
(UNEP, 2003a). However, developing countries in general do 
not have prohibitions on the use of HCFCs in aerosols. HCFC-
22 and HCFC-141b therefore have some limited applications 
in non-medical aerosol products requiring low ﬂammable 
propellants or solvents. HCFC-22 is much cheaper than 134a. 
HCFC-141b, however, is a strong solvent so it is usually used 
in blends. Table 10.1 provides an overview of the non-medical 
aerosol propellant alternatives.
 
Although there are no technical barriers to the transition 
from CFCs to alternatives for non-medical aerosol products, the 
estimated consumption of CFCs in developing countries and 
countries with economies in transition was still 4,300 tonnes in 
2001 (UNEP, 2003a). 
  
Most of the remaining aerosol products use either HFCFs 
or HFCs because these propellants provide an important 
safety, functional, or health beneﬁt for the users. The Code of 
Practice on HFC Use in Aerosols of the FEA (European Aerosol 
Federation) and the responsible use practices of the trade group 
for the US aerosol industry (the Consumer Specialty Products 
Association) insist that HFCs should only be used in aerosol 
applications where there are no other safe, practical, economic 
or environmentally acceptable alternatives. The use of HFCs in 
aerosols is also limited further by cost. HFCs are between ﬁve 
and eight times more expensive than HCs. Table 10.2 contains 
estimates of total current and projected use of HFCs by region. 
  
In 2003, HFC use in non-medical aerosols represented total 
emissions in the range of around 22 MtCO2-eq: approximate-
ly 9 MtCO2-eq for the US, 6 MtCO2-eq for the EU, and 2.5 
MtCO2-eq for Japan (ADL, 2002; FEA, 2003; METI, 2004). It 
is estimated that emissions in 2010 will be around 23 MtCO2-
eq (ADL, 2002; FEA, 2003, METI, 2004). Both American and 
European aerosol trade associations and the Japanese Ministry 
of Economy, Trade and Industry expect low levels of growth in 
overall GWP-weighted emissions as a result of the introduction 
of HFC-152a in a number of applications currently using HFC-
134a. Banking is not an issue for the aerosol sector. Products 
are generally used within 2 years or less after ﬁlling. 
 
Key products using HFCs and HCFCs are listed in the next 
section, with a discussion of each product’s efﬁcacy, safety/
health impact, volumes, growth pattern and substitution or re-
formulation potentials.

10.2.1 
Technical aerosols 
Technical aerosols are a group of pressurized products used to 
clean, maintain, ﬁx, test, manufacture, disinfect, or apply lubri-
cant and mould release agents to various equipment. They are 
also used in a number of industrial processes.
10.2.1.1 Dusters 
Compressed gas “dusters” generate small jets of “clean” gas as 
a non-contact method for removing dust and other particulate 
matter. Dusters are packaged in the same manner as aerosols, 
but the propellant is the only active ingredient in the can. As 
a result, there is usually considerably more gas in these items 
than in other aerosol products. Dusters are formulated in such 
a way that they leave no residue. The fact that there can be no 
ﬂame suppression ingredients, e.g. water, increases 
the risk of ignition. 
 
Dusters are used to clear dust and lint and other light 
particulate material from delicate surfaces (photographic 
negatives and lenses, substrates in semiconductor “chip” 
manufacture, computer/tv screens, high quality optics, 
specimens for electron microscopy) and difﬁcult-to-reach 
places (the inside of Central Processing Unit “towers”, computer 
keyboards, the inside of cameras, photocopiers, ATMs). These 
products are used in laboratories, darkrooms, ofﬁces (both in 
homes and on the commercial scale) and workbenches. Dusters 
are very widely used by industrial entities for a wide range of 
applications. Dusters are also used by consumers in a similar 
broad set of applications in ofﬁces, homes and workshops.
  
Dusters have been reformulated in the US, Europe, and 
Japan, switching from CFC-12 to HCFC-22 (1989/1990) and 
later to HFC-134a or HFC-152a (1993/1994). In some coun-

tries, where its use as an aerosol propellant is not prohibited, a 
small amount of HCFC-22 is still used in dusters. It is estimat-
ed that dusters account for most HFC use in technical aerosols 
worldwide (excluding metered dose inhalers). The replacement 
of HFC-134a by HFC-152a, which has started in the US and 
is expected to develop in the EU and Japan, is a key factor in 
the stabilization of the reduction of the CO2-eq emission level 
in 2010. In Japan, emissions of HFC-134a from dusters have 
decreased from 2,137 metric tonnes in 2000 to 1,851 metric 
tonnes in 2003 as a result of the introduction of HFC-152a. 
HFC-152a use increased from 18 metric tonnes in 2000 to 371 
metric tonnes in 2003 (METI, 2004). 
  
HFC-152a is far less ignitable than hydrocarbons (HCs) and 
can be used in less ﬁre-sensitive applications. Generally, this 
use is acceptable in the ofﬁce environment where usage would 
be characterized by short blasts emitting small amounts of gas, 
and where contact with ignition sources is very limited. When 
used in machinery or equipment where an ignition source is 
present, the power should be turned off. In the US, Consumer 
Products Safety Commission (CPSC) standards do not require 
HFC-152a in a duster to be labelled as ﬂammable.
Reduction options for dusters
The expected decrease in emissions from HFCs in aerosols 
comes as a result of the replacement of HFC-134a by HFC-
152a in a number of technical aerosol applications. In addition, 
there are some cases of substitution in Europe by HCs in these 
products. This is a recent development and it remains to be seen 
how the safety issues with these gases will develop. 
 
Some reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can still be 
realized through the partial replacement of HFC-134a by HFC-
152a or dimethyl ether. Mixtures of these propellants can have 
acceptable ﬂammability characteristics for use in applications 
where ﬂammability is of less concern.
  
Some potential exists for the use of carbon dioxide (CO2) but 
this is very expensive. Compressed CO2 has the disadvantage 
of providing fewer blasts per can and CO2 products require 
expensive high-pressure canisters. The CO2 systems in the 
market today use very small aerosol cans (less than 20 gr). 
According to a recent analysis entitled “Dustometer Study”, 
it takes approximately twenty of the small CO2 aerosol cans 
to replace the cleaning power of one HFC-152a-based aerosol 
can (12 oz/340 gr) (DuPont, 2004). The assumption is that the 
emissions from the energy use needed to make the steel CO2 
canisters would at least equal the inherent emissions from an 
HFC duster. 
  
There is one not-in-kind solution for high-pressure industrial 
applications: electrical air compressors. They are used in large 
high-volume production environments. Their cost and total 
efﬁcacy make these systems useful in only a small number of 
situations. Rubber bulb brushes, if kept clean, are an alternative 
to dusters for low-pressure applications such as dusting lenses 
and dislodging dust from camera interiors. 
10.2.1.2 Other technical aerosols
This category of products accounts for considerably less HFC 
use and is unlikely to grow in the future.
  
Freeze sprays are used to test the electrical conductivity 
of components on circuit boards. They are used for thermally 
locating intermittently operating electrical components. They 
are used in static-sensitive areas and therefore need to be non-
ﬂammable. Freeze sprays are like dusters in that they are cans 
ﬁlled with propellant only. These cannot be anything other than 
non-ﬂammable propellants since they are mainly used to test 
electrically charged circuits that could ignite ﬂammable gases. 
 
Flux remover is a product used to clean excess ﬂux and 
solder residue from circuit boards and other electronic compo-
nents, especially in the repair of components and printed cir-
cuit boards. Since these are usually used near soldering irons 
or other sources of ignition, the formulations are made to be 
non-ﬂammable in order to safeguard worker safety. 
 
Mould release agents are used to release products moulded 
in plastic or synthetic ﬁbre from their moulds without damage 
to the end product. These aerosols are in the process of being 
re-formulated due to the phase-out of HCFC-141b in all aerosol 
solvent uses in developed countries. The substitution of HFCs 
by HCs is technically feasible for some applications when ap-
propriate consideration is given to ﬂammability risks. 
 
Electronic contact cleaners are used to dissolve and remove 
oil, grease, ﬂux, condensation and other contaminants quickly 
from delicate electronic circuitry and expensive electronic in-
strumentation. Contact cleaners combine quick drying and high 
dielectric solvency for residue-free cleaning. They are used 
to clean switchboards or circuitry, magnetic tape, printed cir-
cuit boards, electronic relays, and security equipment. Contact 
cleaning needs a completely non-ﬂammable formulation for 
use while equipment is in operation. It is therefore necessary to 
use pressurized cleaners containing non-ﬂammable solvents as 
well as non-ﬂammable propellants (in most cases HFC-134a). 
Reduction options for other technical aerosols
For cleaners (contact cleaners, ﬂux removers, etc.) and mould 
release agents, the substitution of the HCFC-141b solvent by 
hydroﬂuoroethers (HFEs) or HFCs with lower GWPs would 
reduce emissions without giving rise to substantial technical 
issues. The current cost of HFEs is higher than that of HFC-
134a or HFC-152a. Mixes of HFC-152a, or dimethyl ether in 
smaller percentages, with HFC-134a are also a practical solu-
tion. Compressed gas is also an emission reduction option but 
with an important technical limitation. Compressed gas does 
not ensure constant pressure level within the can and its use is 
therefore impractical once two-thirds of the product has been 
expelled. Some not-in-kind solutions (manual or mechanical 
sprays) have been tested without success due to their reduced 
efﬁciency; new solutions like bag-on-bag containers appearing 
in Japan could be adapted for uses not requiring high-pressure 
sprays.

10.2.2 
Safety aerosols 
Tyre inﬂators
Tyre inﬂators are made with latex sealants, a solvent acting as 
a diluent, and propellant. They are a safe, effective, and a far 
less strenuous alternative to changing a ﬂat tyre for people who 
cannot change a tyre or do not wish to risk doing so for safety 
reasons (e.g. busy trafﬁc or personal safety late at night and on 
dark roads). Many of the tyre inﬂators on the market initially 
used dimethyl ether or HCs as the propellant. However, after a 
series of accidents and fatalities while repairing tyres contain-
ing HC in an enclosed garage, many manufacturers of these 
products choose to reformulate and switch to the more expen-
sive HFC-134a and away from ﬂammable propellants.
It is estimated that more than 80% of inﬂators have now been 
converted to HFC-134a because of its non-ﬂammability, and 
sometimes because of local regulations. 
Safety signal horns
These products are made and used for safety purposes such as 
signalling on boats, and signalling in industrial plants and of-
ﬁces for emergency evacuations. Performance requirements in-
clude portability, and easy and non-electrical operation. In the 
United States, horns designed to meet US Coast Guard (USCG) 
speciﬁcations must be audible one mile (1.6 kilometres) from 
the point of activation. 
 
Insecticides for planes or restricted areas
The non-ﬂammability requirement for products used in certain 
areas (planes, source of energized equipment like transform-
ers etc.) leads to the use of HFC-134a, particularly for insec-
ticides. 
Reduction options for safety aerosols
Technically, HCs could be used to operate safety horns. However, 
because hydrocarbons are highly ﬂammable, they constitute an 
additional risk element in emergency situations or where ﬂame 
or ignition sources are frequently present. Whistles and mouth 
horns are substitutes but are not as loud as safety horns and 
therefore do not perform as well, especially in an emergency 
on the water or in burning buildings. Whistles and mouth horns 
can also be difﬁcult to use in smoke-ﬁlled environments. 
10.2.3 
Consumer aerosols (cosmetic and convenience 
aerosols)
In the US, in response to mandates from the Federal Clean Air 
Amendments of 1990, state regulations in 16 states have been 
adopted to limit the content of volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) in consumer products such as hair spray and deodor-
ants. A comparatively small number of aerosol products (less 
than 2%) have needed to utilize HFC-152a in order to comply 
with these standards. Unlike hydrocarbons and dimethyl ether, 
HFC-134a and HFC-152a are exempt from VOC controls be-
cause they do not participate in the reaction to form ground-
level ozone. 
  
While there will be an increase in the use of HFC-152a in 
US consumer aerosol products, overall the replacement of HFC-
134a by HFC-152a in dusters will result in the net decrease in 
emissions shown in Table 10.2. 
  
Currently, VOC controls in Europe do not exempt HFCs be-
cause of the broad deﬁnition of VOCs (boiling point < 250°C 
under standard pressure/temperature conditions). No transition 
from HCs to HFCs for consumer products is therefore expected 
in the EU. No other VOC regulations identiﬁed elsewhere in the 
world restrict the use of HCs in aerosols.
Reduction options for formulated consumer products 
HFCs are only used in consumer aerosol products in the US 
where no other options exist to meet product safety or VOC 
regulatory needs. Reformulation options are therefore very lim-
ited. In addition, since the overall world market for aerosols 
involves only very limited HFC use (less than 2% of all aerosol 
products), such use represents only a very small fraction of total 
HFC use, limiting the potential for substitution.
10.2.4 
Novelty products
Products in this category include artiﬁcial snow, silly string 
(spray of solid polymer material), and noise-makers. No data 
about global or regional HFC use are available for these ap-
plications. However, in the EU, this category could represent 
up to 25% of total HFC emissions for non-medical aerosols 
(Harnisch and Schwartz, 2003). Noise-makers are a variation of 
the safety horns discussed in section 10.1.2, but noise-makers 
are different in that they emit a less loud, deeper pitched sound. 
Additionally, the large majority (>80%) of horns marketed as 
noise-makers are made with HCs and not HFCs. Noise-makers 
with HFCs account for a very small percentage of the overall 
market. Artiﬁcial snow and string novelties were once marketed 
using ﬂammable propellants but, after highly publicized safety 
incidents, were reformulated to HFC-134a in many developed 
countries. Conversions to lower-GWP propellant mixes or HC 
propellants should be considered where safety permits. 
10.2.5 
Constraints on emission reduction potential
In the US, in order to comply with limits on tropospheric ozone 
levels pursuant to the Federal Clean Air Act, some state-level 
VOC emission restrictions are leading to the reformulation of 
hydrocarbon-propellant aerosol products, e.g. consumer aero-
sols, to HFC-152a.  In the EU, the recently proposed regulation 
on ﬂuorinated gases has not restricted HFC use in technical or 
safety aerosols but has proposed a ban on use in novelty prod-
ucts (according to the deﬁnition of novelty in Directive 94/48/
EC; for example artiﬁcial snow, silly string, decorative foams 
etc.).

10.2.6 
Emission reduction potential and abatement cost
Three separate studies estimate that the potential reduction in 
HFC non-medical aerosol emissions ranges from 10% to 88% 
(see Table 10.3 for more details) depending on the country and 
substitution costs (Harnisch and Gluckman 2001; METI, 2004; 
US EPA, 2004b). 
 
The abatement costs associated with using the HFC aerosol 
substitutes vary greatly from negative costs to over 150 US$2002/
tCO2-eq depending upon the applications and the required level 
of ﬁnal safety (ﬂammability).
 
A European study covering only 15 EU member states was 
conducted by Harnisch and Gluckman (2001) and projects 
an emissions reduction in 2010 of 39% for a cost of less than 
below 23 US$2002/tCO2-eq /tCO2-eq and an additional reduction 
of 39% for a cost of between 23 and 57 US$2002/tCO2-eq. 
Another European study by Harnisch and Schwartz (2003) is 
not referred to as it focuses only on novelty aerosols, which 
represent 25% of total HFC aerosol emissions in the EU.
 
The Japanese study by METI (2004) projects a 10% 
emission reduction potential for non-medical aerosols used in 
Japan, mainly as a result of the substitution of HFC-134a by 
HFC-152a. This study does not give any cost estimates.
 
The US EPA’s emission-abatement report (2004) has 
estimated emission reduction potentials in 2020 in the US, non-
US Annex I and non-Annex I countries. This study considered 
three abatement options: 
• replacement of HFC-134 as a propellant by HFC-152a;
• substitution of HFCs by hydrocarbon propellants (with 
safety concerns being properly handled); and
• substitution by not-in-kind packaging such as triggers, 
pumps, or sticks.
These substitutions represent a 57% reduction potential of total 
emissions in 2020, with reductions of 37%, 10% and 10% for 
each category respectively.
10.3 
Solvents
On an ozone-depletion-weighted basis, solvents constituted 
approximately 15% of the market for chemicals targeted for 
phase-out under the Montreal Protocol. In the case of the four 
ozone-depleting substances used as solvents – CFC-113, CFC-
11, carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (also known 
as methyl chloroform) – most use by far involved CFC-113 and 
1,1,1-trichloroethane in industrial applications and in industrial 
cleaning equipment. Carbon tetrachloride was predominately 
for dry-cleaning textiles, or in hand or maintenance cleaning. 
The three main end uses of CFC-113 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane 
in the past were metal cleaning, electronics cleaning, and 
precision cleaning. Metal cleaning usually involves removing 
cutting oils and residual metal ﬁlings from metal surfaces, and 
the maintenance and repair of equipment and machinery. This 
sector relied principally on 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Precision and 
electronics cleaning mostly used CFC-113. Precision cleaning 
mainly involves products that require a high level of cleanliness 
and generally have complex shapes, small clearances, and other 
cleaning challenges (UNEP, 1998). Electronics cleaning, or 
deﬂuxing, consists mainly of the removal of the ﬂux residue 
left after a soldering operation on printed circuit boards and 
other contamination-sensitive electronics applications. Tables 
10.4 and 10.5 provide an overview of CFC-113 and 1,1,1-
trichloroethane solvent cleaning applications and market 
estimates. 
 
The Solvent Technical Options Committee (STOC) of 
TEAP estimates that 90% of ozone-depleting solvent use 
(based on the peak consumption of 1994-95) has been reduced 
by switching to not-in-kind technologies (UNEP, 1998). The 
remaining 10% of the market for ozone-depleting substances 
is shared by several organic solvent alternatives. In developed 
countries, almost all ozone-depleting solvents (CFC-113, 
CFC-11, carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-trichloroethane) have 
been replaced by either not-in-kind technology (no-clean ﬂux, 
aqueous, semi-aqueous or hydrocarbon solvents) or other

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
eliminated by 2015. In developing countries and countries with 
economies in transition, the use of ozone-depleting solvents, 
especially HCFC-141b, continues. Although many of the larger 
international ﬁrms with operating facilities located in those 
countries have switched to non-ozone-depleting technology, few 
small or medium enterprises have completed the transition. 
 
The primary in-kind substitutes for 1,1,1-tricholorethane have 
been the chlorocarbon alternatives such as trichloroethylene, 
perchloroethylene and methylene chloride. These substitutes 
have very low (0.005-0.007) ozone-depletion potential, and 
similar cleaning properties (UNEP, 1998). These chemicals 
were widely used for cleaning in the past until toxicity concerns 
resulted in switches to ozone-depleting substances. In addition, 
a brominated solvent – n-propyl bromide – was recently 
introduced. It has similar properties and has acquired a deﬁnite 
market share of organic solvents for deﬂuxing, general cleaning 
and adhesives applications. 
 
The in-kind substitutes for CFC-113 and CFC-11 are 
ﬂuorinated alternatives such as hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons 
(HCFC-141b and HCFC-225ca/cb), perﬂuorocarbons (primarily 
C6F14), hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFC-43-10mee, HFC-365mfc 
and HFC-245fa, HFC-c447ef) and hydroﬂuoroethers (HFE-
449s1, HFE-569sf2). HCFC-141b and HCFC-225ca/cb have 
properties similar to CFC-113 and CFC-11 and have therefore 
been preferred as alternatives where in-kind alternatives are 
required. In particular, the low cost and good solvency of HCFC-
141b initially allowed it to capture a signiﬁcant market share 
of CFC solvents. However, HCFCs are transitional substances 
due to their ozone-depleting potential. Their use is declining in 
developed countries but still increasing in developing countries 
(UNEP-TEAP, 2003).
 
Most of the electronic cleaning market converted to not-in-
kind alternatives such as no-clean processes, aqueous and semi-
aqueous cleaning. Oxygenated solvents (e.g. alcohols, glycols, 
ethyl lactate) have also replaced CFC-113 in some portions of 
the electronics cleaning market. A very small segment of the 
market went to the HCFC alternatives and their azeotropic 
blends. Some of the metal-cleaning, particulate removal, 
medical and miscellaneous applications also switched to 
aqueous, semi-aqueous, HCFC and chlorocarbon alternatives. 
Recently, some of these applications have moved to a newer 
brominated solvent – normal propol bromide (nPB) – an ozone-
depleting substance not yet controlled by the Montreal protocol. 
However, uncertainty about the toxicity of nPB has limited its 
development in certain countries. Most of the displacement 
drying applications switched to either hot-air drying or alcohol 
drying systems. Some of the drying applications also switched 
to HCFCs. The cleaning applications (electronics, metal and 
particulate removal) and carrier solvents are the focus of this 
section. 
 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, PFCs (primarily C6F14) 
entered into some of the CFC-113 markets, with limited use in 
precision and electronics cleaning applications. Use was mostly 
limited to high-performance, precision-engineered applications 
where no other alternatives were technically feasible due to 
performance or safety requirements. Other alternatives such 
as HFCs and HFEs have been developed with better cleaning 
performance, signiﬁcantly lower global warming potential and 
comparable cost. PFCs are no longer considered technically 
necessary for most applications.
 
In the long-term, HFCs and PFCs are expected to acquire 
a very small share of the ozone-depleting-solvent market. The 
IPCC’s TAR has produced projections indicating that less than 
3% of the possible CFC solvent demand will be replaced by 
HFCs and PFCs (IPCC, 2001b). Some of the reasons for these 
low uses are the higher cost of HFCs and PFCs, the ready 
availability of other low cost and acceptable alternatives, and 
the limited solvency of the common soils in these solvents. 
Because of this limited use of HFC and other ﬂuorinated 
alternatives, the EU Commission did not include any restriction 
on HFC solvent use in its recent proposed regulation on certain 
ﬂuorinated gases (CEC, 2003).

10.3.1.1 HFCs
Two HFC solvent alternatives are available commercially: 
HFC-43-10mee (C5H2F10) and HFC-c447ef (heptaﬂuorocy-
clopentane; C5H3F7). Two other HFCs are coming onto the 
solvent markets.
 
HFC-43-10mee is a non-ﬂammable, non-VOC (US deﬁni-
tion) solvent with low toxicity (US EPA, 1998). The atmospher-
ic life of HFC-43-10mee is 15.9 years; it has a GWP of 1610 
(Chapter 2, Table 2.6). HFC-43-10mee readily forms azeotropes 
with many desirable alcohols, chlorocarbons and hydrocarbons 
to give blends enhanced cleaning properties (Merchant, 2001). 
It has better solvent properties than PFCs. The neat material 
is used as a carrier ﬂuid, and in particulate removal and other 
miscellaneous applications. The blends are used in applications 
such as precision cleaning, deﬂuxing ﬂip chips and printed wir-
ing board (PWB), and oxygen system cleaning. 
 
HFC-c447ef (C5H3F7) is a non-ﬂammable, non-VOC solvent 
(US deﬁnition) with a boiling point of 82°C (Zeon Corporation, 
2004). Its atmospheric lifetime is reported to be 3.4 years with 
a GWP of 250 (UNEP-TEAP, 2003)1. This is lower than most 
HFCs and some HFEs. However, because of its high freezing 
point (21.5°C), its neat use is limited. Some azeotropic mix-
tures with alcohol and ketone, or mixtures with terpenes, are 
provided for the degreasing metal parts and ﬂux cleaning of 
PWBs. The levels of use of this solvent are low and most cur-
rent users are in Japan, but marketing has started in the US.
  
Two other HFC candidates, although primarily developed 
for foam-blowing applications, have been promoted in some 
solvent applications. They are HFC-365mfc (pentaﬂuorobu-
tane) (Solvay, 2005) and HFC-245fa (pentaﬂuoropropane) 
(Honeywell, 2004). 
 
HFC-365mfc is a non-VOC solvent (US deﬁnition) with an 
atmospheric life of 8.6 years, a GWP of 782 (Table 2.6) and very 
low toxicity (exposure guide of 500 ppm). The manufacturer’s 
data sheet (Solvay, 2005) indicates that it is ﬂammable (ﬂash-
point of –27°C) and it is therefore used primarily in blends with 
other non-ﬂammable HFCs or HFEs to suppress its ﬂammabil-
ity. The current cost of HFC-365mfc is lower than that of other 
HFCs and HFEs and so it is being increasingly used in low-cost 
non-ﬂammable blends (with HFCs and HFEs) for some appli-
cations. 
 
HFC-245fa has a relatively low boiling point (15°C) and 
this limits its use in conventional degreasers. At present, its 
use has been limited to aerosol blends; its use in cold cleaning 
is also envisaged, though this is also limited due to the rapid 
evaporation rate. 
 
Although HFCs are available in all regions, they have been 
primarily used in developed countries due to their relatively

high cost and the concentration of use in high-tech industries. 
In addition, given the increasing concern about their GWPs, 
they now tend to be used in critical applications with no 
other substitute. Growth is therefore expected to be minimal 
(Merchant, 2001). 
10.3.1.2 PFCs
PFC solvents such as C6F14 (PFC-5-1-14) have physical 
properties similar to CFC-113. The atmospheric lifetimes and 
GWPs of PFCs are very high (C6F14 has an atmospheric lifetime 
of 3200 years and a GWP of 9140 (Table 2.6)). However, the 
very limited solubility of organic soils in these materials has 
restricted their use in cleaning to particulate removal and the 
cleaning of ﬂuorinated oils and greases (Agopovich, 2001). Due 
to the high cost, the availability of substitutes, and regulations 
restricting or banning use, PFC use has been limited primarily 
to niche applications in developed countries (Japan, US and 
Western Europe) with virtually no use in developing countries 
or countries with economies in transition (IPCC/TEAP, 1999). 
For example, in the US, PFC use is restricted to only those 
applications where no other alternative meets performance or 
safety requirements. In Germany, the use of CFCs, HCFCs, 
HFCs and PFCs is prohibited in solvents, except the pertinent 
authority can allow for high-quality applications provided 
negative environmental impacts and impacts on the climate are 
not expected and only if state-of-the-art technology does not 
allow the use of any ﬂuorine-free solvent (Germany, 1990).
 
The published data about the consumption of C6F14 are limited. 
Volumes are known to have decreased since the mid-1990s due to 
replacement with lower-GWP compounds (IPCC/TEAP, 1999). 
10.3.1.3 HCFCs
The only HCFC solvents used are HCFC-141b and HCFC-
225ca/cb, with ODPs of 0.12 and 0.02/0.03 (Chapter 1, Table 
1.2) and GWPs of 713 and 120/586 respectively (Chapter 2, 
Table 2.6). HCFC-141b is mainly used in foam blowing, with 
use as a solvent representing less than 10% of global use in 
2002 (UNEP-TEAP, 2003).
 
The use of HCFC-141b as a solvent is widely banned in 
developed countries, with a few derogations for technical 
reasons. Use from existing stockpiles is, however, allowed in 
the US.
 
In developing countries, the use of HCFC-141b is still 
increasing, especially in China, India, and Brazil. As economic 
growth rates are high, use could have exceeded 5000 tonnes in 
2002, even with process containment and recycling (AFEAS, 
2001). HCFC-141b is often the most cost-effective replacement 
for 1,1,1-trichloroethane or CFC-113. The decrease in developed 
countries, especially as use for foam blowing is phased out, will 
lead to production restructuring which could create shortages in 
2010–2015 (UNEP-TEAP, 2003).
 
HCFC-225ca/cb use has always focused on niche 
applications in precision cleaning and use as a carrier solvent 
because of its ozone-depleting potential and phase-out schedule; 
it is being gradually replaced by HFC, HFE and not-in-kind 
alternatives. Most sales are in Japan and the US (around 4,000 
tonnes in 2002); sales are increasing in developing countries 
(2,000 tonnes in 2002) (UNEP-TEAP, 2003).
 
The HCFC total consumption phase-out for developing 
countries is scheduled for 1 January 2040, with a freeze in 
consumption in 2015. But some countries are accelerating this 
schedule, especially for solvents (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand). 
Most of the uses of HCFC-141b and HCFC-225ca/cb can be 
technically replaced by partly introducing zero-ODP HFC or 
HFE, with a lengthy qualiﬁcation transition time for complex 
and crucial applications and sometimes at a high cost.
10.3.2 
Projected consumption / emissions 
Most solvent uses are emissive in nature, with a short inventory 
period of a few months to two years (IPCC, 2000). Although 
used solvents can and are distilled and recycled on site, all 
quantities sold are eventually emitted. The IPCC Good Practice 
Guidance recommends a default emission factor of 50% of the 
initial solvent charge per year (IPCC, 2000). A report by the 
US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) assumes that 
90% of the solvent consumed annually is emitted to the atmo-
sphere (US EPA, 2004a). Consequently, the distinction between 
consumption and emission is typically not signiﬁcant for these 
applications.
 
The US EPA has projected global emissions of HFCs and 
PFCs from solvent uses as shown in Table 10.7 (US EPA, 
2004a). PFC emissions are assumed to decline linearly until 
they are essentially no longer used in solvent applications in 
2025.

10.3.3 
Emissions reduction options
Most of the new solvent handling equipment is designed to 
ensure very low emissions, partly because of the higher cost of 
the HFC, PFC and HCFC solvents and partly due to increased 
environmental awareness and regulations in some countries 
for all solvents requiring zero or low emissions. The new tight 
machines generally have higher freeboards, dual temperature 
cooling coils, automated work transport facilities, welded 
pipe joints, hoods or sliding doors, and superheated vapour 
drying systems. Likewise, it is possible to reduce emissions 
to a minimal level by implementing good handling practices, 
such as reducing drag-out losses of solvent from the system by 
keeping the workload in the vapour zone long enough to drain 
and drop any entrapped or remaining solvent (UNEP, 1998). It 
is also possible to minimize evaporative losses by improving 
the design of solvent bath enclosures and of vapour-recovery 
condensing systems (March, 1998). 
10.3.3.1 HFCs, PFCs, HCFCs emission reduction
In tests with both new degreasers and retroﬁtted degreasers with 
speciﬁed enhancement features, measurements of HFC, PFC 
and HCFC solvent emissions showed that there was a decrease 
of as much as 80% (Ramsey, 1996). Another study indicated 
that retroﬁtting a vapour degreaser with an open-top area of  3.6 
meters square (13 square feet) can, in combination with proper 
maintenance, reduce emissions from a solvent process by 46 to 
70 percent, depending on the speciﬁc retroﬁt methods chosen 
(Durkee, 1997). With higher-cost ﬂuorinated solvents, the pay-
off from upgrading an old degreaser to a new degreaser standard 
is estimated to be > 62% (rate of return with break-even in less 
than 2 years) (Ramsey, 1996). 
10.3.3.2 Alternative ﬂuids (chlorinated solvents, HFE-449s1, 
HFE-569sf2 HFE-347pcf, n-propyl bromide) 
In some cleaning applications, lower-GWP solvents can be 
used to replace higher-GWP solvents. These options include 
the use of lower-GWP HFCs to replace the use of PFCs and 
higher-GWP HFCs. Similarly, with very few exceptions, the 
non-ozone-depleting solvents can be used as alternatives to 
HCFCs.
 
Cleaning processes using halogenated alternative ﬂuids, 
with the exception of n-propyl bromide (due to the higher 
vaporization temperature compared to chlorocarbons), are 
typically similar to the processes they replace with respect to 
energy use (ADL, 2002). Consequently, these aspects are not 
assessed for each option. 
 
Fluids that are alternatives to both HFCs/PFCs and ODSs 
include:
Chlorinated solvents 
Chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane (methylene chlo-
ride), trichloroethene (trichloroethylene) and tetrachloroethene 
(perchloroethylene) have been used for decades in cleaning ap-
plications (Risotto, 2001). The implementation of the Montreal 
Protocol motivated a return to the use of these traditional sol-
vents. Chlorinated solvents are used as replacements for CFCs, 
1,1,1-trichloroethane and HCFCs in a variety of cleaning ap-
plications due to their high solvency. While the higher boiling 
points of trichloroethene (87°C) and tetrachloroethene (121°C) 
limit their use in some applications, they also provide an advan-
tage in cleaning some soils such as resins and waxes (Risotto, 
2001). However, in some instances, the solvent strength of the 
chlorinated solvents may cause incompatibility with the com-
ponents to be cleaned.
 
Direct greenhouse-gas emissions from the use of chlorinated 
solvents are much lower than those from the products they 
replace due to their very low GWPs.
 
Chlorinated 
solvents 
are 
non-ﬂammable 
but 
have 
toxicological proﬁles that require low exposure guidelines. 
The 8-hour exposure guidelines for dichloromethane, 
trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene are 50 ppm, 50 ppm and 
25 ppm respectively (Risotto, 2001). Worker exposure to these 
solvents needs to be minimized in order to use them safely. 
Many regions have placed restrictions on the handling, use and 
disposal of chlorinated solvents (Risotto, 2001). The EU has 
reclassiﬁed trichloroethylene as carcinogenic (OJ, 2003).  
 
Chlorinated solvents are among the lowest-cost solvents and 
are widely available in virtually all regions (UNEP, 2003b).
Hydroﬂuoroethers
HFE-449s1, HFE-569sf2, HFE-449s1 and HFE-569sf2 are seg-
regated hydroﬂuoroethers with the ether oxygen separating a 
fully ﬂuorinated and a fully hydrogenated alkyl group. Both of 
these compounds are used as replacements for CFCs and HCFCs. 
The pure HFEs are limited in utility in cleaning applications due 
to their mild solvent strength. However, HFEs are also used 
in azeotropic blends with other solvents (such as alcohols and 
trans-1,2-dichloroethylene) and in co-solvent cleaning processes, 
giving them broader cleaning efﬁcacy (Owens, 2001).
 
As a result of the low GWPs of these HFEs, the direct 
greenhouse-gas emissions from them are signiﬁcantly reduced 
compared to the products they replace (GWP of 56 and 397 
for HFE-569sf2 and HFE-449s1 respectively; see Table 2.6 in 
Chapter 2). 
 
HFE-449s1 and HFE-569sf2 are non-ﬂammable and have 
relatively high exposure guidelines (750 ppm and 200 ppm 
respectively), allowing them to be used safely in many cleaning 
applications (Owens, 2001).
 
These HFE compounds are available in most regions. The 
relatively high cost of these materials limits their use compared 
to lower-cost solvents such as the chlorinated solvents and 
hydrocarbons (UNEP, 2003b).
HFE-347pcf
This compound is a non-segregated hydroﬂuoroether with oxy-
gen separating two partially ﬂuorinated alkyl groups. The mate-
rial is a new compound and has only recently become commer-
cially available. Very little information is available regarding 
the performance of this material in cleaning applications.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Normal-propyl bromide
Normal-propyl bromide (nPB) is a non-ﬂammable, brominated 
alkane. Its high solvent strength makes it effective in a vari-
ety of cleaning applications, including both vapour degreasing 
and cold cleaning (Shubkin, 2001). In some instances, n-propyl 
bromide may be incompatible with the components to be 
cleaned (Shubkin, 2001).
 
The direct greenhouse-gas emissions from n-propyl 
bromide are very low due to its very low GWP. The ODP of 
n-propyl bromide varies depending upon the latitude at which 
it is emitted. The current calculations indicate a range of ODPs 
from 0.013 to 0.105 (WMO, 2002). 
 
Normal-propyl bromide has low acute toxicity but its 
complete toxicological proﬁle necessitates a low exposure 
guideline. Current exposure guidelines set by n-propyl bromide 
manufacturers range from 5 to 100 ppm (US EPA, 2003b). 
However, recent toxicological studies continue to raise concerns 
regarding its chronic toxicity (both reproductive and central 
nervous system effects), causing some organizations to suggest 
that even lower exposure guidelines are required to protect 
workers (CDHS, 2003). The EU has decided to reclassify its 
toxicity as altering fertility and dangerous for the foetus (OJ, 
2004).  
 
Normal-propyl bromide is available in most regions, 
including Asia, with local production in China (UNEP, 2003b). 
World production capacity for the manufacture of nPB is 
increasing, although consumption is currently stable. This is 
resulting in a lowering of bulk prices to a level comparable to 
the upper range of chlorinated solvents (UNEP, 2003b).
10.3.3.3 Not-in-kind options
These are numerous, and include no-clean, aqueous, hydro-
carbon and oxygenated solvents, and they correspond to the 
fragmented market with a large number of small users in very 
diverse industries. Each presents “trade-offs” between effec-
tiveness in use, cost, safety, and environmental properties.
No-clean applications
The use of no-clean ﬂux is the preferred option in electronics 
cleaning and can be used for practically all types of printed cir-
cuit boards, even for most applications in the aerospace, aero-
nautics and military sectors (given the crucial reliability and 
safety issues). It is even used in the vast majority of high-tech 
printed circuit boards for automotive controls (>70%). But this 
approach requires very tight control of incoming materials, 
adapted chemicals for soldering and skilled operators to mas-
ter the process. Overall, industry experts report 85% of printed 
circuit boards are assembled with a no-clean process, in devel-
oped as well as in developing countries.  Total process costs are 
reduced and environmental impact is very low with no direct 
greenhouse-gas emissions.
Hydrocarbon solvent cleaning
This process has proven a good solution with parafﬁn hydro-
carbon formulations; cleaning is efﬁcient but the non-volatile 
or less-volatile residue can be incompatible with some down-
stream manufacturing or ﬁnishes. Some cases of materials 
incompatibility are also known. Environmental impact is low 
(low GWP, no ODP) but these solvents are generally classiﬁed 
as VOCs. Their toxicity is also low. Due to their ﬂammability 
(ﬂashpoint > 55°C), they have to be used in open tank equip-
ment at a temperature at least 15°C below their ﬂashpoint. After 
cleaning, rinsing has to be done using fresh solvent. To reduce 
solvent consumption, on-site recycling with vacuum distilla-
tion is recommended. In some cases, safety considerations and 
emissions reduction require a closed machine with a vacuum 
system. This is not always compatible with high-throughput 
processes. Use in precision mechanics (injectors, bearings etc.) 
has developed in the last 3 years, but it involves a drastic change 
of process, and a medium to high investment, as well as good 
operator training. 
Oxygenated solvent cleaning
Oxygenated organic solvents are compounds based on 
hydrocarbons containing appendant oxygen (alcohols and 
ketones), integral oxygens (ethers), or both (esters). These 
substances have been used for many years in diverse cleaning 
applications. Their cost and environmental impact are low 
(low GWP, no ODP), except they are classiﬁed as VOCs and 
may contribute to ground-level ozone pollution. Some of the 
oxygenated compounds are ﬂammable as neat product or the 
mixture may become ﬂammable in use. Precautions for handling 
ﬂammables must therefore be considered, e.g. explosion-proof 
equipment. 
Aqueous cleaning
These processes can be good substitutes for metal degreasing 
or even precision cleaning when corrosion of the materials is 
not an issue. For some tasks, where ﬁnish is a crucial issue, the 
number of required washing and rinsing baths, and the quality of 
the water, might be a deterrent. The availability of good-quality 
water and water disposal issues need to be addressed from the 
outset of process design. Aqueous cleaning processes have low 
environmental impact (not VOCs, low GWP, and no ODP) and 
low toxicity. The total TEWI can be equivalent to low-GWP 
solvent processes, as energy for drying has to be included in the 
total evaluation (ADL, 2002). It should be noted that a change 
from solvent to water cleaning does require good training of the 
workforce. The process is generally not forgiving; any error in 
operation or maintenance could result in corrosion and other 
quality problems. Investment costs can be high but operating 
costs are generally lower than those with solvent alternatives.
 
Table 10.8 provides an overview of the alternative ﬂuids and 
not-in-kind technologies, including environmental and techni-
cal data.
 
Like other solvents, the hydrocarbon and oxygenated sol-
vents lead to emissions that vary with the equipment used as 
well as with storing, handling and recovery procedures. The 
emission rate (per kg of parts cleaned for example) can decrease 
from 10 to 1 if containment in the equipment (upgrading or new

installation) is optimized and if care is exercised throughout the 
implementation of the process.
The ﬂammability of oxygenated and, to a lesser extent, hydro-
carbon solvents generally requires the use of higher-contain-
ment, ﬂammable-rated equipment, which leads to reduced 
emissions. In the case of hydrocarbons, the high boiling point 
induces lower volatility at the normal use temperature and, ac-
cordingly, low emissions. In many countries, environmental 
and VOC regulations have further pushed the emissions reduc-
tion from all solvent use and in particular from cleaning with 
organic or hydrocarbons solvents. 2
 
No-clean and aqueous cleaning processes do not emit any 
volatile compounds; however, for aqueous cleaning, total en-
ergy consumption (heating and drying) is a source of CO2 emis-
sions (ADL, 2002).
10.3.4 Emission reduction potential and abatement cost
Reduction potential
Four separate studies (two European, one Japanese and one 
from the US EPA) state a range for the potential reduction in 
HFC/PFC solvent emissions of 0% to 67%. See Table 10.9 for 
more details. The two European studies, which covered EU 
countries, were conducted by Harnisch and Gluckman (2001) 
and Harnisch and Schwartz (2003). The ﬁrst study stated an 
estimate for solvent emission reductions of 0.3 to 0.5 MtCO2-
eq (15% to 25%) depending upon the level of investment 
(abatement cost). The estimate in the second study was a 
solvent emission reduction potential of 60% (0.3 MtCO2-eq) by 
2010 using substitution with lower-GWP solvents.  For Japan, a 
recent study concludes there is no emission reduction potential 
for solvent uses below projected business as usual quantities 
(METI, 2004).
 
The US EPA’s recently published emission-abatement report 
(2004) has estimated emission reduction potentials in 2020 in 
the US, non-US Annex I and non-Annex I countries. This study 
looked at several abatement options and concluded that the 
global reduction potential was 58% (2.7 MtCO2-eq in 2020). 
Based on these abatement options, the reduction potentials are:

Abatement costs
The abatement costs associated with using the solvent 
alternatives vary greatly: from increased costs for adopting 
a new technology to cost savings due to reduced solvent 
consumption. Some options are cost-neutral. 
 
Harnisch and Gluckman (2001) assumed that abatement 
costs could range from <20 D1999 (23 US$2002) to a range of 
50 to 150 D1999 (57 to 170 US$2002), depending on the level of 
abatement achieved.
 
Harnisch and Schwartz (2003) estimate abatement costs 
for HFC/PFC solvent emission reduction in the EU to be  
cost-neutral based upon substitution with lower GWP solvents  
(0 D2000/tCO2-eq [0 US$2002/tCO2-eq] using a ten-year depreciation 
period and 10% discount rate).
 
The US EPA (2004) has estimated the abatement costs for 
several alternatives using a 4% discount rate:

HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production
In addition to emissions of a chemical during its use and dis-
tribution, there may also be emissions of the material that is 
being produced, the so-called “fugitive emission” or emissions 
of other byproduct chemicals generated during the production 
of a related chemical (e.g. HFC-23 from HCFC-22). Emissions 
from ﬂuorocarbon production processes have been estimated at 
approximately 0.5% of the total production of each compound 
(AFEAS, 2004). Emissions may vary because of the process 
used or destruction technology employed. However, because 
manufacturers have an incentive to minimize lost product, and 
emission rates are already reported to be very low, fugitive 
emissions are assumed to be insigniﬁcant compared to emis-
sions from consumption. In contrast, byproduct emissions of 
HFC-23 from HCFC-22 are signiﬁcant and well documented. 
 
Triﬂuoromethane (HFC-23 or CHF3) is generated as a by-
product during the manufacture of chlorodiﬂuoromethane 
(HCFC-22 or CHClF2). HCFC-22 is used as a refrigerant in 
several different applications, as a blend component in foam 
blowing and as a chemical feedstock for manufacturing syn-
thetic polymers. In developed countries, the phase-out of 
HCFC-22 consumption scheduled under the Montreal Protocol 
will occur by 2020 because of its stratospheric ozone-depleting 
properties. Feedstock production, however, will be allowed to 
continue indeﬁnitely because it does not involve the release of 
HCFC-22 to atmosphere in the same way as the dispersive uses. 
Consumption in developing countries will be phased out over a 
longer time period, using consumption (and production) in the 
year 2015 as a baseline.
 
HCFC-22 is produced in several developed and developing 
countries. The USA is a major world producer of HCFC-22, 
with three plants and approximately one-third of all developed-
country production. There are ten manufacturing plants for 
HCFC-22 in the EU, with total capacity estimated at 184,000 
metric tonnes; the reported levels of production are very close 
to this capacity (Irving and Branscombe, 2000; EFCTC, 2001; 
UNEP, 2002). Japan is another large producer of HCFC-22, 
with a reported production of 77,310 metric tonnes in 2003, 
and production in other Asian countries (notably China, India 
and Korea) has increased dramatically in recent years. There 
are now 19 HCFC-22 producers in China with a total capacity 
of 200,000 metric tones. They produced 177,000 metric tonnes 
in 2003 (CAOFSMI, 2003). Table 10.10 shows the historic and 
projected time series for global HCFC-22 production.
 
Triﬂuoromethane (HFC-23) is formed at the reactor stage 
of the manufacture of chloro-diﬂuoromethane (HCFC-22) as 
a result of over-ﬂuorination. Its formation depends upon the 
conditions used in the manufacturing process and varies from 
1.4% to 4.0% of the production of HCFC-22 so that, while it is 
possible to reduce its formation by optimizing process condi-
tions, it is not possible to eliminate the production of HFC-23.

In a number of plants, HFC-23 is destroyed by thermal oxida-
tion, and emission tests have shown this to be highly effective 
(Irving and Branscombe, 2000). The cost of reducing emissions 
varies signiﬁcantly depending on the option used and will vary 
from plant to plant depending on the particular situation. 
Business-as-usual emissions prior to 2015
Global emissions of HFC-23 increased by an estimated 12% 
between 1990 and 1995, due to a similar increase in global pro-
duction of HCFC-22 (Oram et al., 1998). However, the wide-
spread implementation of process optimization and thermal 
destruction has brought an end to this trend in HFC-23 emis-
sions and, since 1995, the emission trend has fallen below the 
increase in production (US EPA, 2003a).
 
While such abatement measures serve to reduce or elimi-
nate emissions, the quantity of HFC-23 actually produced is 
directly related to the production of HCFC-22 and so emission 
projections require a scenario for future HCFC-22 production 
volumes. These will depend on the consumption of HCFC-22 in 
developed countries, which is declining, and the consumption 
in developing countries and global demand for ﬂuoropolymers 
feedstock (UNEP-TEAP, 2003), both of which are increasing. 
The introduction in developed countries of additional controls 
on HCFC production after 2005 (over and above the required 
freeze) may have a neutral effect on production globally be-
cause it might stimulate investment plans for further HCFC-22 
capacity in developing countries (UNEP-TEAP, 2003).
 
Consumption in developed countries is expected to decrease 
as a consequence of increasingly stringent national and regional 
regulations. However, a scenario that followed the requirements 
of the Montreal Protocol exactly in these countries was adopted 
as the best estimate (business-as-usual case) in the most recent 
Scientiﬁc Assessment of Ozone Depletion (Fraser, Montzka et 
al., 2003). This envisages that, by 2015, consumption of HCFC-
22 in these countries will have fallen by a factor of 10 from the 
level in 2000-2003.
 
In the same region, over the 1990s, growth in demand for 
ﬂuoropolymer feedstock increased linearly at a rate of 5800 
tonnes yr-1, with a coefﬁcient of variance (R2) of 0.84 (Ceﬁc, 
2003; SRI, 1998). In the absence of other inﬂuences, this rate 
of increase could continue, leading to a doubling of feedstock 
demand for HCFC-22 in developed countries by 2015.
 
In the remaining countries of the world, production of 
HCFC-22 for both dispersive and feedstock uses has grown

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
rapidly in recent years. Over the period 1997 to 2001, produc-
tion for dispersive uses grew linearly at 20,000 tonnes yr-1, 
with a coefﬁcient of variance (R2) of 0.95, and feedstock use 
increased by 4100 tonnes yr-1 (R2 equal to 0.99) (Bingfeng 
et al., 2000; CCR, 2002; UNEP, 2002; UNEP-TEAP, 2003). 
Projected at these rates until 2015, the total global requirement 
for HCFC-22 could become about 710,000 tonnes yr-1, about 
40% of which would be for feedstock, compared with a total of 
490,000 tonnes yr-1 in the year 2000.
 
Up to 1995, records of atmospheric concentrations of 
HFC-23 (Oram et al., 1998) and global HCFC-22 production 
(McCulloch et al., 2003) indicate an emission intensity for 
HFC-23 of 20 kg per tonne of HCFC-22 production, or 2%. 
This suggests that there was substantial abatement of HFC-23 
emissions at that time, either by process optimization or by de-
struction; unabated emissions would be expected to be of the 
order of 4% (Irving and Branscome, 2000). In the “business-
as-usual” case for the period prior to 2015, it has been assumed 
that emissions from existing capacity will continue at 2% of 
HCFC-22 production and that new capacity will emit HFC-
23 at a rate of 4%. Consequently, emissions of HFC-23 could 
increase by 60% between now and 2015, from about 15,000 
tonnes yr-1 in 2003 to 23,000 tonnes yr-1.
10.4.1 
Relevant practices during life cycle
In the most commonly used process, chlorodiﬂuoromethane 
(HCFC-22) is produced by the reaction of chloroform (CHCl3) 
and anhydrous hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) in the presence of an 
antimony pentachloride (SbCl5) catalyst. The reaction takes 
place in a continuous-ﬂow reactor full of boiling liquid, prod-
ucts being removed from the reaction system as vapours. Two 
molecules of HF react with one molecule of chloroform to yield 
chlorodiﬂuoromethane, and reaction conditions are maintained 
to optimize HCFC-22 production but overﬂuorination (reac-
tion of HCFC-22 with HF) can occur, yielding HFC-23 (CHF3). 
Consequently, the vapour stream leaving the reactor con-
tains, in addition to HCFC-22 (CHClF2), HCFC-21 (CHCl2F), 
CHCl3, HF and some entrained catalyst (which are recycled to 
the reactor) and also HFC-23 (CHF3) and HCl. Separation of 
the hydrocarbon compounds is facilitated by the differences 
in volatility, which makes it possible to condense the chloro-
form and HCFC-21 for recycling and conversion to HCFC-22. 
It is technically feasible but not economical to convert HFC-
23, once formed, back into HCFC-22 (Merchant, 2001). Most 
of the HFC-23 produced is released from the reaction system 
at the control valve used to maintain the system pressure (the 
“condenser vent”) and, unless separated for collection, is then 
emitted to the atmosphere. 
 
This production process is relatively old (over 30 years) and 
has been extensively researched. However, the optimum oper-
ating conditions dictated by business economics are not neces-
sarily the conditions required to minimize HFC-23 production. 
The upper limit for HFC-23 emissions is of the order of 3 to 
4 percent of HCFC-22 production but the actual quantity of 
HFC-23 produced depends in part on how the process is oper-
ated and the degree of process optimization. There are a number 
of factors that affect halogen exchange of chlorine to ﬂuorine 
and thus affect the generation of HFC-23 in the reactor, and 
a signiﬁcant reduction in HFC-23 formation can be achieved 
by adjusting process operating conditions, including modifying 
process equipment. 
 
One variation on the liquid phase process is the so-called 
“swing” plant, designed to be capable of manufacturing either 
CFC-12 or -11 from carbon tetrachloride feedstock or HCFC-
22 from chloroform. Reactor designs for the two products 
are basically very similar, with differences only in operating 
pressure, operating temperature and heat load. However, the 
chemical engineering design of the whole plant is, of neces-
sity, a compromise between the ideals for the two products and, 
consequently, optimization of the process to minimize HFC-23 
production when producing HCFC-22 is intrinsically more dif-
ﬁcult than in a plant designed for HCFC-22 speciﬁcally. It is 
to be expected that swing plants will operate at the higher end 
of the HFC-23 production range (say 3 to 4% of HCFC-22 by 
mass).
 
The major exit point for HFC-23 from the reaction system in 
the HCFC-22 production process is the condenser vent, whence 
it can be discharged to the atmosphere after separation from 
useful products (HCFC-22 and HCl). There are four additional 
sources of HFC-23 emissions, three of which are inconsequen-
tial:
• Fugitive emissions from leaking compressors, valves and 
ﬂanges. Because the process is maintained under relatively 
high pressures, there is a potential for fugitive emissions 
from leaking equipment. However, there is a strong 
incentive to prevent leaks because of the noxious nature of 
the reactor contents and the potential for loss of valuable 
product (HCFC-22). Any leaks can usually be identiﬁed and 
repaired quickly and effectively. Fugitive emissions are a 
minor source; in two plants where they were measured, the 
HCFC-22 lost in this way amounted to less than 0.1% of 
plant production (Irving and Branscombe, 2000).
• Removal with the HCFC-22 product and subsequent 
emission. Industry standard speciﬁcations limit the 
concentration of HFC-23 allowed in the product to a small 
fraction of a percent. Consequently, removal with the 
product also accounts for only a very small portion of the 
HFC-23 that is generated.
• Vents from product storage. These are not signiﬁcant sources, 
even when plants capture HFC-23 (by condensation at high 
pressures and low temperatures) and subsequently store it 
as pure material. The storage tanks are enclosed vessels, 
not normally venting to atmosphere, and only a very small 
fraction of the plants producing HCFC-22 recover HFC-
23. This is clear from the small quantity of HFC-23 that is 
sold.

• The most important of the additional loss routes is in the 
aqueous phases from caustic and water scrubbers used 
in the process. These may yield useful product, such 
as hydrochloric acid (aqueous HCl), or be destined for 
waste treatment, but in any case volatile organics in such 
aqueous streams are readily emitted when the streams are 
subsequently managed in open systems, such as wastewater 
treatment processes. HFC-23 concentrations in the aqueous 
efﬂuent streams are only a few ppm at the most but the 
concentration in aqueous HCl can be several hundred ppm 
and this can represent an important release vector if the acid 
is used untreated. However, compared to the condenser vent, 
the aqueous HCl source is minor. Furthermore, the HFC-23 
can be removed from the aqueous HCl by air-stripping for 
subsequent treatment in the thermal oxidizer.
10.4.2 
Emission reduction options
Process optimization
In fully optimized processes, the likely range of emissions is 
about 1.5 to 3 percent of production, with 2 percent being a 
reasonable average estimate. Actual emissions depend on the 
age and design of the facility as well as the process manage-
ment techniques applied. However, it is not possible to elimi-
nate HFC-23 production completely by this means. 
Capture and destruction 
Further reductions in emissions beyond what is technically 
achievable through process optimization require additional 
equipment and, given that there is one main outlet for HFC-23 
from the process, the most favourable option for eliminating 
emissions is to collect and treat the vent gases. Thermal oxida-
tion is an effective treatment but the system must be designed 
to cope with, and render harmless, the halogen acids (HF and 
HCl) produced as a result of combustion. Depending on cost 
and availability, treatment can be on- or off-site. Emission tests 
at one plant showed that thermal oxidation destroys over 99.996 
percent of the HFC-23 (Irving and Branscombe, 2000), making 
this a highly effective treatment option. However, the impact of 
the down-time of thermal oxidation units on the emissions of 
HFC-23 needs to be considered (EFCTC, 2001).
 
In the EU, thermal destruction was available from mid-2000 
onwards, either on- or off-site, for six of the ten HCFC-22 man-
ufacturing facilities. These facilities make up approximately 
80% of EU HCFC-22 production but manufacturing plants in 
Spain (2), UK (1) and Greece (1) remain without such facili-
ties. The cost of a typical unit is �3 million (about US$4 mil-
lion) to destroy 200 metric tonnes of HFC-23 per year, plus 
�200,000 yr-1 (US$250,000) in operating costs (EFCTC, 2001; 
Harnisch and Hendriks, 2000). Assuming a technological life-
time of 15 years, it is possible to calculate that speciﬁc abate-
ment costs will be <0.2 US$/tCO2-eq. 
 
In 1995, European emissions amounted to 3,150 metric 
tonnes. The potential emission in the year 2000 could have been 
up to 7,340 tonnes per annum, depending upon the rate of for-
mation in the individual manufacturing plants, but these were 
reduced to actual emissions of less than 2,025 metric tonnes 
(EFCTC, 2001).
 
The US EPA estimates that US emissions of HFC-23 in 2002 
amounted to 1,690 metric tonnes of gas. Annual emissions have 
ﬂuctuated since 1990, before dropping by 45 percent/tonne of 
HCFC-22 produced in 2002 (US EPA, 2004b).
 
In Japan, the production of HCFC-22 was reported at 72,787 
metric tonnes for 2002, with the byproduction of 1,124 tonnes of 
HFC-23, of which 253 tonnes were destroyed. In 2003, 77,310 
tonnes of HCFC-22 were produced, with the byproduction of 
1,277 tonnes of HFC-23, 367 tonnes of which were destroyed 
(METI, 2004).
10.4.3 
Reduced emissions in the period prior to 2015 
given current best practice
It is apparent from historical trends, as described in Business-as-
usual emissions prior to 2015 above, that the amount of HFC-
23 co-produced with HCFC-22 in the developed world will be 
reduced by approximately half. There is at present no published 
information about current HFC-23 global emissions and, for the 
reduced emissions case, it is assumed that destruction technol-
ogy will be progressively introduced for all new and non-abated 
existing capacity from 2005 onwards. Destruction technology 
is assumed to be 100% efﬁcient and to operate for 90% of the 
on-line time of the HCFC-22 plant.
 
Reduced emissions were calculated for the same activity 
(in the form of assumed future HCFC-22 production) as in the 
business-as-usual case. The difference between the two HFC-23 
forecasts is therefore solely due to the extent of the deployment 
of destruction technology. The forecasts represent potential ex-
treme cases and future changes in activity will tend to increase 
the probability of one or the other. Table 10.10 lists values for 
the forecasts and the HCFC-22 production on which they are 
based.
 
Implications of HCFC-22 production phase-out
In view of the uncertainties of scenario generation, the busi-
ness-as-usual scenario uses consumption forecasts based on ad-
herence to the Montreal Protocol, with no further controls. This 
is a ﬁxed scenario (for the developed world) and amounts to a 
90% reduction in the production and consumption of HCFCs 
for non-feedstock uses there by 2015, although many countries 
already have, or are planning, more stringent regulations. In 
2010 in the US, the production and imports of HCFC-22 will be 
banned under the US Clean Air Act (US EPA, 1993), except for 
use in equipment manufactured before 2010. Within the EU, it 
is estimated that levels of HCFC-22 production for non-feed-
stock uses will decrease by 30% by the year 2010 under EU 
Regulation 2037/2000 on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
Layer (EFCTC, 2001). Such legislation is well documented 
and the current effect on production of HCFC-22 is recorded 
in the data reported by AFEAS (2003), which shows a fall of 
54,000 tonnes yr-1 by the year 2001 from the peak production

of 271,000 tonnes yr-1 that occurred in 1996. Potential disper-
sive consumption in the developed world is therefore already 
substantially below that in the business-as-usual scenario and 
will fall faster, skewing the probability of HFC-23 emissions 
towards the reduced emissions case.
 
Under the Montreal Protocol, the baseline year for develop-
ing countries is 2015, so that the regulatory maximum has yet to 
be established and production must be extrapolated from prior 
trends. In China, the production of HCFC-22 for dispersive use 
grew over the four years from 1998 to 2001 at a linear rate of 
18,100 tonnes yr-1 (R2 = 0.95), or 26% in the year 2000 (CCR, 
2002). When the other producers from developing countries 
and countries with economies in transition are included in the 
calculation, the growth rate reaches 20,000 tonnes yr-1 and this 
rate has been assumed for both business-as-usual and reduced 
emissions cases. Any changes made to the assumed production 
rates will have a direct effect on the forecast HFC-23 emis-
sions.
Use of HCFC-22 as feedstock
Historically, the demand for HCFC-22 in ﬂuoropolymers has 
been growing linearly in the developed world at a rate that ap-
proximated to 3% in the year 2000, or absolute growth rates of 
2200 tonnes yr-1 in the US, 1600 tonnes yr-1 in Japan and 2000 
tonnes yr-1 in the EU (Ceﬁc, 2003; SRI, 1998). In 2001 in China, 
the demand for HCFC-22 in the production of ﬂuoropolymers 
was 20,300 metric tonnes and the linear growth rate was 4100 
tonnes yr-1, with an R2 value of 0.99 over four years (CCR, 
2002). There is every reason to expect that this demand will 
continue to grow and there is no evidence for a future change 
in the growth rate. Hence, for both cases, demand for HCFC-22 
in ﬂuoropolymers was extrapolated using linear growth at these 
rates.  Any changes made to the assumed production rates will 
have a direct effect on the forecast HFC-23 emissions.
Alternative processes for HCFC-22 production
Although it is technically feasible to manufacture HCFC-22 in a 
reaction involving chloroform and HF in the vapour phase over 
a solid catalyst, most, if not all, modern processes use the liq-
uid-phase route described above (Hoechst, 1962). Furthermore, 
it is intrinsically more difﬁcult to control a vapour-phase pro-
cess for minimizing the formation of HFC-23 than to control a 
liquid-phase process. In the latter, conditions can be adjusted 
so that the boiling liquid in the reactor contains little HCFC-
22, therefore minimizing the possibilities of ﬂuorinating it to 
produce HFC-23. In the vapour phase, on the other hand, all 
HCFC-22 that is produced co-exists towards the exit of the cat-
alyst with the excess of HF. In a vapour-phase process it is not 
impossible to adjust conditions to minimize HFC-23; it is only 
more difﬁcult to do so than in the liquid phase.
Emission reduction potential
Table 10.10 shows the emissions under the mitigation scenario 
of this report, assuming implementation of current best prac-
tices. Destruction of byproduct emissions of HFC-23 from 
HCFC-22 production has a reduction potential of up to 300

Other miscellaneous uses 
A few additional niche applications of ODSs with possible HFC, 
PFC or other greenhouse-gas replacements were identiﬁed. 
ODS use at the time of the Montreal Protocol was very low and 
there is insufﬁcient literature available to evaluate the status of 
replacements, current or future emissions. It may also be the 
case that ODS use continues in some of these applications, 
especially where the source of the ODS is a common use such as 
a refrigerant and is redirected for convenience to an application 
such as cold cleaning or ﬂushing. The consumption of ODSs 
or replacements in these applications is generally assumed to 
be insigniﬁcant but documentation does not exist. Although not 
comprehensive, Table 10.11 lists applications identiﬁed through 
expert judgment.
 
At the time of the Montreal Protocol, CFCs, PFCs and 
SF6 were used simultaneously in a few applications, including 
wind tunnel tests, military dielectric applications, adiabatic 
applications, leak detection and tracer gases. Although there is 
little published information, consumption and emissions are not 
currently signiﬁcant and not expected to grow signiﬁcantly in 
the future. 
 
Finally, other signiﬁcant global sources of emissions of 
PFCs and SF6 were considered and found to be from processes 
that never used ODSs or for new applications that would not 
have used ODSs. This includes PFCs from primary aluminium 
production, and semiconductor manufacture, and SF6 used in 
high-voltage electrical equipment.

Chapter 11:  HFCs and PFCs: Current and Future Supply, Demand and Emissions, plus Emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and Halons 405
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
• Current production capacity for HFCs and PFCs exceeds 
current demand. There are a number of plants in devel-
oped countries and one plant in a developing country. The 
estimated production capacity for HFC-134a in 2002 was 
185,000 tonnes. No published data are available to forecast 
future production capacity. However, as there are no techni-
cal or legal limits to production, it can be assumed that pro-
duction will continue at a rate necessary to satisfy demand 
over time, although short-term ﬂuctuations are possible. 
Future production has therefore been estimated by aggre-
gating sectoral demand.
• Major drivers of demand for HFCs and PFCs include the 
Montreal Protocol and the expected worldwide increase in 
disposable income. HCFCs, HFCs and PFCs, together with 
not-in-kind alternatives, have contributed to the phase-out 
of CFCs and halons. The Multilateral Fund of the Montreal 
Protocol has been instrumental in introducing CFC replace-
ments in the markets of the developing countries. Nearly 
US$ 130 million has been disbursed to the developing coun-
tries for the conversion to HFCs, with another US$ 250 mil-
lion being disbursed for the conversion to HCFCs.
• Emissions of CFCs have fallen signiﬁcantly over the period 
1990–2000. HCFC emissions have grown signiﬁcantly dur-
ing this period. HFC emissions are also increasing. Demand 
for HCFCs, and hence emissions, are expected to continue 
to rise signiﬁcantly between 2000 and 2015, especially in 
developing countries. The fall in CFC emissions will not 
necessarily be accompanied by a directly proportional in-
crease in emissions of HCFCs and HFCs because of the 
switch to alternatives, improvements in design, contain-
ment, and improved recovery and disposal practices.
• Despite the fall in the production of CFCs, the existing 
bank of CFCs is over 1.1 million tonnes and is therefore a 
signiﬁcant source of potential future emissions. Banks of 
HCFCs and HFCs are being established as use increases. 
The management of CFC and HCFC banks is not controlled 
by the Montreal Protocol or taken into account under the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC).
• Byproduct emissions of HFC-23 are expected to rise glob-
ally by 60% during this period – especially in developing 
countries – but these emissions can be signiﬁcantly reduced 
with best-practice capture and the destruction of vent gas-
es.
• The estimates of aggregate emissions for the business-as-
usual scenario differ from other emission estimates (the 
IPCC (2000) SRES scenarios, for example), largely as a re-
sult of the more detailed analyses of the current applications 
that have been carried out for the purposes of this report. 
The SRES scenarios relied mainly on the application of re-
gional economic growth factors to the baseline consumption 
of individual compounds; furthermore, little distinction was 
made between annual consumption and annual emission.
• Total direct emissions amount to about 2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(2.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values), which is similar 
to the estimate derived in Chapter 2 from atmospheric mea-
surements. However, as shown in Table 11.6 and in Figure 
2.4, there are signiﬁcant differences between calculated and 
observed emissions of individual substances. For CFC-11, 
HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b in particular, the observations 
indicate signiﬁcantly higher emissions but the resolution of 
these systematic errors, while important and urgent, is out-
side the scope of this report. The errors affect the results 
quantitatively, but qualitative conclusions are sound.
• There are opportunities to reduce direct emissions signiﬁ-
cantly through the global application of best practices and 
recovery methods, with a reduction potential of about 1.2 
GtCO2-eq yr–1 of direct emissions by 2015, as compared to 
the business-as-usual scenario. The potential emission re-
ductions involve a broad range of costs: from net zero to 
US$300 per tonne of CO2 equivalent. These estimates are 
based on a mitigation scenario which assumes the global 
application of best practices for the use, recovery and de-
struction of these substances. About 60% of this potential 
is HFC emission reduction; HCFCs and CFCs contribute 
about 30% and 10% respectively.
• Recovery, recycling and reclamation, and the destruction 
of refrigerant not suitable for reprocessing, may reduce 
emissions by as much as 20%. Licensing and compliance 
programmes may have a signiﬁcant impact, with average 
leakage rates being achievable of less than 5% for stationary 
equipment and 12% for mobile systems. The costs for units 
used for recovery and recovery/recycling start at approxi-
mately US$500. Recovery, recycling and reuse costs may 
be offset by the savings in new refrigerant purchases. The 
destruction of contaminated and unwanted refrigerant can 
be achieved for less than US$3. 
• In some sectors, action to reduce indirect emissions (for 
example, through the improved energy efﬁciency of appli-
ances) will have a signiﬁcantly higher impact than focusing 
exclusively on the chemicals used.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
11.1 
Introduction
11.1.1 
Objectives
This chapter has three major objectives. The ﬁrst is to produce 
global estimates for current and future demand by aggregat-
ing “bottom-up” sectoral information, and to compare this 
with information about supply from known chemical produc-
tion facilities. The second is to compare the associated “bot-
tom-up” sectoral estimates of emissions with the “top-down” 
estimates derived from observations of atmospheric concentra-
tions of the selected chemical species presented in Chapter 2. 
The third objective is the identiﬁcation of the global extent of 
the opportunity for additional emission reductions through the 
implementation of additional sectoral measures beyond busi-
ness as usual. Data have been presented in both metric tonnes 
and also in CO2-equivalent-weighted tonnes. These data have 
been calculated using the global warming potentials that appear 
in Section 2.5 of this report and also the global warming poten-
tials in the IPCC 2nd and 3rd Assessment Reports (IPCC, 1996, 
2001). These SAR and TAR values are those used by parties 
to the UNFCCC for reporting inventory data and also adopted 
(Decision 1CP/5) in the Kyoto Protocol1. Use of these values 
facilitates a comparison against the regulatory commitments 
adopted within these agreements.
11.1.2 
Structure
Following a brief explanation of the methodology used, the 
chapter identiﬁes current and planned production facilities for 
the supply of HFCs, and compares this capacity with estimates 
of aggregate current demand and emissions (based on the sec-
toral information provided in Chapters 4 to 10). A comparison is 
then made between these “bottom-up” emission estimates and 
the “top-down” observed atmospheric concentrations presented 
in Chapter 2. The chapter then discusses the drivers of future 
demand and supply, and provides estimates of demand and 
emissions in 2015 under both a business-as-usual and a mitiga-
tion scenario. It concludes with a comparison of these estimates 
with those derived under previous scenarios, and the identiﬁca-
tion of the aggregate extent of the additional emission reduction 
opportunities that may be available through the implementation 
of additional measures. 
11.2 
Methodology for estimations
In estimating the supply of HFCs and PFCs, the basic assump-
tion is that supply will match demand. In addition, for current 
production, the aggregate supply of some individual substances 
can be veriﬁed using published capacity and production data. 
For projections, a check of this kind is not possible. Demand 
can exceed supply in some circumstances because chemical 
producers may be unwilling to invest in new plants due to un-
certainties resulting from the threat of government regulation. 
This, in turn, may result in tight supply, which will increase 
prices and may increase the use of alternatives. If this happens, 
actual use and emissions of HFCs and PFCs will be lower than 
projected in this chapter.
 
Two scenarios have been developed for demand (see Section 
11.5), the ﬁrst one based on business-as-usual assumptions (i.e. 
that all existing measures, including the Montreal Protocol, will 
continue and that no new measures will be introduced), and an-
other mitigation scenario based on an increased effort to achieve 
emission reductions through the global application of current 
best-practice emission reduction techniques (e.g. containment, 
recovery, recycling and destruction). The precise assumptions 
included in the mitigation scenario vary between chapters – and 
therefore these assumptions are discussed in detail in each of 
the chapters. Because the Kyoto Protocol does not impose spe-
ciﬁc emission limitations on a substance-by-substance basis, 
the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol does not directly alter 
either of the scenarios. However, national measures related to 
ﬂuorocarbons have been included where they have been intro-
duced or announced.
 
Wherever possible, the “bottom-up” methodology has been 
used to develop demand and emission estimates; the “top-
down” approach often has to rely on a limited number of data 
points since the substances concerned are often in their early 
stage of market introduction (see also section 11.4).

for HFCs and PFCs, plus emissions for CFCs, 
HCFCs and halons 
11.3.1 
Current and planned global supply of HFCs and 
PFCs – production and number of facilities
From a number of data sources, including UNFCCC, AFEAS 
and the World Bank, it is possible to make estimates of the 
global capacities for the production of HFC-134a in different 
1 These GWPs for HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are the values adopted for the Kyoto 
Protocol pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 5 of Decision 1/CP.3 (FCCC/
CP/1997/7/Add.1). “3. The global warming potentials used to calculate the 
carbon dioxide equivalence of anthropogenic emissions by sources and re-
movals by sinks of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A shall be those accepted 
by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and agreed upon by the 
Conference of the Parties at its third session. Based on the work of, inter alia, 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and advice provided by the 
Subsidiary Body on Scientiﬁc and Technological Advice, the Conference of 
the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Protocol shall regu-
larly review and, as appropriate, revise the global warming potential of each 
such greenhouse gas, taking fully into account any relevant decisions by the 
Conference of the Parties. Any revision to a global warming potential shall 
apply only to commitments under Article 3 in respect of any commitment pe-
riod adopted subsequent to that revision.” and Paragraph 3 of Decision 2/CP.3 
(FCCC/CP/1997/7/Add.1): “3. Reafﬁrms that global warming potentials used 
by Parties should be those provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change in its Second Assessment Report (“1995 IPCC GWP values”) based on 
the effects of the greenhouse gases over a 100-year time horizon, taking into 
account the inherent and complicated uncertainties involved in global warming 
potential estimates. In addition, for information purposes only Parties may also 
use another time horizon, as provided in the Second Assessment Report.”

Chapter 11:  HFCs and PFCs: Current and Future Supply, Demand and Emissions, plus Emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and Halons 407
regions, and the companies and the number of production fa-
cilities that produce the other main HFCs (see Table 11.1 and 
Figure 11.1). A complicating factor is that, apart from HFC-
134a, -125 and -143a, the other individual HFCs are produced 
by three producers or less. Consequently, the actual production 
volumes are not publicly available for those substances under 
anti-trust rules. Moreover, AFEAS data do not cover all produc-
ing companies, but only those established in Japan, the EU and 
the USA. Facilities in China, Korea and the Russian Federation, 
for example, are not covered under AFEAS.
 
At present, global capacity just exceeds aggregate demand, 
since ﬂuorocarbon producers have made investments in antici-
pation of the likely future needs for, among other substances, 
HFCs and PFCs triggered by phase-out under the Montreal 
Protocol.
 
There is no available information about supply that enables 
a forecast of future production capacities for different HFCs or 
PFCs. However, as there are no technical or legal limits to the 
production of these chemicals, it has been assumed that pro-
duction will continue to occur at the rate necessary to satisfy 
demand, and it has been assumed that construction lead time 
on the year-to-year availability of product and the perception 
of potential legislative controls on investors’ conﬁdence have 
no effects. Future production has been estimated by the simple 
aggregation of sectoral demand projections.

11.3.2 
Current demand for HFCs and PFCs 
Sectoral demand: past trends and current situation in devel-
oped and developing countries 
When the Montreal Protocol was signed in 1987, alternatives 
to CFCs and halons were not commercially available for most 
applications. By 1989, the ﬁrst reports of the UNEP Technology 
Assessment Panels of the Montreal Protocol (UNEP-TEAP, 
1989, Chapter 3.10) concluded that, while non-ﬂuorocarbon 
alternatives including not-in-kind alternatives would be impor-
tant, HCFCs and HFCs would be necessary in order to make 
substantial and timely reductions in CFC and halon consump-
tion. In 1990 the Montreal Protocol was amended to require a 
phase-out of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-tri-
chloroethane. 
 
Technical advances subsequently accelerated the com-
mercial availability and use of the new alternatives, including 
not-in-kind technologies. Consistent with these advances, the 
Montreal Protocol was further amended in 1992 to require a 
phase-out of HCFCs. By 1998, the TEAP reports were noting a 
rapid development of technologies that were no longer reliant 
on ﬂuorocarbons (UNEP-TEAP, 1998).
 
Table 11.2 shows the aggregated demand for CFCs, HCFCs 
and halons, as well as HFCs and PFCs. The data are derived 
primarily from Ashford et al. (2004) and supplemented by data 
from Chapters 4 – 10 in this report, UNEP (2004b) and AFEAS 
(2004). These data serve as the baseline for the projections of 
2015 demand and emissions in both the business-as-usual and 
mitigation scenarios.
 
In the absence of the Montreal Protocol, the use of CFCs 
would have increased signiﬁcantly (Prather et al., 1996). 
However, as a result of its adoption, the use and production of 
CFCs and halons have almost completely ceased in developed 
countries (UNEP, 2004b), and are rapidly falling in developing 
countries, as demanded by the schedule in the protocol. The 
use of HFCs has facilitated this rapid phase-out in developed 
countries, particularly (but not solely) in applications where 
other alternatives were not available. In many cases, HFCs are 
still important for the safe and cost-effective phase-out of CFCs 
and halons in countries with economies in transition and in de-
veloping countries (UNEP-TEAP, 2004). Developed countries 
have replaced about 8% of projected CFC use with HFCs and 
12% with HCFCs. They have eliminated the remaining 80% 
by controlling emissions, making speciﬁc use reductions, or by 
using alternative technologies and non-HCFC and HFC ﬂuids, 
including ammonia, carbon dioxide, water and not-in-kind op-
tions. Approximately 20% of halon use has been replaced by 
HFCs, less than 1% by PFCs and 50% by non-gaseous agents 
(UNEP-TEAP, 1999b). Some of the options are shown in Table 
11.3.
11.3.3 
Current emissions of CFCs, halons, HCFCs, 
HFCs, and PFCs
Emissions occur during both the production and use of these 
substances. During production, the emissions are largely inad-
vertent, whereas emissions arising from use of the substances 
can be either intentional or inadvertent.
11.3.3.1 Production emissions
Emissions of HFCs and PFCs occur during the production of 
ﬂuorocarbons, either as undesired byproducts or as losses of 
useful material, for example during the ﬁlling of containers or 
when production equipment is opened for maintenance. In gen-
eral, the emissions during production are much smaller than the 
emissions during the use of the products. Nevertheless, tech-
niques and procedures to minimize emissions have been de-
veloped, including the thermal oxidation of gas streams before 
they are released into the atmosphere. Calculating emissions 
from such sources requires data about not only the quantities 
of materials produced (the activity) and the rate of emission 
(which is inﬂuenced by the process design and operating cul-
ture) but also about the extent to which emissions are abated. 
This is particularly important in determining the uncertainty of 
Table 11.3. Replacement of CFCs and halons in developed countries (derived from UNEP-TEAP, 2000).

estimates of future emissions. The majority of these estimates 
are made using standardized tables for emissions that cover 
valves, joints, pumps and other processing parts.
Byproduct emissions of HFC-23
The most signiﬁcant of the byproducts is HFC-23 (ﬂuoroform). 
It is produced during the manufacture of HCFC-22. Global 
emissions of HFC-23 increased by an estimated 12% between 
1990 and 1995, due to a similar increase in the global produc-
tion of HCFC-22 (see Table 10.10 in Chapter 10, and the de-
scription of chemical routes of manufacture in Appendix 11A).
 
The quantity of HFC-23 that is produced (and that, po-
tentially, may be emitted) is directly related to the production 
of HCFC-22 and so emission forecasts require a scenario for 
future HCFC-22 production volumes. These will depend on 
the consumption of HCFC-22 in developed countries, which 
is declining, and the consumption in developing countries and 
global demand for ﬂuoropolymers feedstock, both of which 
are increasing (see Section 10.4). After thorough investigation, 
the US EPA concluded that process optimization reduces, but 
does not eliminate, HFC-23 emissions. To reduce the emissions 
below the 1% level, thermal oxidation is required (Irving and 
Branscombe, 2002).
 
On the basis of a business-as-usual scenario that assumes 
that consumption of ozone-depleting substances will match the 
maximum levels permitted under the Montreal Protocol, the 
consumption and production of non-feedstock HCFC-22 will 
fall by a factor of almost 10 by 2015 from the average level in 
2000-2003 in developed countries (including the 15% produc-
tion allowance to meet the basic domestic needs of developing 
countries). In developed countries, demand for ﬂuoropolymer 
feedstock is projected to continue increasing linearly, lead-
ing to a doubling in feedstock demand for HCFC-22 in those 
countries by 2015 (see Section 10.4). In developing countries, 
production of HCFC-22 for both feedstock and non-feedstock 
uses has grown rapidly in recent years; over the period 1997 
to 2001, production for potentially emissive (or non-feedstock) 
uses grew linearly at 20,000 tonnes yr–1 and feedstock use grew 
at 4,100 tonnes yr–1 (see Chapter 10) Assuming that these rates 
continue until 2015, the total global requirement for HCFC-22 
will be about 707,000 tonnes yr–1, about 40% of which would 
be for feedstock, compared to a total of 490,000 tonnes yr–1 in 
the year 2000 (Table 10.10).
 
In the business-as-usual case prior to 2015, it has been as-
sumed that emissions from existing capacity will continue at 
2% of HCFC-22 production (reﬂecting the average of plants 
in developed and developing countries, including current lev-
els of abatement) and that new capacity (mainly in developing 
countries) will emit HFC-23 at a rate of 4% (see Chapter 10). 
Consequently, emissions of HFC-23 could grow by 60% be-
tween now and 2015, from about 15,000 tonnes yr–1 in 2003 to 
23,000 tonnes yr–1 (Table 10.10).
 
In the variant for this scenario, the current best-practice 
technology, which includes the capture and thermal oxidation 
of the “vent gases”, is introduced into all facilities progressively 
from 2005 onwards. Destruction technology is assumed to be 
100% efﬁcient and to operate for 90% of the on-line time of 
HCFC-22 plants. Reduced emissions were calculated for the 
same activity (in the form of assumed future HCFC-22 produc-
tion) as the business-as-usual case. The difference between the 
two HFC-23 forecasts is therefore solely due to the extent of the 
deployment of destruction technology. The forecasts represent 
potential extreme cases, and future changes in activity will tend 
to increase the probability of one or the other. 
 
The reduction of HCFC-22 production due to market forces 
or national policies, or improvements in facility design and con-
struction to reduce HFC-23 output, could further inﬂuence these 
scenarios. An additional factor is the possible implementation 
of Clean Development Mechanism projects to install destruc-
tion facilities in non-annex I countries. This could result in a 
more rapid reduction of HFC-23 emissions than would other-
wise have occurred.
11.3.3.2 Emissions arising from use
As noted under 11.3.2, the production and use of CFCs and 
halons have almost completely ceased in developed countries, 
and are rapidly falling in developing countries (Ashford et al., 
2004). HFCs and HCFCs have replaced about 8% and 12% of 
projected CFC use respectively in developed countries (UNEP-
TEAP, 1999b). Similarly, about 20 % of halon use has been 
replaced by HFCs and less than 1% by PFCs (UNEP-TEAP, 
1999b). The resulting changes in historic emissions of CFCs 
and HCFCs are shown in Table 11.4 (Ashford et al., 2004). 
 
Despite an equivalent fall in production of CFCs, the bank 
of material that remains in equipment and has not yet been emit-
ted remains signiﬁcant. For example, in the year 2002, the CFC 
bank amounted to over 2.4 million tonnes, consisting mainly 
of CFC-11 in foams (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab). In addition to the 
emissions of CFCs and HCFCs from future consumption in de-
veloping countries, it is expected that a substantial proportion 
of these banks will eventually be released into the atmosphere 
under a business-as-usual scenario. There are opportunities

to make signiﬁcant reductions in these emissions through the 
global application of best-practice handling and eventual de-
struction of these gases (UNEP-TEAP, 2002ab).
 
Tables 11.5a and 11.5b show the development of banks of 
some ﬂuorocarbons. 
 
Refrigeration, air conditioning (particularly air conditioning 
in vehicles) and heat pumps are the largest source of emissions 
of HFCs. In the future, improved design, tighter components, 
and recovery and recycling during servicing and disposal could 
reduce HFC emissions at moderate to low costs (see Chapter 
6). The impact of improved practices will vary between regions 
and countries.
 
Insulating foams are expected to become the second-largest 
source of HFC emissions, and HFC use is expected to grow rap-
idly as CFCs and HCFCs are replaced with HFC-134a, HFC-
227ea, HFC-245fa and HFC-365mfc (see Chapter 7). In replac-
ing CFC-11 use in insulating foams in the refrigeration sector, 
around 66% of the ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) were 
replaced by hydrocarbons in investment projects approved by 
the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol. In non-refrig-
eration uses, 30% of the ODSs were replaced by hydrocarbons, 
25% by HCFCs and 45% by zero-ODP/zero-GWP alternatives 
(UNEP-TEAP, 1999b, Chapter 24).
 
Other sources of HFC emissions are industrial-solvent ap-
plications, medical aerosol products, other aerosol products, ﬁre 
protection and non-insulating foams. Increased containment, 
recovery, destruction and substitution can reduce emissions. In 
some applications in all these sectors, there are zero- or low-
GWP options. 
 
Limited data are available about PFC emissions and use.

These substances are predominantly used in ﬁre protection and 
in solvent applications. In the case of ﬁre protection, use is 
emissive but products remain in the equipment until use once it 
has been installed and the options for reducing these emissions 
are therefore limited (see Chapter 9). PFC solvents are no lon-
ger considered technically necessary for most applications and 
use has decreased since the mid-1990s due to replacement with 
lower-GWP solvents (see Chapter 10).
11.3.4 
Comparison of emissions estimated via a bottom-
up approach with those calculated from observed 
atmospheric concentrations of CFCs, HCFCs and 
HFCs 
As noted in Chapter 2, one approach to evaluating the total 
global emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases uses observa-
tions of their atmospheric concentrations. By contrast, Table 
11.6 presents the breakdown of direct emissions of each halo-
carbon for the year 2002, as derived via the bottom-up approach 
described in Chapters 4 to 10. Total direct emissions amount to

about 2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (2.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR 
values), which is similar to the estimate derived in Chapter 2 
from atmospheric measurements. However, as shown in Table 
11.6 and in Figure 2.4, there are signiﬁcant differences for indi-
vidual substances between calculated and observed emissions, 
notably for CFC-11, HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b. The pos-
sible reasons for such differences are examined in Appendix 
11B, together with suggestions for further work in this area that 
could clarify the sources. The lack of information on use pat-
terns for these substances makes it difﬁcult to assess the contri-
bution to observed emissions from current production and use.
 
The differences between emissions estimates constitute a 
long-standing problem that has yet to be resolved by the re-
search community. Nevertheless, qualitative conclusions can 
be drawn for all gases and for some gases, notably the HFCs, 
atmospheric concentrations match emissions estimates and 
quantitative conclusions are justiﬁed. Current CFC emissions 
are dominated by delayed releases from banks (such as mate-
rial contained in existing foams, air conditioning, refrigeration, 
and other applications). Calculating the magnitude of these 
emissions is therefore a complicated process requiring massive 
amounts of data and there is signiﬁcant scope for systematic er-
ror. Observations of the changes in concentrations of CFCs can 
provide direct insights into their emissions. The observed rates 
of change differ among CFCs, depending mainly upon the gas 
lifetimes and emissions (see Chapter 2). The concentrations of 
some CFCs have peaked and a slow decline is now being ob-
served, while others are expected to decline in the future. CFC-
11 concentrations are decreasing about 60% slower than they 
would in the absence of emissions, while CFC-12 has only now 
stabilized. These changes show that CFC-12 emissions, largely 
from the banks, remain similar in magnitude to the quantities of 
these gases that are naturally destroyed in the atmosphere. 
 
Table 11.7 shows the historical emissions arising from the 
use of HFCs, as derived from production and sales data, and sec-
tor-speciﬁc emission factors. For HFC-134a, these concur well 
with measured atmospheric concentrations where known. For 
example, Figure 11.2 compares concentrations of HFC-134a 
measured at Mace Head, Ireland with northern hemispherical 
concentrations calculated from the emission data.
 
The good historic match for HFC-134a is found for emis-
sions calculated using both top-down methodology (as in Table 
11.7) and bottom-up methods (that rely on sector-speciﬁc ac-
tivities and emission functions). 
 
The EDGAR database contains other historical data for 1990 
and 1995 (http://arch.rivm.nl/env/int/coredata/edgar/). This da-
tabase relies on calculations described in Olivier (2002) and 
Olivier and Berdowski (2001). Although the values quoted for 
emissions of HFC-134a and HFC-23 agree with the data used 
in this chapter, those for HFC-125, -143a, -152a and -227ea 
are markedly different. The lack of exact information about 
production volumes (see 11.3.1) introduces major uncertainties 
with regard to top-down estimates of the future emissions based 
on those data.
11.4 
Discussion of demand drivers, including 
differentiation between developed and developing 
countries 
11.4.1 
Demand drivers for HFCs and PFCs 
By far the most important factor in the demand for HFCs and 
to a lesser extent PFCs has been the adoption of the Montreal 
Protocol and the subsequent amendments to it. Moreover, a 
number of developed countries have accelerated the phase-out 
of ozone-depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, 
thus providing extra impetus for demand. These substitution ef-
fects have been discussed extensively in the previous chapters. 
 
Perhaps the single most important demand factor after the

Chapter 11:  HFCs and PFCs: Current and Future Supply, Demand and Emissions, plus Emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and Halons 415
implementation of the Montreal Protocol is the expected in-
crease in disposable income in the developing world and the 
acquisition by families of more than one appliance of the same 
kind, as noted in various chapters above. In the next decade, 
hundreds of millions of families can be expected to pass the 
wealth threshold enabling them to purchase products that may 
contain or be manufactured with HFCs or PFCs. As noted in 
SRES, world population growth and GDP growth are also ma-
jor factors in future global demand for HFCs and PFCs.
 
Other factors that are expected to have a positive impact on 
demand for HFCs and PFCs are:
• energy efﬁciency requirements which may in some cases 
encourage the use of ﬂuids with superior thermodynamic 
properties or insulation values;
• safety requirements (including standards) which exclude 
the use of ﬂammable or toxic substances or ﬂuids with very 
high operating pressures;
• other environmental legislation, e.g. VOC rules that set a 
ceiling on emissions, or that prohibit their use in particular 
applications;
• especially in the USA, product liability concerns encourage 
the use of HFCs rather than ﬂammable or toxic substances;
• in the mobile air-conditioning sector, the primary replace-
ment for CFC-12 is HFC-134a. There has been a steep rise 
in the use of these systems in Europe and developing coun-
tries in recent years and this is predicted to continue;
• ﬁnancial mechanisms that enable the compliance of devel-
oping countries and of countries with economies in transi-
tion under the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol 
and the Global Environment Facility respectively have had 
a positive impact on demand for HFCs, but this impact may 
decline in the future. A number of the projects that were sup-
ported by these mechanisms converted CFCs to HCFCs and 
HFCs.
Other developments may reduce demand:
• in the context of their commitments under the Kyoto 
Protocol, some countries have adopted legislation restrict-
ing the use of ﬂuorinated greenhouse gases in some applica-
tions;
• the establishment of a recovery, recycling, reclamation and 
destruction infrastructure for ozone-depleting substances 
will prove useful for HFCs and PFCs as well, thus reducing 
demand for virgin material;
• because of their complex chemistry, HFCs and PFCs tend 
to be an order of magnitude more expensive than ozone-de-
pleting substances, thus further encouraging recovery/reuse 
and the switch to not-in-kind technology;
• intellectual property rights for particular uses may equally 
encourage the switch to not-in-kind technology;
• other countries tax these gases according to their global 
warming potential and/or require their recovery when equip-
ment is serviced or disposed;
• awareness among the governments and public in general 
of the linkages between ozone layer protection and climate 
change and impacts of HFCs/PFCs on the climate system 
Box 11.1 The Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol
The Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol funded projects totalling approximately US$ 130 million that have contrib-
uted to the replacement of nearly 13,000 tonnes per year of CFCs by HFC-134a in developing countries (10,000 tonnes of 
conversion under these projects has  already been completed). This represents approximately 30% of the CFCs phased out 
in the refrigeration sector under the Multilateral Fund. Most (99%) of the replacement by HFCs is in the refrigeration sec-
tor, in other words chillers, commercial refrigeration, compressors, domestic refrigeration and mobile air-conditioning. The 
remaining introduction of HFCs was in the solvents, aerosols and foam sectors. The introduction of HFC-152a and R-404A 
as replacements for CFCs in developing countries has been minimal. 
The Multilateral Fund has also supported projects in developing countries totalling nearly US$ 250 million for the replace-
ment of approximately 32,000 tonnes per year of CFCs by HCFCs (20,000 tonnes of conversion under these projects has 
already been completed). Eighty-ﬁve percent of this replacement has involved HCFC-141b (majority of which in the foam 
sector) and the remainder HCFC-22 in the refrigeration sector.
The Multilateral Fund has provided incremental costs for the shut-down of CFC production facilities in developing coun-
tries. The ﬂexibility provided has enabled China, for example, to use part of the funds to establish the small-scale production 
of HFC-134a.
There is no inventory system for GEF-funded projects in CEITs that enables a clear determination of the overall share of 
ODS replacement by HCFCs and HFCs.

as a result of the decisions in the Conference of the Parties 
(Climate Convention)/ Meeting of the Parties.
The impact of technology is more uncertain. During the phase-
out of ozone-depleting substances, many industries had signiﬁ-
cant technical hurdles to overcome, as described in previous 
chapters. This has led, in many cases, to the introduction of 
new technology and has signiﬁcantly reduced equipment leak-
age rates through improved containment. Furthermore, energy 
efﬁciency has improved in many cases. Consequently, energy 
use and associated indirect emissions have grown less than they 
would have otherwise. 
11.4.2 
Discussion of drivers of supply for HFCs and 
PFCs 
Drivers that will inﬂuence the business-as-usual scenario for the 
supply of HFCs and PFCs include the impact of current and an-
ticipated policies and measures (including impact on demand), 
mitigation options, the economics of manufacturing HFCs and 
PFCs (both direct and indirect), technological change, sup-
ply capacity, and the timing and nature of the transition from 
ozone-depleting substances.
 
As indicated above, the basic assumption is that supply will 
follow demand. Individual manufacturers will make their own 
assessment of the market potential (=demand) and take invest-
ment decisions accordingly. In doing so, several considerations 
will be taken into account:
• the manufacture of HFCs and PFCs is increasingly complex 
and often surrounded by measures for protecting intellectual 
property;
• using existing infrastructures (HCFC plants, for example) 
will reduce the required capital expenditure and construc-
tion time;
• economies of scale are more important for HFCs because of 
the large capital investment required for these plants due to 
their complexity (see appendix 1A);
• the reluctance of downstream users to be dependent on a 
single source of supply;
• access to, and the availability of, key raw materials are gain-
ing importance;
• new recovery and reclamation requirements will result to 
some extent (albeit an uncertain extent) in a switch away 
from newly produced substances;
• uncertainties relating to future policies and measures for 
greenhouse gases will add a risk premium to the minimum 
acceptable rate of return;
• the disposal of carbon tetrachloride co-generated from chlo-
romethane plants may drive some producers in developing 
countries to use this product to start the manufacture of 
HFC-245fa and HFC-365mfc;
• producers of HFCs/PFCs may not make investment deci-
sions due to uncertainties about the future of HFCs/PFCs 
arising out of the assessments and also due to impending 
regulations at the national, regional and global levels. 
As a result, investments are likely to be made in existing sites 
and the number of production sites can be expected to remain 
limited. Greenﬁeld investment will most likely occur in regions 
with substantial market potential, particularly China. Equally, 
supply can be expected to follow demand more closely than has 
been the case for CFCs and HCFCs. The perceived regulatory 
risks, and the existence of valid process patents, may discour-
age the conversion of current production facilities for ozone-
depleting substances in developing countries to HFC and PFC 
production (with the latter being less likely). Furthermore, due 
to the complexity of the processes, most production facilities 
for ozone-depleting substances are not easily convertible to 
HFC production.
 
With CFCs phased out in developed countries, the produc-
tion of HFCs and PFCs for supply is now focused upon main-
taining the existing market, satisfying market growth, exports to 
other markets and developing capacity to cater for the demand 
for replacing HCFCs. Rapidly expanding markets in develop-
ing countries, in particular for CFC replacements, are resulting 
in new capacity for ﬂuorinated gases, currently through the ex-
pansion of HCFC-22 and -141b capacity. Much of this is being 
achieved through local production in developing countries and 
joint ventures.
11.4.3 
Impact of recovery, recycling and reclamation of 
CFCs, HCFCs, halons and HFCs 
11.4.3.1 Current situation
Emissions may be reduced by cutting back on demand and de-
stroying refrigerant at end of life. Demand may be reduced by 
the reuse of refrigerant affected by recovery programmes, and 
the prevention of leakage and losses through improved work 
practices and higher standards. These measures may be volun-
tary or mandatory and experience indicates that a co-regulatory 
approach, and cooperation between industry and governments 
resulting in mutually agreed regulation, provide a genuine and 
sustainable reduction in emissions.
 
Recovery, recycling and reclamation take place on a number 
of levels in developed countries. In many developed countries 
and regions – Australia, the European Union, United States and 
Japan for example – there are regulatory requirements that man-
date the removal of “used” ﬂuorinated gases from equipment 
during dismantling and destruction, and/or regulations that 
prohibit the venting of ﬂuorinated gases. These requirements 
have been extended, or are in the process of being extended, to 
include HFCs and PFCs (Snelson and Bouma, 2003). In cer-
tain regions, the regulatory requirements are supported by in-
dustry voluntary schemes. In developing countries, UNEP has 
launched initiatives to encourage the recovery and recycling of 
CFCs and HCFCs although, at present, these have not been ex-
tended to HFCs and PFCs (ÙNEP, 2003).
 
Product stewardship schemes have been established by in-
dustry and governments in numerous countries to take back, and 
either reclaim or destroy, recovered refrigerant. These schemes 
may provide incentives for technicians to recover and return

refrigerant, although the potential to charge for the service ex-
ists.
 
Current recovery and reuse practices include: service com-
panies and technicians recovering and reinstalling used ﬂuori-
nated refrigerants; major users (supermarkets, buildings etc.) 
recovering and reinstalling ﬂuorinated gases in their own plant; 
large distributors of ﬂuorinated gases collecting and either re-
cycling or reclaiming ﬂuorinated gases for resale; and produc-
ers of the ﬂuorinated gases recovering and reusing refrigerants, 
sometimes as feedstock. In the EU, where used refrigerants 
are classed as “hazardous waste”, transportation is a costly bu-
reaucratic process that acts as a disincentive, particularly when 
the used refrigerants must be moved across national borders. 
In the EU, it is mandatory to destroy recovered CFCs under 
Regulation 2037/2000.
 
Similar recovery, recycling and reclamation processes take 
place in the ﬁre-ﬁghting industry. For the foam industry, the 
recovery of the foam products during the dismantling of foam-
containing equipment and buildings is possible and, in some 
developed countries, mandatory. Fluorinated gases that are re-
covered will primarily be sent for destruction, as the presence of 
contaminants makes recycling and reuse non-economic. In the 
case of solvent use, recycling is an integral part of the process 
in which they are used: the solvents are boiled constantly in the 
equipment in which they are used and the vapour is condensed 
and reused. Solvents are also recovered from equipment and re-
cycled externally from that equipment; this work is mainly done 
by the user of the solvent. Once the solvent reaches a level of 
contamination where recycling is not possible, it is destroyed. 
During the manufacture of metered dose inhalers, ﬂuorinated 
gases are captured during the ﬁlling process and recycled in 
the ﬁlling equipment, thereby reducing emissions. Recycling 
of ﬂuorinated gases externally is not often seen as an option 
because of contamination with pharmaceutical residues.
 
As a result of the majority of recovery, recycling and recla-
mation being carried out either on the premises of the user of 
the ﬂuorinated gases or by independent distributors of the gas-
es, there is only limited information on which to base estimates 
of the quantities of gases recovered, recycled or reclaimed. 
The cost of the gases is a major driver for recovery, recycling 
and reclamation, and some countries – notably Australia, the 
Netherlands and Norway – have a system that encourages the 
return of gases through a payment (or equivalent compensation) 
based upon quantity and quality.
11.4.3.2 Future opportunities
Recovery and reuse or destruction are important components of 
emission reduction. Whilst it is difﬁcult to assess the volume of 
refrigerant that may be recovered, there has been some quan-
tiﬁcation work. A survey undertaken by Refrigerant Reclaim 
Australia (RRA) (Bennett, 2001) suggests that the equivalent 
of 25% of refrigerant sales may be recovered in any given year. 
The amount of recovered refrigerant recycled, reclaimed or de-
stroyed translates directly to an equivalent reduction in demand 
and emissions. The survey indicated that the equivalent of 20% 
of sales may be recovered from service and maintenance appli-
cations, and that the equivalent of 5% of sales may be recovered 
from decommissioned plants.
 
The RRA study, which included two hundred direct inter-
views with service companies, sought to establish a picture of 
the applications for new refrigerant ﬁrst in order to ascertain 
the potential for recovery. Figure 11.3 shows the uses for new 
refrigerant.
 
The quantiﬁcation project used the methodology outlined in 
Figure 11.3. Essentially, this process tracks imported product 
through the sales and application chain to determine the amount 
of product that may be returned. A number of the data points in 
the graphic were determined through research and survey work. 
The balance of required information was collected through sur-
veys of contractors.
 
Figure 11.4 displays the applications using purchased new 
refrigerants. These results refer only to refrigerant sold to con-
tractors and not refrigerant purchased by original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs).
 
The results from the survey indicate that only about 20% 
of new refrigerant applications, retroﬁtting and contaminations 
lead to the controlled recovery of existing refrigerant.
 
The other application from which installed refrigerant 
is recovered is the decommissioning of existing aged plants. 
Industry experience indicates that approximately 5% of sales of 
new refrigerant are recovered annually from decommissioned 
plants. This ﬁgure does not include domestic refrigeration and 
air conditioning, as coordinated recovery and recycling pro-
grammes for electrical goods have not commenced in Australia 
as yet.
 
The second section of the survey looked at the processes 
contractors and technicians applied to the refrigerant they re-
covered. The responses can be found in Figure 11.5.

The results are as follows:
• Reuse/Store: Approximately 63% of all refrigerant recov-
ered was recycled and reused or stored by contractors for 
later use. This is an encouraging result, as recycling was 
not an activity undertaken by the industry in Australia only 
some years before. This activity impacts directly on emis-
sion levels by reducing the volume of refrigerant being im-
ported.
• Emit/Sell: A very small percentage of contractors admitted 
to contravening the law by emitting refrigerant or selling 
impure recovered refrigerant.
• Returned: Contractors indicated that approximately 35% of 
all refrigerant recovered was returned to RRA for safe dis-
posal.
The key results are ﬁrstly that a volume equivalent to 25% of 
sales of new refrigerant may be recovered in any year, and sec-
ondly that approximately 35% of the amount recovered – about 
9% – may be expected to be returned for destruction.
Impact of ﬁnancial incentives on recovered volumes
The impact of ﬁnancial incentives on the volume of refrigerant 
recovered and returned may be signiﬁcant. In early 2003, RRA 
doubled the ﬁnancial incentive paid to service companies for 
returned refrigerant. This measure, in conjunction with promo-
tional and information programmes highlighting the environ-
mental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts of recovery, produced an increase 
of more than 50% of refrigerant returned to RRA (RRA Annual 
Report, 2004), see Figure 11.6.
Other ﬁnancial incentives
Some countries tax imports and/or sales of HFC and PFCs, 
thereby increasing their price and encouraging reuse. Norway 
and Denmark use taxation based on the global warming poten-
tial of the refrigerant (Chapter 4), and then provide a rebate for

the return of recovered refrigerant. In the Netherlands, a sub-
sidy of 50% on the cost of collection and destruction of halons 
and CFCs was provided to discourage venting.
 
Whilst there are no comparative studies of programmes 
available, logic and general behaviour would suggest that pro-
grammes that provide ﬁnancial incentives, such as payments 
for return, will perform better compared to those that charge for 
the return of recovered refrigerant.
Funding of recovery programmes
There are numerous methods for funding refrigerant recovery 
programmes (Snelson and Bouma, 2003). In general, the ul-
timate user of the refrigerant, the equipment owner, will bear 
the cost in accordance with the polluter-pays principle. Where 
there is government funding (USA) and joint government and 
industry funding (Japan), the most common method of fund-
ing is the application of an industry-wide levy on sales of new 
refrigerant.
 
A good example is Australia, where a levy of Australian 
$1.00 (0.78 US$) per kilogramme was applied in 1993 (Bennett, 
2001). The collected funds are held in a special purpose trust. 
Initially, the levy applied only to ozone-depleting refrigerants 
but it was extended in 2004 to “synthetic greenhouse gas” refrig-
erants to fund the expansion of the recovery programme to take 
back those products. Anti-trust issues were managed through 
application to, and approval from, the Australian Competition 
Commission. An industry-wide levy has numerous advantages, 
including cost sharing as a result of the contribution from all of 
industry, guaranteed revenue over the long term, and the ﬂex-
ibility to allow for increased recovery and subsequent costs.
Licensing, accreditation and standards
Improvements in technical standards and their conscientious 
application will result in signiﬁcant reductions in direct and 
indirect emissions. The application of technical standards can 
be effectively achieved within a licensing or accreditation pro-
gramme. The beneﬁts of such programmes are: improved stan-
dards of workmanship; more efﬁcient installations; lower leak-
age rates; improved and more regular maintenance practices; 
and increased rates of recovery, recycling, reuse and safe dis-
posal. It should be noted that a common element of successful 
licensing schemes is a robust compliance programme. 
 
The two best-known programmes of this type are the KMO 
programme in Denmark, and the STEK programme in the 
Netherlands. In the Netherlands, emissions have been signiﬁ-
cantly reduced through national mandatory regulations estab-
lished in 1992 for CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs, assisted by an in-
dustry-supported certiﬁcation model. STEK is the abbreviation 
for the institution that certiﬁes practices for installation compa-
nies in the refrigeration business. Elements of the regulation are 
detailed by Van Gerwen and Verwoerd (1998). They include, 
among other requirements, technical requirements to improve 
tightness, system commissioning to include pressure and leak-
age tests, refrigerant record keeping, periodic system inspec-
tions for leak tightness, maintenance and installation work by 
certiﬁed companies and servicing personnel.
 
The success of the Dutch regulations and the STEK organi-
zation in reducing refrigerant emissions was demonstrated with 
results from a detailed study in 1999 of emission data from 
the refrigeration and air-conditioning sectors. For commercial 
refrigeration, annual refrigerant emissions (emissions during 
leakage plus disposal) were 3.2% of the total bank of refriger-
ant contained in this sector (Hoogen et al., 2002). The overall 
loss rate from stationary equipment has been reduced to less 
than 5%, whilst the loss rate for automotive air conditioning has 
been reduced to less than 12%.
Inﬂuence of associated product-stewardship programmes
Product-stewardship programmes, sometimes known as produc-
er responsibility, have been established in numerous countries 
for a range of products that contain refrigerants and foam agents. 
The best examples are the WEEE and EOL Vehicle Directives 
in Europe, and the Japanese Appliance and Recycling Act. The 
recovery and recycling of refrigerators, air-conditioning units 
and motor vehicles provides for the extraction of refrigerant 
from systems, and also for the recovery of the blowing agent 
from foam. In Japan, where 1,800 tonnes of ﬂuorocarbons were 
recovered in 2003, electrical goods and automotive recycling 
programmes contributed 1,000 tonnes (RRC, 2003).
Foam
It is uncertain whether recovery, recycling or reclamation of the 
actual ﬂuorinated gases from foam products will increase in the 
future and thereby have a substantial impact on emissions. For 
CFC-11, recovery from foams is discouraged by the chemical’s 
low market value and by laws requiring the destruction of CFCs. 
For HFCs, recovery may be more attractive due to the higher 
market values of the chemicals. Even if the chemicals are not 
recovered, however, a major abatement option will be the re-
covery of used foam products and their subsequent destruction. 
Either destruction or chemical recovery could substantially re-
duce emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs from the banks in 
foams (see Table 7.10).
11.4.4 
Destruction technologies and capacities
11.4.4.1 Current situation
The decomposition or destruction of ozone-depleting substanc-
es, HFCs and PFCs can be achieved using various technologies. 
The commercially available and successfully demonstrated 
technologies are listed by region in Table 11.8. A more detailed 
overview of destruction technologies and capabilities can be 
found in Appendix 11C.
 
The costs for recovery and recovery/recycling units start at 
approximately US$ 500 per unit. Recovery, recycling and reuse 
costs may be offset by the savings in new refrigerant purchases. 
Contaminated and unwanted refrigerant can be destroyed for 
less than US$ 3 per kilogram. 
 
At the present time, the quantities of ﬂuorinated gases de-
stroyed by the techniques described above are extremely low;

potentially, they do not exceed a few thousand tonnes. In the 
European Union, the EU Regulation mandates the destruction 
of CFCs following their recovery; this also applies to foam in-
sulation when recovered from dismantled equipment. Similarly, 
CFCs recovered from refrigeration and air-conditioning equip-
ment must also be destroyed.
 
The different technologies involve varying costs, efﬂuents 
and emissions, energy usage, and destruction efﬁciencies.
11.4.4.2 Future opportunities
Considerable scope exists to increase the quantities of CFCs, 
HCFCs , HFCs and PFCs recovered and then destroyed at the 
end of their useful life. This particularly applies to the quanti-
ties that are “banked” in foam insulation products. Recovery 
and destruction could have a substantial impact on emissions 
of the ﬂuorinated gases. Further work is required to estimate 
whether the current number of destruction facilities globally 
could cope with the quantities of ﬂuorinated gases recovered 
and destroyed. Another concern would apply to regions and 
countries where destruction facilities do not exist and where 
transport regulations for hazardous wastes prevent their transfer 
to such facilities in other countries. 
11.5 
Scenarios for 2015
11.5.1 
Business-as-usual projections 
The previous chapters have developed business-as-usual (BAU) 
projections for the use and emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs 
and some PFCs (where these are used as replacements for 
ozone-depleting substances). These projections have assumed 
that all existing measures will remain in place, including the 
Montreal Protocol (phase-out) and relevant national regula-
tions. It is also assumed that the usual practices and emission 
rates will remain unchanged up to 2015 and that recovery ef-
ﬁciency will not increase. In order to facilitate the calculations 
of emissions, estimates have been made of the size of the bank 
of ozone-depleting substance and ﬂuorinated gases in equip-
ment and applications in 2002. Table 11.9 summarizes the key 
assumptions of the business-as-usual projections.
 
The activities underlying emissions of ﬂuorocarbons are ex-
pected to expand signiﬁcantly between now and 2015. These 
activities (such as the requirements for refrigeration, air condi-
tioning and insulation) will involve a number of technologies, 
including CFCs and HCFCs. In industrialized countries, the 
use and emissions of CFCs and HCFCs will decline as obsolete 
equipment is retired. In developing countries, ozone-deplet-
ing substances (particularly HCFCs) may be used for most of 
the ﬁrst half of this century and signiﬁcant growth is expected. 
These changes, and their impacts as developed by previous 
chapters, are reﬂected in the data in Table 11.2 (demand), 11.5 
(banks), and 11.6 (emissions).
 
The fall in CFC emissions is not accompanied by a similar 
increase in emissions of HFCs because of continuing trends to-
wards non-HFC technology and substitutes with lower GWPs. 
Additional factors not included in the BAU scenario are the 
capture and safe disposal of materials that would historically 
have been emitted. The business-as-usual case assumes the

continuing application of all existing measures and the alter-
native scenario(s) embody improvements that could be imple-
mented assuming global application of current best-practice 
emission reduction techniques.
Future emissions from use
Table 11.6 above shows, for the business-as-usual case, the ex-
pected future emissions arising from the use of HFCs in all sec-
tors, predominantly refrigeration, foam blowing, solvents and 
aerosols. Sectoral emission functions that reﬂect the current 
levels of containment were applied to the activities projected 
for these uses so that growth in emissions reﬂects growth in use. 
These emissions will be accompanied by signiﬁcant changes 
in the banks of ﬂuorocarbons remaining in equipment and not 
yet released. In the case of HFC-134a, the quantity retained in 
equipment is expected to increase in this scenario to 2.2 million 
metric tonnes by 2015 from the 2002 level of 517,000 metric 
tonnes (Ashford et al., 2004).
 
Growth was calculated as a projection of current demand 
patterns and has no connection to the global capability to pro-
duce HFCs. The most important of these materials continues 
to be HFC-134a. However, current production capacity for this 
material is about 180,000 tonnes yr –1, so that the increase in de-
mand (and therefore emissions) after 2008 cannot be sustained 
and would require the construction of new plants.
 
Future atmospheric concentrations of HFC-134a that would 
result from these emissions (solid line) are indicated in Figure 
11.2. In the second scenario (dashed line), the current best prac-
tices for containment are implemented in all new equipment, 
recovery efﬁciency and the extent of recovery are improved, 
and the quantities in systems are reduced. This has the effect 
of reducing the atmospheric concentration (and also the cli-
mate impact) in 2015 by some 23% but still requires additional 
capacity. The projected emissions are given in Table 11.6 as 
well. In this case, no expansion of current capacity would be 
needed.
Byproduct emissions of HFC-23
Emissions of HFC-23 from the production of HCFC-22 have 
signiﬁcant climate impact. As discussed above, these emissions 
may be reduced by changes to process procedures or eliminated 
by thermal oxidation without compromising the ability to pro-
duce HCFC-22, which will continue to be required as a ﬂuo-
ropolymer feedstock after its commercial uses have been phased 
out. The emissions of HFC-23 expected under the business-as-
usual case to 2015 are shown in Table 10.10. It has been as-
sumed that emissions from existing capacity (in both developed 
and developing countries) will continue at 2% of HCFC-22 pro-
duction and that new capacity (mainly in developing countries) 
will emit HFC-23 at a rate of 4%. Consequently, emissions of 
HFC-23 could increase by 60% between now and 2015 from 
about 15,000 tonnes yr–1 in 2003 to 23,000 tonnes yr–1.
 
The US EPA (2004) has developed a business-as-usual sce-
nario for HFC-23, projecting emissions of 100 MtCO2-eq in 
2000, 115 MtCO2-eq in 2010 and 130 MtCO2-eq in 2020. The 
difference between the EPA projections and those in this report 
is primarily due to EPA’s use of a lower emission factor for 
developing countries (3% instead of 4%).
11.5.2 
Mitigation scenario for supply and demand 
through to 2015
As shown above, previous chapters have identiﬁed the potential 
impact on demand (and supply) under BAU assumptions (i.e. 
all existing measures continue to be applied). These chapters 
have also considered the potential impact of the global appli-
cation of current best-practice emission reduction techniques. 
The key assumptions of the mitigation scenario are summarized 
again in Table 11.9, and Tables 11.2, 11.5, and 11.6 present the 
implications for demand, banks, and emissions.
Byproduct emissions of HFC-23
The alternative scenario for byproduct emissions of HFC-23 as-
sumes that the current best-practice technology, comprising the 
capture and thermal oxidation of “vent gases”, is introduced 
into all facilities progressively from 2005 onwards. Destruction 
technology is assumed to be 100% efﬁcient and to operate for 
90% of the on-line time of the HCFC-22 plant. Reduced emis-
sions were calculated on the basis of the same level of activ-
ity (in the form of assumed future HCFC-22 production) as the 
business-as-usual case. The difference between the two HFC-
23 forecasts is therefore solely due to the extent of deployment 
of destruction technology. The forecasts represent potential ex-
treme cases and future changes in activity will tend to increase 
the probability of one forecast or the other.
11.5.3 
Comparison with other scenarios
Future global HFC and PFC use and/or emissions as substitutes 
for ozone-depleting substances have been separately estimated 
by IPCC (2000), Midgley and McCulloch (1999), McCulloch 
(2000) and Madronich et al. (1999). Midgley and McCulloch 
(1999) projected carbon-equivalent emissions of HFCs and 
PFCs (excluding unintended chemical byproduct emissions) at 
60 MtC-eq in 2000, 150 MtC-eq in 2010 and 280 MtC-eq in 
2020 (220, 550 and 1030 MtCO2-eq, respectively). Considering 
that emissions lag behind consumption by many years, the 
Midgley and McCulloch ﬁgures are much larger than the val-
ues in Madronich et al. This discrepancy is consistent with the 
Midgley and McCulloch scenario which was constructed to rep-
resent plausible upper limits to future emissions (McFarland, 
1999).
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published 
in its Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC, 2000), sce-
narios for emissions of HFCs through to 2100 (Figure 2.9 and 
Table 11.10). Scenarios are alternative images of how the future 
might unfold and are used to analyze the effects of different 
driving forces on emissions outcomes and to allow contingency 
planning; they are not predictions or projections of future emis-
sions. The emission values contained within the SRES report

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
are scenarios of potential emissions to the year 2100 assuming 
that no action is taken to limit emissions based on concerns over 
climate change. The scenarios are based upon historical market 
information and expected developments in use and emissions. 
Projected emissions in SRES are lower than the reported 2015 
emissions in the BAU scenario of this report, although annual 
growth rates are more or less the same (Table 11.11). These dif-
ferences are the consequence of differences in scenario method-
ologies and assumptions. 
 
The Mitigation Scenario demonstrates that emission levels 
can be signiﬁcantly reduced below those of business as usual 
leading to reductions of over 200,000 metric tonnes of HFCs 
(Table 11.11). This clearly demonstrates that potential beneﬁts 
could be gained by implementing measures such as improved 
containment, recovery and recycling and end of life treatment 
of HFCs. Such measures would reduce the environmental im-
pact of HFCs and PFCs and allow the beneﬁts of their use in 
many applications (such as energy efﬁciency, non-ﬂammability 
etc.) to be maintained.
 
A paper by Harnisch and Höhne (2002) contains estimates 
of historic emissions based on atmospheric concentrations. 
These are consistent with the data in this chapter and in AFEAS 
(2004) and Madronich et al., 1999. A similar paper on haloge-
nated compounds and climate change (Harnisch et al., 2002) 
contains graphical estimates of future emissions in which HFC-
23 levels are expected to fall markedly (potentially a factor of 5

to 10 between 1996 and 2020). This is consistent with the HFC-
23 mitigation scenario rather than the business-as-usual scenar-
io. The same seems to apply to future emissions of HFCs:
• The total HFC emissions in the graph in Harnisch et al. 
(2002) are approximately 200, 450 and 700 MtCO2-eq yr–1 
for the years 1996, 2010 and 2020 (IPCC (1996) SAR val-
ues for GWPs).
• In this report (using 1996 SAR/ 2001 TAR GWP values for 
consistency), the values for the business-as-usual scenario 
are 375 MtCO2-eq yr–1 in 2002 (159 MtCO2-eq of which are 
from HFC-23), increasing to 1001 MtCO2-eq in 2015 (272 
MtCO2-eq of which are from HFC-23). 
• In the mitigation scenario, these emissions are reduced to 
368 MtCO2-eq yr–1 in 2015 (27 MtCO2-eq of which are from 
HFC-23).
The Harnisch et al. (2002) numbers are, therefore, consistent 
with this report up to 2010; from then on they continue to in-
crease, whereas the mitigation scenario envisages emissions 
under better control. Similarly, the values calculated for devel-
oped countries by the US EPA (2001) are also consistent with 
those considered here (as the sub-set of the same countries in 
the global databases).
11.5.4 
Aggregate additional emission reduction 
opportunities
Tables 11.11 and 11.12 summarize the projections of the busi-
ness-as-usual and mitigation scenario emissions for 2015. In 
the business-as-usual scenario, total direct emissions are pro-
jected to represent approximately 2.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1 in 2015 
(2.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values), as compared to 
about 2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 in 2002 (2.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/
TAR values).
 
Refrigeration applications, and stationary and mobile air-
conditioning (MAC) contribute most to global direct green-
house-gas emissions. A signiﬁcant reduction in CFC emissions, 
notably from refrigeration banks, can be expected during the 
next decade (CFC emissions fall to approximately 0.3 GtCO2-
eq yr–1 in 2015). Most greenhouse-gas emissions from foams 
are expected to occur after 2015. HCFC emissions are projected 
to increase by a factor of two between 2002 and 2015, owing 
to a steep increase in the use in refrigeration and air-condition-
ing (AC) applications, in particular in commercial refrigeration 
and stationary air-conditioning (commercial refrigeration rep-
resents about 25% of the total of all refrigeration, AC and MAC 
systems). HFC emissions are projected to increase by about a 
factor of three, particularly in refrigeration, the stationary AC 
and MAC sectors, and due to byproduct emissions of HFC-23 
during HCFC-22 production. It is expected that these projected 
increases will be accompanied by a build-up of banks and a cor-
responding added potential for future radiative forcing, depend-
ing on bank management and, notably, end-of-life measures. 
Action in these sub-sectors could therefore have a substantial 
inﬂuence on future emissions of HCFCs and HFCs.
 
There are opportunities to reduce direct emissions signiﬁ-
cantly through the global application of best practices and re-
covery methods, with a reduction potential of about 1.2 GtCO2-
eq yr–1 (1.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values) of direct 
emissions by 2015, as compared to the BAU scenario. About 
60% of this potential is HFC emission reduction; HCFCs and 
CFCs contribute about 30% and 10% respectively. A key fac-
tor determining whether this potential will be realized are the 
costs associated with the implementation of the measures to 
achieve the emission reduction. These vary considerably from 
a net beneﬁt to 300 US$/tCO2-eq (Chapters 4–10 of this report, 
US- EPA, 2004). Chapters 4–10 of this report have identiﬁed 
various reduction opportunities. The major opportunities for 
reducing greenhouse-gas emissions in the period prior to 2015 
include:
  
Refrigeration: In refrigeration applications, direct green-
house-gas emissions can be reduced by 10% to 30%. For the 
refrigeration sector as a whole, the mitigation scenario indicates 
an overall direct-emission reduction of about 490 MtCO2-eq

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
yr–1 by 2015 (411 MtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values), with 
most being predicted for commercial refrigeration. Speciﬁc 
costs are in the range of 10 to 300 US$/tCO2-eq2. Improved 
system energy efﬁciencies can also signiﬁcantly reduce indirect 
greenhouse-gas emissions. In full supermarket systems, reduc-
tions of values for life cycle climate performance (LCCP) of 
up to 60% can be obtained by using direct expansion systems 
with alternative refrigerants, improved containment, distributed 
systems, indirect systems or cascade systems.
 
The emission reduction potential in domestic refrigeration 
is relatively small. Indirect emissions of systems using either 
HFC-134a or isobutane (HC-600a) dominate total emissions, 
practically regardless of the carbon intensity of electric power 
generation. The difference between the LCCP of HFC-134a and 
isobutane systems is small and end-of-life recovery can further 
reduce the magnitude of the difference.
 
Residential and commercial air conditioning and heat-
ing: Direct greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions of residential 
and commercial air conditioning and heating equipment can 
be reduced by about 200 MtCO2-eq yr–1 (169 MtCO2-eq yr–1 
using SAR/TAR values) relative to the BAU scenario (2015). 
Speciﬁc costs range from –3 to 170 US$/tCO2-eq2. Improved 
system energy efﬁciencies can signiﬁcantly reduce indirect 
GHG emissions, leading in some cases to overall savings of 75 
US$/tCO2-eq. Opportunities to reduce direct GHG (i.e. refrig-
erant) emissions can be found in (i) more efﬁcient recovery of 
refrigerant at end-of-life (in the mitigation scenario, this is as-
sumed to be up to 50% and 80% for developing and developed 
countries, respectively); (ii) charge reduction (up to 20%); (iii) 
better containment and (iv) the use of non-ﬂuorocarbon refrig-
erants in suitable applications. 
 
Mobile air-conditioning: In mobile air-conditioning, a re-
duction potential of 179 MtCO2-eq yr–1 (162 MtCO2-eq yr–1 us-
ing SAR/TAR values) could be achieved by 2015 at a cost of 
20 to 250 US$/tCO2-eq2. Speciﬁc costs differ per region and 
per solution. Improved containment, and end-of-life recovery 
(both of CFC-12 and HFC-134a) and recycling (of HFC-134a), 
could reduce direct GHG emissions by up to 50%, and total (di-
rect and indirect) GHG emissions of MAC units by 30 to 40%. 
New systems with either CO2 or HFC-152a are likely to pen-
etrate the market in the coming decade, leading to total GHG 
system emission reductions estimated at 50 to 70% in 2015. 
Hydrocarbons are in use as service refrigerants in several coun-
tries, despite manufacturer recommendations. 
 
Foams: Because of the long life span of most foam applica-
tions, only a limited emission reduction of about 17 MtCO2-eq 
yr–1 (about 15 MtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values) by 2015 
is projected, with costs ranging from 10 to 100 US$/tCO2-eq2. 
There are two key areas of potential emission reduction in the 
foams sector. The ﬁrst is a potential reduction in halocarbon 
use in newly manufactured foams. However, the enhanced use 
of blends and the further phase-out of ﬂuorocarbon use both 
depend on further technology development and market accep-
tance. Action to reduce HFC use by 50% between 2010 and 
2015 would result in an emission reduction of about 10 MtCO2-
eq yr–1 (about 9 MtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values), with 
further reductions thereafter, at a cost of 15 to 100 US$/tCO2-
eq2. 
 
The second opportunity can be found in the worldwide 
banks of halocarbons contained in insulating foams in exist-
ing buildings and appliances (about 9 and 1 GtCO2-eq for CFC 
and HCFC respectively in 2002 (about 7 and 1 GtCO2-eq us-
ing SAR/TAR values)). Although recovery effectiveness is yet 
to be proven, particularly in the buildings sector, commercial 
operations are already recovering halocarbons at 10 to 50 US$/
tCO2-eq2 for appliances. Emission reductions may be about 7 
MtCO2-eq yr–1 (about 6 MtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values) 
in 2015. However, this potential could increase signiﬁcantly in 
the period between 2030 and 2050, when large quantities of 
building insulation foams will be decommissioned.
 
Medical Aerosols: The reduction potential for medical aero-
sols is limited due to medical constraints, the low emission lev-
el and the higher costs of alternatives. The major contribution 
(14 MtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2015 compared to a BAU emission of 
40 MtCO2-eq yr–1 (using SAR/TAR values, this is 10 as com-
pared to 34 MtCO2-eq yr–1) to a reduction of GHG emissions 
for metered dose inhalers (MDIs) would be achieved by the 
completion of the transition from CFC to HFC MDIs beyond 
what is already assumed to be BAU. The health and safety of 
the patient is of paramount importance in treatment decisions, 
and there are signiﬁcant medical constraints on the use of HFC 
MDIs. If salbutamol MDIs (approximately 50% of total MDIs) 
were to be replaced by dry powder inhalers (this is not an as-
sumption in the mitigation scenario) this would only result in an 
annual emission reduction of about 10 MtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2015, 
at a project cost in the range of 150 to 300 US$/tCO2-eq.
 
Fire protection: In ﬁre protection, the potential reduction 
by 2015 is small due to the relatively low emission level, the 
signiﬁcant shifts to not-in-kind alternatives in the past and the 
lengthy procedures for introducing new equipment. Direct 
GHG emissions for the sector are estimated at about 5 MtCO2-
eq yr–1 (about 4 MtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR values) in 2015 
(BAU). Agents with no climate impact have replaced 75% of 
original halon use . Four percent of the original halon appli-
cations continue to employ halons. The remaining 21% has 
been replaced by HFCs, with a small number of applications 
switching to HCFCs and to PFCs. PFCs are no longer needed 
for new ﬁxed systems and are limited to use as propellants in 
one manufacturer’s portable-extinguisher agent blend. Due to 
the lengthy process of testing, approval and market acceptance 
for new types of equipment and agents for ﬁre protection, no 
additional options are likely to have an appreciable impact by 
2015. With the introduction of a ﬂuoroketone (FK) in 2002, ad-
ditional reductions at increased cost will be possible in this sec-
tor through 2015. Currently, those reductions are estimated to

account energy efﬁciency, improvements may even result in net negative spe-
ciﬁc costs (savings).

be small compared to other sectors.
 
For non-medical aerosols and solvents, the reduction po-
tentials are likely to be rather small because most remaining 
uses are critical to performance or safety. The projected BAU 
emissions by 2015 for solvents and aerosols are about 14 and 
23 MtCO2-eq yr–1 respectively (the ﬁgures are about the same 
with SAR/TAR values). The replacement of HFC-134a by 
HFC-152a in technical aerosol dusters is a leading option for 
reducing GHG emissions. For contact cleaners and mould re-
lease agents for plastic casting, the substitution of HCFCs by 
HFEs and HFCs with lower GWPs offers an opportunity. Some 
countries have banned HFC use in novelty aerosol products, 
although HFC-134a continues to be used in many countries for 
safety reasons.
 
A variety of organic solvents can replace HFCs, PFCs and 
ozone-depleting substances in many applications. These alter-
native ﬂuids include lower-GWP compounds such as traditional 
chlorinated solvents, HFEs, and n-propyl bromide. Many not-
in-kind technologies, including hydrocarbon and oxygenated 
solvents, are also viable alternatives in some applications.
 
The destruction of byproduct emissions of HFC-23 from 
HCFC-22 production has a reduction potential of up to 300 
MtCO2-eq yr-1 by 2015 (245 MtCO2-eq yr–1 using SAR/TAR 
values) and speciﬁc costs below 0.2 US$/tCO2-eq according to 
two European studies in 2000. Reduction of HCFC-22 produc-
tion due to market forces or national policies, or improvements 
in facility design and construction also could reduce HFC-23 
emissions.

Appendix 11A Chemical routes of manufacture 
Manufacturing HFCs and PFCs involves complex processes, 
and the handling of the highly toxic chemical, anhydrous hy-
drogen ﬂuoride (HF). This has resulted in low global numbers 
of manufacturers and production units being situated where 
there is relatively straightforward access to raw materials and 
the basic infrastructure to handle toxic chemicals. In general, 
companies that have, or are currently, manufacturing CFCs and/
or HCFCs are now producing HFCs. PFC manufacture requires 
more complex manufacturing processes and is generally car-
ried out by specialist companies on a smaller scale than HFC 
production.
 
The main routes for the manufacture of HFCs, HCFCs and 
PFCs are shown in Figure 11A.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Appendix 11B Analysis of the potential reasons for 
discrepancies in calculated emissions and the means of 
reconciling data sets
The origins of discrepancy
The average residence time of a ﬂuorocarbon in equipment or 
other products varies from less than a year to many decades, 
depending on the application. At the time of the publication of 
the ozone-depletion hypothesis by Molina and Rowland (1974), 
ﬂuorocarbons were mainly used as propellants in aerosols, re-
sulting in rapid emissions of these gases to the atmosphere 
within a year of sale. Use as propellants, and other applications 
with rapid emissions, have largely disappeared in developed 
countries (AFEAS, 2004; Montzka and Fraser, 2002) and are 
gradually being minimized in developing countries. Current 
ﬂuorocarbon consumption is dominated by their continuing use 
in applications with relatively slow emissions to the atmosphere 
such as refrigerant and closed-cell foam applications. The slow 
emission of refrigerants and blowing agents establish banks, 
which can emit ﬂuorocarbons for prolonged periods and long 
after consumption of the chemical has ceased. 
 
When calculating banks of ﬂuorocarbon and other chemi-
cals in refrigeration and in foams, it is necessary to study sales 
of equipment and/or products, lifetime aspects, leakage during 
use, and end-of-life issues. This bottom-up approach is based 
on data from surveys, which must be well designed to ensure 
complete coverage. However, there are usually cross-checks to 
ensure completeness. Emission factors for refrigeration equip-
ment and foams have been assessed over several years. These 
vary signiﬁcantly according to the application and good market 
analysis is required to ensure the use of appropriately weighted 
emission factors. The differences between consumption and 
forecast emissions using these functions are assigned to banks, 
which accrue and diminish with time. Veriﬁcation of the physi-
cal existence of these banks (e.g. Mizuno, 2003) has largely 
served to conﬁrm the appropriateness of the emission functions 
adopted, although year-to-year emission projections can have 
signiﬁcant error bars for banks that release slowly (e.g. foams), 
particularly where emission projections are largely based on 
end-of-life practices. These year-to-year errors tend to be offset 
with time, making the level of conﬁdence greater over a multi-
year period3.
 
Observations of concentrations of long-lived species in 
the atmosphere can be used to estimate past emissions. If the 
lifetime of the chemical is long enough and the rate of mix-
ing is sufﬁcient to ensure a more or less homogeneous con-
centration in the whole lower troposphere, then past emis-
sions can be derived by simple inverse modelling using

3 For instance, it is difﬁcult to assess with any accuracy the number of domestic 
refrigerators that will be decommissioned in a given year, but it is much easier 
to assess the number that will be decommissioned in a ten-year period based on 
the knowledge of the age proﬁle of the global stock.

the change in observed concentration and the lifetime of 
the species (see Table TS-2 in the Technical Summary). 
 
Measurements of long-lived species are performed frequent-
ly and with high accuracy in several measurement networks. 
The uncertainty in derived emissions depends on the uncertain-
ty in the trend in observed concentration and on the uncertainty 
in the lifetime. Both are relatively small for most species. Using 
different measurement networks may also yield different emis-
sions and therefore information about the uncertainty. On this 
basis, the uncertainty in derived emissions is about 10% for CFC-
11 and between 1% and 6% for other long-lived halocarbons. 
 
The determination of emissions via the bottom-up method 
has revealed substantial discrepancies with the emissions calcu-
lated from atmospheric measurements of the same chemicals. 
However, closer analysis of these discrepancies has found that 
even relatively small levels of consumption of ﬂuorocarbons 
in rapidly emitting uses in developing countries can dominate 
emissions for speciﬁc chemicals (e.g. CFC-11) in speciﬁc years. 
This implies that there is a need to investigate production data, 
both from producers as reported to AFEAS and from countries 
as submitted to UNEP under the Montreal Protocol (Article 7 
on data reporting), in order to determine where such emissions 
might appear. However, the key weakness in the UNEP data set 
is that it makes no provision for the recording of use patterns. 
Nonetheless, the quantiﬁcation of the gap between UNEP pro-
duction/consumption data and AFEAS data is essential. 
Production and consumption issues
Since 1987, countries have reported production and consump-
tion data as well as exports and imports for each of the relevant 
CFC and HCFC chemicals to UNEP. UNEP publishes aggre-
gated data for production and consumption on an annual basis 
(in ODP tonnes) for developed (i.e., non-Article 5(1)) and de-
veloping (i.e., Article 5(1)) countries. Annual production data 
for certain groups of countries can also be obtained, although 
data at the country level are conﬁdential. 
 
Since 1976, the chemical industry has voluntarily reported 
the production and sales of ﬂuorocarbons through a survey com-
piled by an independent accountant. The purpose is to provide 
the scientiﬁc community with data estimating the atmospheric 
release of CFCs and the alternative ﬂuorocarbons. Data are cur-
rently available up until 2002 for all relevant CFCs, HCFCs 
and HFCs. The sum of all CFC production reported as above 
to AFEAS in 2002 was only 3% of the total in the peak year, 
1988 (AFEAS, 2004). The alternatives initially grew rapidly 
after their introduction to replace CFCs but currently have var-
ied growth rates, with most levelling off as they become more 
mature products (Table 11B). 
 
The companies surveyed by AFEAS include subsidiaries 
and joint ventures in all developed and many developing coun-
tries. Some production in developing countries, for example 
in China, India and Korea, is not included in the survey. The 
data collected by AFEAS for 2002 are thought (by comparison 
with the UNEP totals for production) to cover about 30-35% of 
global CFC production. Global coverage is much greater in the 
AFEAS survey for the HCFCs and HFCs. The AFEAS data cur-
rently cover 73% of all non-feedstock HCFC production, and 
are thought to represent at least 97% of global HFC production 
(AFEAS, 2004). Table 11B shows the decreasing trend in the 
coverage of the production reported to AFEAS in the total. 
 
With respect to the accuracy of reporting, the numbers re-

ported to AFEAS and the ones reported by the same countries 
to UNEP concur quite well in the early 1990s for CFC-11 and 
CFC-12. The differences increase after 1995, particularly for 
CFC-11, where there seems to be a systematic over-reporting to 
UNEP, or under-reporting to AFEAS, whilst the differences for 
CFC-12 remain more or less the same, also because quantities 
are larger. Reporting for HCFC-22 generally shows signiﬁcant 
under-reporting by UNEP compared to AFEAS, with differenc-
es in the order of 10% or more. In the case of HCFC-22 it can 
be clearly seen that the quantity produced in 2002 by countries 
not reporting to AFEAS is more than 40% of the total. In the 
case of HCFC-141b, the agreement between AFEAS and UNEP 
reporting is remarkably good, with annual differences smaller 
than about 5%. 
Determining use patterns and emissions
Annual production and sales data are reported to AFEAS for 
each of the 12 ﬂuorocarbons surveyed. Sales are divided into 
use categories – refrigeration, foam blowing distinguishing be-
tween open-and closed-cell foams, aerosols, and all other uses 
– to the best knowledge of the ﬂuorocarbon producers. Some 
degree of geographical breakdown is also provided but the 
AFEAS survey does not distinguish between developing and 
developed countries. Emissions of the individual ﬂuorocarbons 
to the atmosphere are estimated by applying emission factors 
to the sales reported in each use category. These factors are de-
rived from a consideration of the respective emission patterns 
and release delays for each application but are not always as 
sophisticated as those used in the bottom-up assessments. By 
way of an example, the allocation of all HCFC-141b foam sales 
to “closed-cell foams” may be inappropriate in view of uses in 
integral skin and other more rapid-release foam applications. 
 
This said, estimates of atmospheric concentrations based on 
production statistics provided by manufacturers and national 
governments coupled with historical emission factors were, un-
til recently, a good match with observations (McCulloch et al., 
2001, 2003), largely because of the dominance of rapid-release 
applications in developed countries. However, as the detailed 
assessment of delayed-release applications has become more 
important in developed countries and the gap between UNEP 
data and AFEAS data has increased, reﬂecting higher levels of 
activity in developing countries, the lack of use pattern data via 
the UNEP reporting structure is now a key impediment, particu-
larly where usage might be occurring in rapid-release applica-
tions. 
 
The improvement of knowledge about the use of the indi-
vidual chemicals, both in the developed and in the developing 
countries, as well as uncertainties in emissions factors from 
banks following the bottom-up method, is unlikely to bear fruit 
within the time scale of this report. This has implications for the 
calculation of emission scenarios for the period 2002-2015, in 
particular the contributions from developing countries. It may 
therefore be the case that the emissions are signiﬁcantly larger 
than calculated via the bottom-up method for refrigeration and 
foams only because of additional contributions from rapid-re-
lease applications. 
 
In addition, the emission factors applied to HCFCs and 
HFCs were derived from those developed earlier for CFCs and 
HCFC-22. However, there have been considerable changes in 
use practices in the wake of the Montreal Protocol and emission 
factors are subject to continual review. Revised emission factors, 
as described in McCulloch et al. (2001 and 2003), have helped 
improve the situation and have been used in the most recent cal-
culation of emissions (AFEAS, 2004). Nonetheless, the view is 
that variation and uncertainties in emission factors per se are less 
signiﬁcant overall than uncertainties in overall use pattern dis-
tributions between rapid-release applications and the delayed-
release applications represented by refrigeration and foams.  
 
This implies that, in the near future, further study is needed 
of the use patterns for the total production forecast for the pe-
riod 2002-2015 in both the developed and the developing coun-
tries. Further study will also be needed to make more precise 
estimates of future emissions from banks in refrigeration and 
foams, given the accuracy of calculations of the size of the 
banks and the emissions derived from them, as well as servic-
ing practices, and issues relating to recovery and recycling and 
end-of-life..

Appendix 11C Destruction technologies and capacities
The decomposition or destruction of ozone-depleting sub-
stances, HFCs and PFCsSGG can be achieved using various 
technologies. The commercially developed and successfully 
demonstrated technologies are described brieﬂy in this section. 
Commercially available operations are also listed by region. 
The main source documents upon which this section is based 
are as follows:
• Proceedings of the International Workshop on the Disposal 
of Ozone-depleting Substances (UNEP, 2000).
• Guidance Document on Disposal Technologies for Ozone-
depleting Substances (ODS) in Canada (Environment 
Canada, 2001)
• Refrigerant Recovery, Recycling, Reclamation and Disposal 
– an International Assessment, (Snelson and Bouma, 2003, 
Part 2)
The Canadian study reported, in their Guidance Document, 16 
available and potentially efﬁcacious technologies for the ef-
fective destruction of ODSs. The selected technologies all had 
stack emissions of less than 0.1 ng/m3 toxic equivalence for 
dioxins and furans, destruction or conversion efﬁciency not less 
than 99.7%, and the potential to be commercially available in 
2003.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
vary from 60 kg/hr for ﬂuorocarbons to 120 kg/hr for halons. 
Waste refrigerants are rapidly heated to 3000oC where pyrolysis 
occurs. This process is followed by rapid alkaline quenching 
that prevents the formation of dioxins and furans. Neutralization 
occurs with alkaline liquor. The waste gases, CO2 and argon are 
vented, whilst the resulting halide salt solution consisting of 
NaCl and NaF is discharged to wastewater treatment.
Inductively Coupled Radio Frequency Plasma (ICRF)
This process does not require the electrodes needed for the DC 
process as the energy coupling to the plasma is achieved through 
the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the induction coil. A demonstra-
tion plant operated from 1993 to 1996, during which time 2443 
tonnes of CFC-12 was destroyed. Gaseous CFCs and steam are 
fed through the plasma torch where they are heated and enter 
directly into the destruction reactor maintained at approximate-
ly 2000oC. The subsequent gases are cooled and scrubbed with 
a caustic solution to remove acid gases. This process has been 
commercialized in Japan by Ichikawa Kankyo Engineering. 
Neutralization occurs with the use of Ca(OH)2, resulting in sol-
id waste CaF2 and CaCl2. An average of 50 tonnes per annum 
was destroyed during the second half of the 1990s.
Reactor Cracking
The reactor cracking process uses a cylindrical water-cooled re-
actor made of graphite, and an oxygen-hydrogen burner system. 
The reactor is ﬂanged directly to an absorber. Waste refriger-
ants are fed into the reaction chamber where the temperature is 
maintained at between 2000oC and 2600oC. The waste is bro-
ken down into HF, HCl, Cl2, CO2, and H2O. The cracked prod-
ucts are cooled in the absorber and the acid gases puriﬁed and 
recovered at technical grade quality. This is the most widely 
used commercial process for the destruction of ﬂuorocarbons in 
Europe. The plant and technology are owned and operated by 
Solvay. In mid-2000, approximately 7000 Mt of ﬂuorocarbons 
had been decomposed with a reactor capacity of 200 kg/hr. 
Gaseous/Fume Oxidation
The gaseous/fume process uses refractory-lined combustion 
chambers for the thermal destruction of waste vapour streams. 
Waste ﬂuorocarbons may be destroyed by feeding directly from 
their pressurized storage into the incinerator. Fume incinera-
tors are typically found installed with manufacturing plants and 
are seldom used for commercial hazardous waste incineration. 
A version of this process known as High Temperature Steam 
Decomposition is operated by Ineos Fluor at Mihara in Japan. 
The rated throughput for CFCs is up to 165 kg/hr. Neutralization 
occurs with the use of Ca(OH)2, resulting in solid waste CaF2 
and CaCl2.
Liquid Injection
Liquid injection incinerators are usually single chamber units 
with one or more waste burners into which liquid waste is in-
jected, atomized into ﬁne droplets, and burned in suspension. 
Problems of ﬂame stability may result with high concentrations 
of ﬂuorocarbons. This process has not been applied commer-
cially to waste refrigerants. In Japan, Asahi Glass operates a 
liquid injection incinerator. The process involves two-stage 
neutralization using NaOH and Ca(OH)2.
Cement Kiln
Existing cement kilns can destroy organic compounds as the 
temperature in the burning zone is over 1500oC with a relatively 
long residence time. The disadvantage is that ﬂuorine and chlo-
rine input rates need to be carefully monitored. Fluorine can be 
beneﬁcial to the cement process whereas chlorine is generally 
regarded as an unwanted constituent.
Rotary Kiln
Rotary kiln incinerators are refractory-lined rotating cylindri-
cal steel shells mounted on a slight incline from the horizon-
tal. Most rotary kilns are equipped with an after-burner which 
ensures complete destruction of exhaust gases. Waste gases 
can be fed into the rotary kiln or directly into the after-burner. 
Rotary kilns are most frequently incorporated into the design of 
commercial incinerator facilities. Because of the production of 
acid byproducts, there are generally severe restrictions on the 
amount of halocarbons in the raw material feed.
Demonstrated and pilot processes
Alternating Current Plasma (ACP)
AC plasma is produced directly with 60 Hz high-voltage power 
but in other respects is similar to ICRF. CFCs have been effec-
tively destroyed in a demonstration plant but the process is not 
commercially available for this application.
Solvated Electron
The solvated electron process is a batch process operated at 
atmospheric pressure using two vessels: one heated reaction 
vessel, and the other a refrigerated ammonia recycle vessel. 
Refrigerants are decomposed in the reaction vessel with liquid 
ammonia and metallic sodium. The resulting wastes are chieﬂy 
halide salts and biodegradable organic compounds. On a pilot 
scale, the process has been shown to destroy various ﬂuorocar-
bons at an efﬁciency of 99.99% but a commercial facility for 
this application has not been established.
Gas Phase Chemical Reduction
This process involves the preheating of liquid or gas with boiler 
steam before injection into the reactor. The atomized gas mix-
ture is heated by vertical radiant tubes with internal electric 
heating elements to approximately 850oC. Organic compounds 
are ultimately reduced to methane, hydrochloric acids and low-
molecular-weight hydrocarbons. The formation of some di-
oxins and furans is possible. Hydrochloric acid is neutralized 
by caustic soda, and a scrubbing system removes inorganics. 
Hydrogen and methane are recovered for energy use. This pro-
cess has successfully destroyed other wastes on a commercial 
basis but not ﬂuorocarbons.

Chapter 11:  HFCs and PFCs: Current and Future Supply, Demand and Emissions, plus Emissions of CFCs, HCFCs and Halons 435
Catalytic Dehalogenation
In this process, CFCs are destroyed over a proprietary metal 
oxide catalyst at 400oC at atmospheric pressure. The resulting 
HF and HCL are absorbed in a lime solution. This process has 
been commercialized for other chlorinated compounds but not 
ﬂuorocarbons.
Liquid Phase Chemical Conversion
This technology uses a liquid-phase chemical conversion pro-
cess operating between 80oC and 120oC, where waste is reacted 
with a blend of potassium hydroxide and polyethylene glycol. 
Pilot-scale tests have proven a capability for ﬂuorocarbons and 
the process is used commercially for other chlorinated sub-
stances.
Vitriﬁcation
This process ﬁxes the products of chlorinated chemical disso-
ciation and hydrolysis into chemically durable glass frit, which 
can be processed into glass products. The process has not been 
applied to ﬂuorocarbons but has been proven effective for other 
chlorinated substances.
Internally Circulating Fluidized Bed (ICFB)
This process involves the waste refrigerant and air being blown 
through the incinerator ﬂuidized bed, where the refrigerant is 
broken down by the presence of methane and hydrogen in the 
reducing atmosphere. The process has been proven to be suc-
cessful but has not been commercialized.

Glossary
Absorption (Refrigeration)
A process by which a material (the absorbent) extracts one or 
more substances (absorbates) from a liquid or gaseous medium 
that it is in contact with and changes chemically, physically 
or both. The process is accompanied by a change in entropy, 
which makes it a useful mechanism for a refrigeration cycle. 
Water-lithium bromine and ammonia-water →chillers are ex-
amples of absorption chillers. 
Adjustment Time
See: →Lifetime in relation to atmospheric concentrations, or →
response time in relation to the climate system.
Aerosol
A suspension of very ﬁne solid or liquid particles in a gas. 
Aerosol is also used as a common name for a spray (or ‘aero-
sol’) can, in which a container is ﬁlled with a product and a 
propellant and is pressurized so as to release the product in a 
ﬁne spray.
Age of Air
The length of time that a stratospheric air mass has been out of 
contact with the well-mixed →troposphere. The content of a 
unit element of air at a particular location and particular time 
of year in the →stratosphere can be thought of as a mixture of 
different air parcels that have taken different routes from the →
tropopause to arrive at that location. The mean age of air at a 
speciﬁc location is deﬁned as the average transit times of the 
elements since their last contact with the tropopause. 
Alcohols
→Hydrocarbon derivatives in which at least one hydrogen atom 
has been replaced by an -OH group. Alcohols are sometimes 
used as solvents. 
Annex B Countries/Parties (Kyoto Protocol)
The group of countries included in Annex B in the →Kyoto 
Protocol that have agreed to a target for their →greenhouse-gas 
emissions. It includes all the →Annex I countries (as amended 
in 1998) except Turkey and Belarus. See also: →Non-Annex I 
countries/parties.
Annex I Countries/Parties (Climate Convention)
The group of countries included in Annex I (as amended in 1998) 
to the →United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC). It includes all the developed countries in 
the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD), and →countries with economies in transition. By 
default, the other countries are referred to as →Non-Annex I 
countries. See also: →Annex B countries/parties.
Anthropogenic
Resulting from or produced by human beings.
Aqueous Cleaning
Cleaning parts of equipment with water, to which may be added 
suitable detergents, saponiﬁers or other additives. 
Article 5(1) Countries (Montreal Protocol)
Developing countries that are →Party to the →Montreal 
Protocol. These countries are permitted a ten-year grace period 
in the phase-out schedule in the →Montreal Protocol compared 
with developed countries. 
Note: The deﬁnitions in this glossary refer to the use of the terms in the context of this report. A ‘→’ indicates that the following 
term is also contained in this glossary. The glossary provides an explanation of speciﬁc terms as the lead authors intend them to 
be interpreted in this report.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Atmosphere
The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth. The dry atmo-
sphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (N2) (78.1% volume 
→mixing ratio) and oxygen (O2) (20.9% volume mixing ratio). 
The remaining 1% consists of trace gases, such as argon (Ar) 
(0.93% volume mixing ratio), helium (He), and radiatively 
active →greenhouse gases such as →carbon dioxide (CO2) 
(0.037% volume mixing ratio in 2004) and →ozone (O3). In ad-
dition, the atmosphere contains water vapour, whose amount is 
highly variable, clouds and both liquid and particulate aerosols. 
Most of the matter in the atmosphere occurs in the →tropo-
sphere immediately above the Earth’s surface and the overlying 
→stratosphere.
Atmospheric Lifetime
A measure of the average time that a molecule remains intact 
once released into the →atmosphere. See also: →Lifetime. 
Azeotrope (Refrigeration)
A →blend consisting of one or more →refrigerants of different 
volatilities that does not appreciably change in composition or 
temperature as it evaporates (boils) or condenses (liqueﬁes) un-
der constant pressure. Refrigerant blends assigned an R-500 se-
ries number designation by ANSI/ASHRAE 34 are azeotropes. 
Compare with: →Zeotrope.
Banks
Banks are the total amount of substances contained in existing 
equipment, chemical stockpiles, foams and other products not 
yet released to the atmosphere.
Baseline
A non-intervention →scenario used as a base in the analysis of 
intervention scenarios. See also: →Business-As-usual (BAU) 
Scenario.
Best Practice
For this Report, best practice is considered the lowest achieva-
ble value of halocarbon emission at a given date, using commer-
cially proven technologies in the production, use, substitution, 
recovery and destruction of halocarbon or halocarbon-based 
products.
Blends/Mixtures (Refrigeration)
A mixture of two or more pure ﬂuids. Blends are used to achieve 
properties that ﬁt many refrigeration purposes. For example, a 
mixture of ﬂammable and nonﬂammable components can re-
sult in a nonﬂammable blend. Blends can be divided into three 
categories: →azeotropic, →non-azeotropic and near-azeotropic 
blends. 
Blowing Agent (Foams)
A gas, volatile liquid or chemical that generates gas during the 
foaming process. The gas creates bubbles or cells in the plastic 
structure of a foam. 
Bottom-Up Models
A modelling approach that aggregates information from diverse 
sources, often including technological and engineering details 
in the analysis. Compare with: →Top-down models.
Business-As-Usual (BAU) Scenario (2015, This Report)
A →baseline scenario for the use of →halocarbons and their 
alternatives, which assumes that all existing regulation and →
phase-out measures, including the →Montreal Protocol and rel-
evant national regulations, continue to 2015. The usual practic-
es (including end-of-life recovery) and emission rates are kept 
unchanged up to 2015. 
Capital Costs
Costs associated with capital or investment expenditure on land, 
plant, equipment and inventories. Unlike labour and operating 
costs, capital costs are independent of the level of output for a 
given capacity of production.
Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
A naturally occurring gas which occurs as a byproduct of burn-
ing →fossil fuels and biomass, as well as other industrial pro-
cesses and land-use changes. It is the principal →anthropogenic 
→greenhouse gas that affects the Earth’s radiative balance and 
is the reference gas against which other greenhouse gases are 
generally measured.
Catalyst
A chemical that acts to speed up or facilitate a chemical reac-
tion, but is not physically changed or used up in the reaction. 
Chiller
A cooling system that removes heat from one medium (water) 
and deposits it into another (ambient air or water).
Chlorine Loading
The total amount of chlorine (generally expressed as a →mix-
ing ratio, or fraction of all air molecules), accounting for the 
amount of all chlorine-bearing substances and the number of 
atoms of chlorine in each substance.
Chlorocarbons 
→Halocarbons containing carbon and chlorine atoms, but no 
other →halogen atoms.
Chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs)
→Halocarbons containing only chlorine, ﬂuorine and carbon 
atoms. CFCs are both →ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) 
and →greenhouse gases. 
Class A Fire (Fire Protection)
Fire in ordinary combustible materials, such as wood, cloth, pa-
per, rubber and many plastics.
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   450
15-08-2005   10:57:05
Annex II: Glossary
451
Class B Fire (Fire Protection)
Fire in ﬂammable liquids, oils, greases, tars, oil-base paints, 
lacquers and ﬂammable gases.
Class C Fire (Fire Protection)
Fire that involves energized electrical equipment where the elec-
trical resistivity of the extinguishing media is of importance.
Clean Agent (Fire Protection)
An electrically non-conducting, volatile or gaseous ﬁre-extin-
guishing agent that does not leave a residue upon evaporation.
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
Deﬁned in Article 12 of the →Kyoto Protocol, the Clean 
Development Mechanism is intended to meet two objectives: 
(1) to assist →non-Annex I Parties in achieving sustainable de-
velopment and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the 
convention; and (2) to assist →Annex I Parties in achieving 
compliance with their quantiﬁed emission limitation and reduc-
tion commitments. Certiﬁed emission reductions from Clean 
Development Mechanism projects undertaken in non-Annex I 
countries that limit or reduce →greenhouse-gas emissions, when 
certiﬁed by operational entities designated by the→Conference 
of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties, can be accrued to the in-
vestor (government or industry) from Parties in →Annex B. A 
share of the proceeds from the certiﬁed project activities is used 
to cover administrative expenses as well as to assist developing 
country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse 
effects of →climate change to meet the costs of adaptation.
Climate
Climate in a narrow sense is usually deﬁned as the ‘average 
weather’, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in 
terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a 
period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions 
of years. The classical period is 30 years, as deﬁned by the →
World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities 
are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipita-
tion, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a 
statistical description, of the climate system.
Climate Change
Climate change refers to a statistically signiﬁcant variation in 
either the mean state of the →climate or in its variability, per-
sisting for an extended period (typically decades or longer). 
Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or ex-
ternal forcings, or to persistent →anthropogenic changes in the 
composition of the atmosphere or in land use.
 
Note that Article 1 of the →Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) deﬁnes ‘climate change’ as ‘a 
change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to 
human activity that alters the composition of the global atmo-
sphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability, 
observed over comparable time periods’. The UNFCCC thus 
makes a distinction between ‘climate change’ attributable to hu-
man activities altering the atmospheric composition, and ‘cli-
mate variability’ attributable to natural causes.
Climate Feedback
An interaction mechanism between processes in the →climate 
system occurring when the result of an initial process triggers 
changes in a second process that in turn inﬂuences the initial 
one. A positive feedback intensiﬁes the original process, where-
as a negative feedback weakens it.
Climate Scenario
A plausible and often simpliﬁed representation of the future 
climate, based on a coherent and internally consistent set of 
driving forces and key relations, that has been constructed for 
use in investigating the potential consequences of →anthro-
pogenic →climate change, and often serves as input to impact 
models. Climate →projections often serve as the raw material 
for constructing climate scenarios, but climate scenarios usu-
ally require additional information, such as the baseline current 
climate. A climate-change scenario is the difference between a 
climate scenario and the current climate.
Climate Sensitivity
In IPCC Reports, equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the 
equilibrium change in global mean surface temperature fol-
lowing a doubling of the atmospheric (→equivalent) →carbon 
dioxide (CO2) concentrations. More generally, equilibrium cli-
mate sensitivity refers to the equilibrium change in surface air 
temperature following a unit change in →radiative forcing (in 
units of °C per (W m–2)). 
 
In practice, the evaluation of the equilibrium climate sen-
sitivity requires very long simulations with coupled general 
circulation models. The effective climate sensitivity is a related 
measure that circumvents this requirement. It is evaluated from 
model output for evolving non-equilibrium conditions. It is a 
measure of the strengths of the →feedbacks at a particular time 
and may vary with forcing history and climate state.
Climate System
The highly complex system that consists of ﬁve major compo-
nents: the →atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the 
land surface and the biosphere, as well as of the interactions 
between them. The climate system evolves over time under the 
inﬂuence of its own internal dynamics and because of external 
forcings, such as volcanic eruptions, solar variations and hu-
man-induced forcings (such as the changing composition of the 
atmosphere and land-use change).
Climate Variability
Variations in the mean state and other statistics (such as the 
standard deviation and the occurrence of extremes) of the →
climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of indi-
vidual weather events. Climate variability may be caused by 
natural internal processes within the →climate system (internal 
variability), or by variations in natural or anthropogenic exter-
nal forcings (external variability). See also: →Climate change.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
CO2-Equivalent
The amount of →carbon dioxide (CO2) that would cause the 
same amount of →radiative forcing as a given amount of anoth-
er →greenhouse gas. When used with concentrations this refers 
to the instantaneous radiative forcing caused by the greenhouse 
gas or the equivalent amount of CO2. When used with emis-
sions this refers to the time-integrated radiative forcing over a 
speciﬁed time horizon caused by the change in concentration 
produced by the emissions. See also: →Global warming po-
tential.
Coefﬁcient of Performance (COP) (Refrigeration)
A measure of the energy efﬁciency of a refrigerating system. 
It is deﬁned as the ratio between the refrigerating capacity and 
the electric power consumed by the system. The COP is primar-
ily dependant on the working cycle and the temperature levels 
(evaporating/condensing temperature) as well as on the proper-
ties of the →refrigerant, system design and size.
Column Ozone
The total amount of →ozone in a vertical column above the 
Earth’s surface. Column ozone is measured in →Dobson units 
(DU).
Commercialization
A sequence of actions necessary to achieve market entry and 
general market competitiveness of new technologies, processes 
and products.
Compressor Discharge Temperature (Refrigeration)
The temperature of a gas at the high-pressure outlet from the 
compressor (superheated gas). The gas temperature is typically 
30°C to 40°C higher than the condensing temperature at satura-
tion pressure, mainly depending on the evaporating/condens-
ing temperature, →refrigerant properties and the compressor 
energy efﬁciency. 
Conference of the Parties (COP) (Climate Convention)
The supreme body of the →United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), comprising coun-
tries that have ratiﬁed or acceded to the UNFCCC. See also: →
Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties and →Meeting 
of the Parties.
Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties (COP/
MOP) (Climate Convention)
The →Conference of the Parties of the →United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will 
serve as the →Meeting of the Parties (MOP), the supreme body 
of the →Kyoto Protocol, but only Parties to the Kyoto Protocol 
may participate in deliberations and make decisions. 
Containment (Refrigeration)
The application of service techniques or special equipment de-
signed to preclude or reduce loss of →refrigerant from equip-
ment during installation, operation, service or disposal of re-
frigeration and air-conditioning equipment. 
Controlled Substance
Under the →Montreal Protocol, any →ozone-depleting sub-
stance (ODS) that is subject to control measures, such as a →
phase-out requirement. 
Cost Effective
A criterion that speciﬁes that a technology or measure delivers 
a good or service at equal or lower cost than current practice, or 
the least-cost alternative for the achievement of a given target.
Countries with Economies in Transition (CEITs)
Countries with national economies in the process of changing 
from a planned economic system to a market economy. 
Destruction
Destruction of →ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) by ap-
proved destruction plants, in order to avoid their emissions. 
Detergent
A product designed to render, for example, oils and greases 
soluble in water; usually made from synthetic →surfactants. 
Dobson Unit (DU)
A unit to measure total →column ozone. The number of Dobson 
units is the thickness, in units of 10–5 m, that the ozone column 
would occupy if compressed into a layer of uniform density at 
a pressure of 1013 hPa and a temperature of 0°C. One DU cor-
responds to a column of ozone containing 2.69 × 1020 molecules 
per square meter. Although column ozone can vary greatly, 300 
DU is a typical value.
Drop-In Replacement (Refrigeration)
The procedure for replacing →CFC refrigerants with non-CFC 
refrigerants in existing refrigerating, air-conditioning and heat-
pump plants without doing any plant modiﬁcations. However, 
drop-in procedures are normally referred to as →retroﬁtting be-
cause plants need minor modiﬁcations, such as the change of 
lubricant, and the replacement of the expansion device and the 
desiccant material. 
Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI) (Medical Aerosols)
An alternate technology to →metered dose inhalers (MDIs) that 
can be used if the medication being dispensed can be satisfac-
torily formulated as microﬁne powder, thus eliminating the use 
of a chemical propellant. 
Emission Factor
The coefﬁcient that relates actual →emissions to activity data 
as a standard rate of emission per unit of activity.
Emissions
The release of gases or →aerosols into the →atmosphere over a 
speciﬁed area and period of time.

Emission Scenario
A plausible representation of the future development of →emis-
sions of substances that are potentially radiatively active (e.g., 
→greenhouse gases and →aerosols), based on a coherent and 
internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces 
(such as demographic and socio-economic development, and 
technological change) and their key relationships. See also: →
Scenario (generic) and →climate scenario.
 
The IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (2000) 
presented emission scenarios, known as the →SRES scenarios, 
which have been used as a basis for the climate projections in 
the IPCC Third Assessment Report (2001) and in this report. 
Energy Balance
Averaged over the globe and over long time periods, the energy 
budget of the →climate system must be in balance. Because the 
climate system derives all its energy from the Sun, this balance 
implies that, globally, the amount of incoming →solar radiation 
must on average be equal to the sum of the outgoing reﬂected 
solar radiation and the outgoing →thermal infrared radiation 
emitted by the climate system. A perturbation of this global ra-
diation balance, be it →anthropogenic or natural, is called →
radiative forcing. 
Equivalent-CO2 
See →CO2-Equivalent.
Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC)
An index of the amount of chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) that is 
present in the →stratosphere in forms that can contribute to the 
depletion of →ozone. The EESC value takes into account dif-
ferent fractional releases of chlorine or bromine from different 
halocarbons and the much higher efﬁciency of bromine in the 
catalytic removal of ozone. See also: →Chlorine loading.
Ethers
Organic compounds with formula R-O-R, where O is an oxygen 
atom and R is not a hydrogen atom (H). 
Expansion Control Devices (Refrigeration)
A device, such as an expansion valve, expansion oriﬁce, turbine 
or capillary tube, that is used to control the mass ﬂow of a →
refrigerant from the high-pressure side to the low-pressure side 
of a refrigeration system. 
External Costs 
The costs arising from any human activity when the agent re-
sponsible for the activity does not take full account of the nega-
tive impacts on others of his or her actions. Similarly, when 
the impacts are positive and not accounted for in the actions of 
the agent responsible, they are referred to as external beneﬁts. 
Emissions of particulate pollution from an industrial installa-
tion affect the health of people in the vicinity, but this is not 
often considered, or is given inadequate weight, in private de-
cision making and there is no market for such impacts. Such 
a phenomenon is referred to as an externality, and the costs it 
imposes are referred to as the external costs.
External Forcing
See: →Climate system.
Externality
See: →External costs.
Feedback
See: →Climate feedback.
Fluorinated Ethers
→Ethers in which one or more hydrogen atoms have been re-
placed by ﬂuorine. 
Fluorocarbons
→Halocarbons containing ﬂuorine atoms, including →chloro-
ﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), →hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs), 
→hydroﬂuorocarbons 
(HFCs), 
and 
→perﬂuorocarbons 
(PFCs).
Fluoroketones (FKs)
Organic compounds in which two fully ﬂuorinated alkyl 
groups are attached to a carbonyl group (C=O).
Fossil Fuels
Carbon-based fuels derived from geological (fossil) carbon de-
posits. Examples include coal, oil and natural gas.
Framework Convention on Climate Change 
See:→United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC).
Global Warming Potential (GWP)
An index comparing the climate impact of an emission of a 
greenhouse gas relative to that of emitting the same amount of 
→carbon dioxide. GWPs are determined as the ratio of the time-
integrated →radiative forcing arising from a pulse emission of 
1 kg of a substance relative to that of 1 kg of carbon dioxide, 
over a ﬁxed time horizon. See also: →Radiative forcing.
Greenhouse Effect
→Greenhouse gases in the →atmosphere effectively absorb the 
→thermal infrared radiation that is emitted by the Earth’s sur-
face, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. The atmosphere 
emits radiation in all directions, including downward to the 
Earth’s surface. Greenhouse gases trap heat within the surface-
troposphere system and raise the temperature of the Earth’s sur-
face. This is called the natural greenhouse effect.
An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases leads to 
increased absorption of infrared radiation and causes a →radia-
tive forcing, or energy imbalance, that is compensated for by an 
increase in the temperature of the surface-troposphere system. 
This is the enhanced greenhouse effect.

IPCC/TEAP Special Report: Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System
Greenhouse Gases (GHGs)
The gaseous constituents of the →atmosphere, both natural and 
→anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation within the spec-
trum of the →thermal infrared radiation that is emitted by the 
Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere and by clouds. This property 
causes the →greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases 
in the Earth’s atmosphere are water vapour (H2O), →carbon di-
oxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and →ozone 
(O3). Moreover, there are a number of entirely →anthropogenic 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the →halocarbons 
and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances that are 
covered by the →Montreal Protocol. Some other trace gases, 
such as sulphur hexaﬂuoride (SF6), hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), 
and perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs), are also greenhouse gases.
Halocarbons
Chemical compounds containing carbon atoms, and one or 
more atoms of the →halogens chlorine (Cl), ﬂuorine (F), bro-
mine (Br) or iodine (I). Fully halogenated halocarbons contain 
only carbon and halogen atoms, whereas partially halogenated 
halocarbons also contain hydrogen (H) atoms. Halocarbons 
that release chlorine, bromine or iodine into the →stratosphere 
cause →ozone depletion. Halocarbons are also →greenhouse 
gases. Halocarbons include →chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), 
→hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs), →hydroﬂuorocarbons 
(HFCs), →perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs) and →halons. 
Halogens
A family of chemical elements with similar chemical proper-
ties that includes ﬂuorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br) and 
iodine (I). 
Halons
Fully halogenated →halocarbons that contain bromine and ﬂu-
orine atoms.
Hermetic
An airtight sealed system. 
Hermetic Compressors (Refrigeration)
Compressors whose motors are sealed within the →refrigerant 
loop and are often cooled by the ﬂow of the →refrigerant-lubri-
cant mixture directly over the motor windings. 
Hydrocarbons (HCs)
Chemical compounds consisting of one or more carbon atoms 
surrounded only by hydrogen atoms. 
Hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs)
→Halocarbons containing only hydrogen, chlorine, ﬂuorine and 
carbon atoms. Because HCFCs contain chlorine, they contrib-
ute to →ozone depletion. They are also →greenhouse gases. 
Hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs)
→Halocarbons containing only carbon, hydrogen and ﬂuorine 
atoms. Because HFCs contain no chlorine, bromine or iodine, 
they do not deplete the →ozone layer. Like other halocarbons 
they are potent →greenhouse gases. 
Hydroﬂuoroethers (HFEs)
Chemicals composed of hydrogen, ﬂuorine and →ether, which 
have similar performance characteristics to certain →ozone-de-
pleting substances (ODSs) that are used as solvents.
Implementation Costs
Costs involved in the implementation of →mitigation options. 
These costs are associated with the necessary institutional 
changes, information requirements, market size, opportuni-
ties for technology gain and learning, and economic incentives 
(grants, subsidies and taxes). 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was 
jointly established by the →World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO) and the →United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) in 1988 to assess scientiﬁc, technical and socio-eco-
nomic information relevant for the understanding of climate 
change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and 
mitigation. It is open to all Members of the UN and of WMO. 
The IPCC provides, on request, scientiﬁc, technical and socio-
economic advice to the →Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 
→United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC). The IPCC has produced a series of Assessment 
Reports, Special Reports, Technical Papers, methodologies, 
and other products that have become standard works of refer-
ence and that are widely used by policymakers, scientists, and 
other experts.
Kyoto Protocol 
The Kyoto Protocol to the →United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted at the 
Third Session of the →Conference of the Parties (COP) to the 
UNFCCC in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. It contains legally binding 
commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. 
Countries included in →Annex B of the Protocol (most OECD 
countries and →countries with economies in transition) agreed 
to reduce their →anthropogenic →greenhouse-gas emissions 
(speciﬁcally →carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous 
oxide (N2O), →hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs), →perﬂuorocar-
bons (PFCs) and sulfur hexaﬂuoride (SF6)) by at least 5% be-
low 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. The 
Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005.
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
An assessment of the overall environmental impact of a prod-
uct over its entire life cycle (manufacture, use and recycling or 
disposal). 
Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP)
A measure of the overall global-warming impact of equipment 
based on the total related →emissions of →greenhouse gases 
over its entire life cycle. LCCP is an extension of the →total 
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   454

455
equivalent warming impact (TEWI). LCCP also takes into ac-
count the direct fugitive emissions arising during manufacture, 
and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their embod-
ied energy. 
Lifetime
Lifetime is a general term used for various time scales char-
acterizing the rates of processes affecting the concentration of 
trace gases. The following lifetimes may be distinguished:
 
Turnover time (T) is the ratio of the mass (M) of a reservoir 
(e.g., a gaseous compound in the →atmosphere) and the total 
rate of removal (S) from the reservoir: T = M/S. Separate turn-
over times can be deﬁned for each removal process. 
 
Adjustment time or response time (Ta) is a time scale charac-
terizing the decay of an instantaneous pulse input into the res-
ervoir. The term adjustment time is also used to characterize the 
adjustment of the mass of a reservoir following a step change in 
the source strength. Half-life or decay constant is used to quan-
tify a ﬁrst-order exponential decay process. See: →Response 
time, for a different deﬁnition pertinent to climate variations. 
The term lifetime is sometimes used, for simplicity, as a sur-
rogate for adjustment time.
 
In simple cases, such as CFC-11, where the global removal 
rate of the compound is proportional to the total mass of the 
reservoir, the adjustment time equals the turnover time: T = Ta. 
In more complex cases removal rates are not proportional to the 
reservoir mass – for example because of feedback effects – and 
this equality no longer holds. 
Longwave Radiation
See: →Thermal infrared radiation.
Lower Flammability Limit (LFL)
‘The minimum concentration of a combustible substance that is 
capable of propagating a ﬂame through a homogeneous mixture 
of the combustible and gaseous oxidizer under the speciﬁed 
conditions of test’ (ASTM Standard E 681-85). The conditions 
of test usually reported for →refrigerants are in dry air in ambi-
ent temperature and pressure. 
Lubricant
Typically a substance introduced between moving surfaces to 
reduce the friction and wear between them.
Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)
A safety advisory bulletin prepared by chemical producers for a 
speciﬁc →refrigerant or compound. 
Meeting of the Parties (to the Kyoto Protocol) (MOP)
→Conference of the Parties to the →United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change serving as the Meeting of the 
Parties (MOP) to the →Kyoto Protocol. It is the supreme body 
of the Kyoto Protocol. See also: →Conference of the Parties/
Meeting of the parties (COP/MOP).
Meeting of the Parties (to the Montreal Protocol) (MOP)
The supreme body of the Montreal Protocol.
Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) (Medical Aerosols)
A method of dispensing inhaled pulmonary drugs. See also: →
Dry powder inhaler (DPI).
Miscible
The ability of two liquids or gases to uniformly dissolve into 
each other. Immiscible liquids will separate into two distin-
guishable layers. 
Mitigation
A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks 
of →greenhouse gases.
Mixing Ratio
Mixing ratio, or mole fraction, is the ratio of the number of 
moles of a constituent in a given volume to the total number of 
moles of all constituents in that volume. It is usually reported 
for dry air. Typical values for long-lived →greenhouse gases 
range from µmol/mol (parts per million: ppm), nmol/mol (parts 
per billion: ppb), to fmol/mol (parts per trillion: ppt). Correcting 
the mixing ratio for the non-ideality of gases gives the volume 
mixing ratio (sometimes expressed in ppmv, etc.).
Mole Fraction
See: →Mixing ratio
Montreal Protocol
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone 
Layer was adopted in Montreal in 1987 and subsequently ad-
justed and amended in London (1990), Copenhagen (1992), 
Vienna (1995), Montreal (1997) and Beijing (1999). It controls 
the consumption and production of chlorine- and bromine-con-
taining chemicals (known as →ozone-depleting substances, 
ODSs) that destroy the stratospheric →ozone layer.
Multilateral Fund
Part of the ﬁnancial mechanism under the →Montreal Protocol, 
established by the →Parties to provide ﬁnancial and technical 
assistance to →Article 5 Parties.
Non-Annex I Parties/Countries (Climate Convention)
The countries that have ratiﬁed or acceded to the →United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
that are not included in →Annex I of the Climate Convention.
Non-Azeotropic (Refrigeration)
A →blend or mixture where the compositions of coexisting liq-
uid and vapour differ and condensation and evaporation occur 
over a range of temperatures. This effect can in some applica-
tions give improved performance in plants with heating/cooling 
demand with gliding temperatures. Heating of hot tap water is 
one example. Equipment has to be modiﬁed to use a non-azeo-
tropic blend. See also: →zeotropic, →azeotropic.

Non-Condensable Gases (Refrigeration)
Gases with very low temperature boiling points, which are not 
easily condensed. Nitrogen and oxygen are the most common 
ones found in →chillers. 
Nonlinearity
A process is called ‘nonlinear’ when there is no simple propor-
tional relation between cause and effect. The →climate system 
contains many nonlinear processes, resulting in a system with 
potentially very complex behaviour. Such complexity may lead 
to rapid climate change.
Normal Boiling Point (NBP)
The boiling point of a compound at atmospheric pressure (1013 
hPa). 
Not-in-Kind Technologies (NIK)
Not-in-kind technologies achieve the same product objective 
without the use of →halocarbons, typically with an alternative 
approach or unconventional technique. Examples include the 
use of stick or spray pump deodorants to replace CFC-12 aero-
sol deodorants; the use of mineral wool to replace CFC, HFC 
or HCFC insulating foam; and the use of dry powder inhalers 
(DPIs) to replace CFC or HFC metered dose inhalers (MDIs).
One-Component Foam (OCF)
A foam in which the →blowing agent acts both as a frothing 
agent and as a propellant. These foams are primarily used for 
gap ﬁlling (to prevent air inﬁltration) rather than for thermal in-
sulation per se. As such the use of blowing agent is fully emis-
sive.
Open Drive (Refrigeration)
A compressor drive motor that is outside the →refrigerant loop 
and therefore not directly exposed to the circulating refriger-
ant. 
Ozone
The triatomic form of oxygen (O3), which is a gaseous →at-
mospheric constituent. In the →troposphere it is created by 
photochemical reactions involving gases occurring naturally 
and resulting from →anthropogenic activities (→‘smog’). 
Tropospheric ozone acts as a →greenhouse gas. In the →strato-
sphere ozone is created by the interaction between solar →
ultraviolet radiation and molecular oxygen (O2). Stratospheric 
ozone plays a major role in the stratospheric radiative balance. 
Its concentration is highest in the →ozone layer.
Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODSs)
Substances known to deplete the stratospheric →ozone layer. 
The ODSs controlled under the →Montreal Protocol and its 
Amendments are →chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), →hydrochlo-
roﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs), →halons, methyl bromide (CH3Br), 
carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), 
hydrobromoﬂuorocarbons (HBFCs) and bromochloromethane 
(CH2BrCl). 
Ozone Depletion
Accelerated chemical destruction of the stratospheric →ozone 
layer by the presence of substances produced by human activi-
ties. 
Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP)
A relative index indicating the extent to which a chemical prod-
uct may cause →ozone depletion compared with the depletion 
caused by CFC-11. Speciﬁcally, the ODP of an →ozone-deplet-
ing substance (ODS) is deﬁned as the integrated change in to-
tal ozone per unit mass emission of that substance relative to 
the integrated change in total ozone per unit mass emission of 
CFC-11.
Ozone Layer
The layer in the →stratosphere where the concentration of →
ozone is greatest. The layer extends from about 12 to 40 km. 
This layer is being depleted by →anthropogenic emissions 
of chlorine and bromine compounds. Every year, during the 
Southern Hemisphere spring, a very strong depletion of the 
ozone layer takes place over the Antarctic region. This depletion 
is caused by anthropogenic chlorine and bromine compounds in 
combination with the speciﬁc meteorological conditions of that 
region. This phenomenon is called the Antarctic ozone hole.
Party
A country that signs and/or ratiﬁes an international legal instru-
ment (e.g., a protocol or an amendment to a protocol), indicat-
ing that it agrees to be bound by the rules set out therein. Parties 
to the →Montreal Protocol or →Kyoto Protocol are countries 
that have signed and ratiﬁed these Protocols. 
Perﬂuorocarbons (PFCs)
Synthetically produced →halocarbons containing only carbon 
and ﬂuorine atoms. They are characterized by extreme stability, 
non-ﬂammability, low toxicity, zero →ozone depleting poten-
tial and high →global warming potential. 
Phase-Out
The ending of all production and consumption of a chemical 
controlled under the →Montreal Protocol. 
Phase-Out Plan
The part of the Country Programme under the →Montreal 
Protocol that describes the strategy statement of a government 
deﬁning the →phase-out time schedule for each controlled sub-
stance and the government actions to be taken for achieving 
phase-out. It contains a prioritized list of projects to be under-
taken and takes into account the speciﬁc industrial, political and 
legislative situation in the country. 
Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs)
A class of clouds composed of particles, including nitric acid 
hydrates and ice, that occur at high altitudes (of about 15 to 30 
km) in the polar →stratosphere. They occur when the tempera-
ture is very low (below about –95°C), such as in the Antarctic 
→polar vortex, and have been observed mainly over Antarctica 
IPCC Boek (dik).indb   456

Annex II: Glossary
457
in the winter and spring, and occasionally over the Arctic. PSCs 
play a major role in →ozone depletion because chlorine is con-
verted to forms that are highly reactive with ozone through 
chemical reactions on or within the cloud particles. 
Polar Vortex
A dynamical structure that occurs during the polar winter in 
which →stratospheric air acquires a cyclonic circulation about 
the pole, with an area of relatively still air in its centre. The 
vortex core air (above 16 km in altitude) becomes effectively 
isolated from mid-latitude air. The polar vortex over Antarctica 
is usually colder and lasts longer (throughout the austral spring) 
than the polar vortex over the Arctic. 
ppm, ppb, ppt
See: →Mixing ratio.
Precursors
Atmospheric compounds which themselves are not →green-
house gasses or →aerosols, but which have an effect on green-
house-gas or aerosol concentrations by taking part in physical 
or chemical processes regulating their production or destruc-
tion rates.
Present Value Cost
The sum of all costs over all time periods, with future costs 
discounted.
Projection (Generic)
A potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, 
often computed with the aid of a model. Projections are distin-
guished from predictions in order to emphasize that projections 
involve assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-eco-
nomic and technological developments that may or may not be 
realized, and are therefore subject to substantial uncertainty.
Propellant
The component of an →aerosol spray that acts as a forcing 
agent to expel the product from the aerosol canister. 
Purge System (Refrigeration)
A device used on low-pressure chillers to expel air and other 
non-condensables from the circulating →refrigerant. 
Push-Pull Method (Refrigeration)
A method for →recovering and →recycling →refrigerant from 
a system using a negative pressure (suction) on one side to pull 
the old refrigerant out and pumping recycled refrigerant vapour 
to the other side to push the old refrigerant through the system. 
Radiative Efﬁciency
A measure of the efﬁciency of a gas in changing →radiative 
forcing. It is calculated as the marginal change in radiative forc-
ing per unit increase in gas concentration and typically given in 
units of W m–2 ppb–1.
Radiative Forcing
Radiative forcing is the change in the net irradiance (expressed 
in Watts per square meter: W m–2) at the →tropopause due to 
an internal change or a change in the external forcing of the 
→climate system, such as a change in the concentration of →
carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere or in the output of the 
Sun. Usually radiative forcing is computed after allowing for 
stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, 
but with all tropospheric properties held ﬁxed at their unper-
turbed values. Radiative forcing is called instantaneous if no 
change in stratospheric temperature is accounted for. See also: 
→Global warming potential.
Radiative Forcing Scenario
A plausible representation of the future development of →ra-
diative forcing associated, for example, with →anthropogenic 
changes in atmospheric composition or in land-use, or with 
natural factors such as variations in →solar activity. Radiative 
forcing scenarios can be used as input into simpliﬁed climate 
models to compute climate projections.
Radical
A molecular entity possessing an unpaired electron.
Reclamation
Reprocessing and upgrading of a recovered controlled sub-
stance through mechanisms such as ﬁltering, drying, distilla-
tion and chemical treatment in order to restore the substance to 
a speciﬁed standard of performance. Chemical analysis is re-
quired to determine that appropriate product speciﬁcations are 
met. It often involves processing off-site at a central facility. 
Recovery
The collection and storage of controlled substances from ma-
chinery, equipment, containment vessels, etc., during servicing 
or prior to disposal without necessarily testing or processing it 
in any way. 
Recycling
Reuse of a recovered controlled substance following a basic 
cleaning process such as ﬁltering and drying. For →refriger-
ants, recycling normally involves recharge back into equipment 
and it often occurs ‘on-site’. 
Refrigerant (Refrigeration)
A heat transfer agent, usually a liquid, used in equipment such 
as refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners. 
Relief Valve (Refrigeration)
A device that vents refrigerant when the pressure in a →chiller 
becomes dangerously high. Newer relief valves have a resealing 
mechanism so that when the pressure of the chiller returns to a 
normal level they reseal and prevent further refrigerant loss. 
Research, Development and Demonstration
Scientiﬁc or technical research and development of new pro-

duction processes or products, coupled with analysis and meas-
ures that provide information to potential users regarding the 
application of the new products or processes, such demonstra-
tion tests and studies of the feasibility of pilot plants and other 
pre-commercial applications.
Response Time (Climate System)
The response time or adjustment time is the time needed for 
the →climate system or its components to re-equilibrate to a 
new state, following a forcing resulting from external or inter-
nal processes. Different components of the climate system can 
have very different response times. The response time of the →
troposphere is relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the 
response time of the →stratosphere is typically a few months. 
The oceans have much longer response times, of decades to 
millennia, because of their large heat capacity. The response 
time of the strongly coupled surface-troposphere system is 
mainly determined by the oceans, and is therefore slow com-
pared with that of the stratosphere. The biosphere can respond 
quickly, for example to droughts, but it can also respond very 
slowly to other imposed changes.
 
See: →Lifetime, for the deﬁnition of response time in rela-
tion to atmospheric concentrations. 
Retroﬁt
The upgrading or adjustment of equipment so that it can be used 
under altered conditions; for example, of refrigeration equip-
ment to be able to use a non-ozone depleting refrigerant in place 
of a →chloroﬂuorocarbon (CFC). 
Saturated Vapour Pressure
The maximum vapour pressure of a substance at a given tem-
perature when accumulated over its liquid or solid state in a 
conﬁned space. 
Scenario (Generic)
A plausible and often simpliﬁed description of how the future 
may develop, based on a coherent and internally consistent 
set of driving forces and key relationships. Scenarios may be 
derived from →projections, but are often based on additional 
information from other sources, sometimes combined with a 
‘narrative storyline’. See also: →SRES scenarios, →climate 
scenario and →emission scenarios.
Semi-Aqueous Cleaning
Cleaning with a non-water-based cleaner, followed by a water 
rinse.
Servicing (Refrigeration)
In the refrigeration sector, all kinds of work that may be per-
formed by a service technician, from installation, operations, 
inspection, repair, retroﬁtting, redesign and decommissioning 
of refrigeration systems to handling, storage, recovery and re-
cycling of refrigerants, as well as record-keeping. 
Shortwave Radiation
See: →Solar radiation.
Smog
The buildup of high levels of pollution, generally in association 
with urban areas. Photochemical smog occurs in the →tropo-
sphere where sunlight causes chemical reactions in polluted air, 
one effect of which is the generation of →ozone. 
Solar Radiation
Radiation emitted by the Sun, most of which is shortwave ra-
diation at wavelengths less than about 1 µm and is determined 
by the temperature of the Sun. See also: →Ultraviolet radiation; 
compare with: →thermal infrared radiation.
Solvent
Any product (aqueous or organic) designed to clean a compo-
nent or assembly by dissolving the contaminants present on its 
surface. 
Speciﬁc Costs (of Abatement Options)
The difference in costs of an abatement option as compared 
with a reference case, expressed in relevant speciﬁc units. In 
this Report the speciﬁc costs of →greenhouse gas emission re-
duction options are generally expressed in US$ per tonne of 
avoided →CO2-equivalents (US$/tCO2-eq). 
SRES Scenarios
→Emission scenarios developed by the IPCC Special Report 
on Emission Scenarios (2000). 
Stratosphere
The highly stratiﬁed region of the →atmosphere above the →
troposphere. It extends from an altitude of about 8 km in high 
latitudes and 16 km in the tropics to an altitude of about 50 
km. This region is characterized by increasing temperature with 
altitude.
Stratospheric Polar Vortex
See: →Polar vortex
Surfactant
A product designed to reduce the surface tension of water. Also 
referred to as a tension-active agent/tenside. Detergents are 
made up principally from surfactants. 
Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP)
A standing subsidiary body of the Parties to the →Montreal 
Protocol, which was established in 1988 under Article 6 of the 
Montreal Protocol and is coordinated by the →United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) Ozone Secretariat. It com-
prises hundreds of experts from around the world. TEAP is re-
sponsible for conducting assessments and for reporting to the 
Parties on (a) the state of art of production and use technology, 
options to →phase-out the use of →ozone-depleting substances 
(ODSs), recycling, reuse and destruction techniques; and (b)

the economic effects of ozone layer modiﬁcation and the eco-
nomic aspects of technology.
Thermal Infrared Radiation
Radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, the →atmosphere and 
the clouds, with wavelengths longer than the wavelength of the 
red colour in the visible part of the spectrum. It is also known 
as terrestrial or longwave radiation. The spectrum of infrared 
radiation is distinct from that of →solar or shortwave radiation 
because of the large difference in temperature between the sur-
face of the Sun and the Earth.
Thermoplastic
A material that can repeatedly become plastic on heating and 
harden on cooling. Compare with: →Thermosetting.
Thermosetting
A material that sets permanently on heating. Compare with: →
Thermoplastic.
Threshold Limit Values (TLVs)
Exposure safety guidelines established by the American 
Conference of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists 
(ACGIH) based on an inhalation →time-weighted average. 
TLVs ‘represent conditions under which it is believed that near-
ly all workers can be repeatedly exposed day after day without 
adverse effects.’ For volatile substances, such as →refrigerants, 
TLVs are expressed as parts per million volume concentrations 
in air (ppm). 
Time-Weighted Average (TWA)
A technique used to measure the average exposure of workers 
to a chemical over a given period of time. 
Top-Down Models
A modelling approach that evaluates a system from aggregate 
variables. An example of a top-down model is that of applied 
macroeconomic theory and econometric techniques applied to 
historical data on consumption, prices, incomes and factor costs 
to model ﬁnal demand for goods and services, and supply from 
main sectors, like the energy sector, transportation, agriculture 
and industry. Compare with: →Bottom-up models. 
Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI)
A measure of the overall global-warming impact of equipment 
based on the total related →emissions of →greenhouse gases 
during the operation of the equipment and the disposal of the 
operating ﬂuids at the end-of-life. TEWI takes into account 
both direct fugitive emissions, and indirect emissions produced 
through the energy consumed in operating the equipment. TEWI 
is measured in units of mass of →CO2 equivalent. See also: →
Life cycle climate performance (LCCP).
Transitional Substance (Montreal Protocol)
Under the →Montreal Protocol, a chemical whose use is permit-
ted as a replacement for →ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), 
but only temporarily because the substance’s →ozone depletion 
potential (ODP) is non-zero. 
Tropopause
The boundary between the →troposphere and the →strato-
sphere.
Troposphere
The lowest part of the →atmosphere above the Earth’s surface, 
where clouds and ‘weather’ phenomena occur. The thickness 
of the troposphere is on average 9 km in high latitudes, 10 km 
in mid-latitudes, and 16 km in the tropics. Temperatures in the 
troposphere generally decrease with height.
Ultraviolet Radiation (UV)
Radiation from the Sun with wavelengths between visible light 
and X-rays. UV-B (280–320 nm), one of three bands of UV 
radiation, is harmful to life on the Earth’s surface and is mostly 
absorbed by the →ozone layer. 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
Established in 1972, UNEP is the specialized agency of the 
United Nations for environmental protection.
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC)
An international convention whose ultimate objective is the 
‘stabilization of →greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmo-
sphere at a level that would prevent dangerous →anthropogen-
ic interface with the →climate system’. The Convention was 
adopted on 9 May 1992 in New York and signed at the 1992 
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro by more than 150 countries and 
the European Community. It contains commitments for all →
Parties and entered into force in March 1994. See also: →Kyoto 
Protocol. 
Venting (Refrigeration)
A service practice where the →refrigerant vapour is allowed 
to escape into the →atmosphere after the refrigerant liquid has 
been recovered. 
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
Organic compounds that evaporate at their temperature of use. 
Many VOCs contribute to the formation of →tropospheric →
ozone and →smog. 
Voluntary Agreement
An agreement between a government authority and one or 
more private parties, as well as a unilateral commitment that 
is recognized by the public authority, to achieve environmental 
objectives or to improve environmental performance beyond 
compliance.
Voluntary Measures
Measures to reduce →greenhouse-gas emissions that are adopt-
ed by ﬁrms or other actors in the absence of government man-

dates. Voluntary measures help make climate-friendly products 
or processes more readily available or encourage consumers to 
incorporate environmental values in their market choices.
Well-Mixed Greenhouse Gases
→Greenhouse gases with lifetimes that are long compared with 
the mixing time between the two hemispheres (about 1 year), 
so that their mixing ratios do not have large gradients except, 
possibly, close to source regions.
World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
Established in 1950, WMO is the specialized agency of the 
United Nations for meteorology (weather and climate), opera-
tional hydrology and related geophysical sciences.
Zeotrope (Refrigeration)
A blend consisting of several →refrigerants of different vola-
tilities that appreciably changes in composition or temperature 
as it evaporates (boils) or condenses (liqueﬁes) at a given pres-
sure. A refrigerant blend assigned an R-400 series number des-
ignation in ANSI/ASHRAE 34 is a zeotrope. Compare with: →
