AND GEOLOGICAL STORAGE 
5.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is an option in the portfolio of actions that could be used to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the continued use of fossil fuels. 
At its simplest, the CCS process is a chain consisting of three major steps: the capture and compression of CO2 
(usually at a large industrial installation1
 ), its transport to a storage location and its long-term isolation from the 
atmosphere. IPCC (2005) has produced a Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (SRCCS), 
from which additional information on CCS can be obtained. The material in these Guidelines has been produced 
in consultation with the authors of the SRCCS.  
Geological storage can take place in natural underground reservoirs such as oil and gas fields, coal seams and 
saline water-bearing formations utilizing natural geological barriers to isolate the CO2 from the atmosphere. A 
description of the storage processes involved is given in Chapter 5 of the SRCCS. Geological CO2 storage may 
take place either at sites where the sole purpose is CO2 storage, or in tandem with enhanced oil recovery, 
enhanced gas recovery or enhanced coalbed methane recovery operations (EOR, EGR and ECBM respectively).  
These Guidelines provide emission estimation guidance for carbon dioxide transport, injection and geological 
storage (CCGS) only. No emissions estimation methods are provided for any other type of storage option such as 
ocean storage or conversion of CO2 into inert inorganic carbonates. With the exception of the mineral 
carbonation of certain waste materials, these technologies are at the research stage rather than the demonstration 
or later stages of technological development IPCC (2005). If and when they reach later stages of development, 
guidance for compiling inventories of emissions from these technologies may be given in future revisions of the 
Guidelines. 
Emissions resulting from fossil fuels used for capture, compression, transport, and injection of CO2, are not 
addressed in this chapter. Those emissions are included and reported in the national inventory as energy use in 
the appropriate stationary or mobile energy use categories. Fuel use by ships engaged in international transport 
will be excluded where necessary by the bunker rules, whatever the cargo, and it is undesirable to extend the 
bunker provisions to emissions from any energy used in operating pipelines.  
5.2 
OVERVIEW 
In these Guidelines, the CO2 capture and geological storage chain is subdivided into four systems (Figure 5.1)  
 
1. Capture and compression system. The systems boundary includes capture, compression and, where 
necessary, conditioning, for transport. 
2. Transport system. Pipelines and ships are considered the most likely means of large-scale CO2 transport. The 
upstream systems boundary is the outlet of the compression / conditioning plant in the capture and 
compression system. The downstream systems boundary is the downstream end of a transport pipeline, or a 
ship offloading facility. It should be noted that there may be compressor stations located along the pipeline 
system, which would be additional to any compression in System 1 or System 3. 
3. Injection system. The injection system comprises surface facilities at the injection site, e.g. storage facilities, 
distribution manifold at end of transport pipeline, distribution pipelines to wells, additional compression 
facilities, measurement and control systems, wellhead(s) and the injection wells. The upstream systems 
boundary is the downstream end of transport pipeline, or ship offloading facility. The downstream systems 
boundary is the geological storage reservoir. 
4. Storage system. The storage system comprises the geological storage reservoir.

natural gas processing, cement manufacture, ammonia production, hydrogen production and ethanol manufacturing plants.

This chapter does not include guidance for CO2 capture and compression. A brief summary and information on 
where to find emissions estimation guidelines for CO2 capture and compression can be found in Section 5.3. 
Guidelines for compiling inventories of emissions from the CO2 transport, injection and storage systems of the 
CCGS chain are given in Sections 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 of this Chapter, respectively. Fugitive emissions from surface 
facilities at EOR, EGR and ECBM site (with or without CO2 storage) are classified as oil and gas operations and 
Volume 2, Chapter 4 provides guidance on estimating these emissions. Emissions from underground storage 
reservoirs at EOR, EGR and ECBM sites are classified as emissions from geological storage sites and Section 
5.7 of this Chapter provides guidance on estimating these emissions.  
Table 5.1 shows the categories in which the emissions from the CO2 transport, injection and storage systems are 
reported. 
5.3 
CO2 CAPTURE 
Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions arise mainly from combustion of fossil fuels (and biomass) in the 
power generation, industrial, buildings and transport sectors. CO2 is also emitted from non-combustion sources 
in certain industrial processes such as cement manufacture, natural gas processing and hydrogen production.  
CO2 capture produces a concentrated stream of CO2 at high pressure that can be transported to a storage site and 
stored. In these Guidelines, the systems boundary for capture includes compression and any dehydration or other 
conditioning of the CO2 that takes place before transportation.  
Electric power plants and other large industrial facilities are the primary candidates for CO2 capture, although it 
is the high purity streams of CO2 separated from natural gas in the gas processing industry that have been 
captured and stored to date. Available technology is generally deployed in a way that captures around 85-95 
percent of the CO2 processed in a capture plant IPCC (2005). Figure 5.2, taken from the SRCCS provides an 
overview of the relevant processes. The main techniques are briefly described below. Further detail is available 
in Chapter 3 of the SRCCS: 
• 
Post-combustion capture: CO2 can be separated from the flue gases of the combustion plant or from natural 
gas streams and fed into a compression and dehydration unit to deliver a relatively clean and dry CO2 stream 
to a transportation system. These systems normally use a liquid solvent to capture the CO2. 
• 
Pre-combustion capture: This involves reacting a fuel with oxygen or air, and/or steam to produce a 
‘synthesis gas’ or ‘fuel gas’ composed mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The carbon monoxide is 
reacted with steam in a catalytic reactor, called a shift converter, to give CO2 and more hydrogen. CO2 is 
then separated from the gas mixture, usually by a physical or chemical absorption process, resulting in a 
hydrogen-rich fuel which can be used in many applications, such as boilers, furnaces, gas turbines and fuel 
cells. This technology is widely used in hydrogen production, which is used mainly for ammonia and 
fertilizer manufacture, and in petroleum refining operations. Guidance on how to estimate and report 
emissions from this process is provided in Chapter 2, section 2.3.4 of this Volume.

• 
Oxy-fuel capture: In oxy-fuel combustion, nearly pure oxygen is used for combustion instead of air, 
resulting in a flue gas that is mainly CO2 and H2O. This flue gas stream can directly be fed into a CO2 
compression and dehydration unit. This technology is at the demonstration stage. Guidance on how to 
estimate and report emissions from this process is provided in Chapter 2, section 2.3.4 of this volume.

As already mentioned in a number of industrial processes, chemical reactions lead to the formation of CO2 in 
quantities and concentrations that allow for direct capture or separation of the CO2 from their off gases, for 
example: ammonia production, cement manufacture, ethanol manufacture, hydrogen manufacture, iron and steel 
manufacture, and natural gas processing plant. 
Volume 2: Energy

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The location of guidelines for compiling inventories of emissions from the CO2 capture and compression system 
depends on the nature of the CO2 source:  
• 
Stationary combustion systems (mainly electric power and heat production plants): Volume 2, Chapter 2, 
Section 2.3.4.  
• 
Natural gas processing plants: Volume 2, Section 4.2.1. 
• 
Hydrogen production plants: Volume 2, Section 4.2.1. 
• 
Capture from other industrial processes: Volume 3 (IPPU) Chapter 1, Section 1.2.2, and specifically for 
(i) 
Cement manufacture: IPPU Volume, Section 2.2 
(ii) 
Methanol manufacture: IPPU Volume, Section 3.9 
(iii) 
Ammonia production: IPPU Volume, Section 3.2 
(iv) 
Iron and steel manufacture: IPPU Volume section 4.2 
Negative emissions may arise from the capture and compression system if CO2 generated by biomass 
combustion is captured. This is a correct procedure and negative emissions should be reported as such. 
Although many of the potential emissions pathways are common to all types of geological storage, some of the 
emission pathways in enhanced hydrocarbon recovery operations differ from those for geological CO2 storage 
without enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. In EOR operations, CO2 is injected into the oil reservoir, but a 
proportion of the amount injected is commonly produced along with oil, hydrocarbon gas and water at the 
production wells. The CO2-hydrocarbon gas mixture is separated from the crude oil and may be reinjected into 
the oil reservoir, used as fuel gas on site or sent to a gas processing plant for separation into CO2 and 
hydrocarbon gas, depending upon its hydrocarbon content. EGR and ECBM processes attempt to avoid CO2 
production because it is costly to separate the CO2 from a produced gas mixture. CO2 separated from the 
hydrocarbon gas may be recycled and re-injected in the EOR operation, or vented; depending on the economics 
of recycling versus injecting imported CO2. CO2-rich gas is also released from the crude oil storage tanks at the 
EOR operation. This vapour may be vented, flared or used as fuel gas depending upon its hydrocarbon content. 
Thus there are possibilities for additional sources of fugitive emissions from the venting of CO2 and the flaring or 
combustion of CO2-rich hydrocarbon gas, and also from any injected CO2 exported with the incremental 
hydrocarbons. These emissions along with fugitive emissions from surface operations at EOR, and EGR and 
ECBM sites (from the injection of CO2, and/or the production, recycling, venting, flaring or combustion of CO2-
rich hydrocarbon gas), and including any injected CO2 exported with the incremental hydrocarbons, can be 
estimated and reported using the higher methods described guidance given in Volume 2 Chapter 4.  
5.4 
CO2 TRANSPORT 
Fugitive emissions may arise e.g. from pipeline breaks, seals and valves, intermediate compressor stations on 
pipelines, intermediate storage facilities, ships transporting low temperature liquefied CO2, and ship loading and 
offloading facilities. Emissions from transport of captured CO2 are reported under category 1C (see Table 5.1). 
CO2 pipelines are the most prevalent means of bulk CO2 transport and are a mature market technology in 
operation today. Bulk transport of CO2 by ship also already takes place, though on a relatively minor scale. This 
occurs in insulated containers at temperatures well below ambient, and much lower pressures than pipeline 
transport. Transport by truck and rail is possible for small quantities of CO2, but unlikely to be significant in 
CCS because of the very large masses likely to be captured. Therefore no methods of calculating emissions from 
truck and rail transport are given here. Further information on CO2 transport is available in Chapter 4 of the 
SRCCS (IPCC 2005). 
5.4.1 
CO2 transport by pipeline 
To estimate emissions from pipeline transport of CO2, default emission factors can be derived from the emission 
factors for transmission (pipeline transport) of natural gas as provided in section 4.2 of this volume. The Tier 1 
emission factors for natural gas pipeline transport, presented in, Tables 4.2.4 and 4.2.5 are provided on the basis 
of gas throughput primarily because pipeline length is not a national statistic that is commonly available. 
However, fugitive emissions from pipeline transport are largely independent of the throughput, but depend on 
the size of and the equipment installed in the pipeline systems. Since it is assumed that there exists a relationship 
between the size of the systems and natural gas used, such an approach is acceptable as Tier 1 method for natural 
gas transport. 
Chapter 5: Carbon Dioxide Transport, Injection and Geological Storage 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.9 
The above might not be true for the transport of CO2 in CCS applications. Since it is good practice to treat both 
capture and storage in a per plant or facility basis, the length of the transporting CO2 pipeline system will be 
known and should be used to estimate emissions from transport.

in which

v is the linear velocity of the gas through the leak and, with the same size of the leak, is

• 
ρ is the density of the gas;  
• 
f is the dimensionless friction number 
• 
l/D (length divided by diameter) is characterizing the physical size of the system. 
For leaks, f = 1 and independent on the nature of the gas. So assuming the internal pressure of the 
pipe-line and the physical dimensions being the same for CO2 and CH4 transport, the leak-velocity 
is inversely proportional to the root of the density of the gas and hence proportional to the root of 
the molecular mass.  
So when ΔP is the same for methane and carbon dioxide

The molecule mass of CO2 is 44 and of CH4 is 16. So on a mass-basis the CO2-emission rate is

From this the default emission factors for CO2 pipeline transport are obtained by multiplying the 
relevant default emission factorsa in Table 4.2.8 for natural gas (is mainly CH4) by a factor of 1.66. 
Notes:  
a to convert the factors expressed in m3 to mass units, a specific mass of 0.7 kg/m3 for methane is 
applied. 
See chapter 5 in: R.H. Perry, D. Green, Perry's chemical engineers handbook, 6th edition, 
McGraw Hill Book Company - New York, 1984.  
Table 4.2.8 in section 4.2 of this volume provides indicative leakage factors for natural gas pipeline transport. To 
obtain Tier 1 default emission factors for CO2 transport by pipeline these values should be converted from cubic 
metres to mass units and multiplied by 1.66 (see Box 1). The resulting default emission factors are given in 
Table 5.2.

Although the leakage emissions from pipeline transport are independent of throughput, the number of leaks is 
not necessarily correlated to the length of the pipeline. The best correlation will be between the number and type 
of equipment components and the type of service. Most of the equipment tends to occur at the facilities 
connected to the pipeline rather than with the pipeline itself. In fact, unless the CO2 is being transported over 
very large distances and intermediate compressor stations are required, virtually all of the fugitive emissions 
from a CCS system will be associated with the initial CO2 capture and compression facilities at the start of the 
pipeline and the injection facilities at the end of the pipeline, with essentially no emissions from the pipeline 
itself. In Tier 3 approach, the leakage emissions from the transport pipeline could be obtained from data on 
number and type of equipment and equipment-specific emission factors. 
5.4.2 
CO2 transport by ship 
Default emission factors for fugitive emissions from CO2 transport by ship are not available. The amounts of gas 
should be metered during loading and discharge using flow metering and losses reported as fugitive emissions of 
CO2 resulting from transport by ship under category 1C1 b. 
5.4.3 
Intermediate storage facilities on CO2 transport 
routes 
If there is a temporal mismatch between supply and transport or storage capacity, a CO2 buffer (above ground or 
underground) might be needed to temporarily store the CO2. If the buffer is a tank, fugitive emissions should be 
measured and treated as part of the transport system and reported under category 1C1 c (other). If the 
intermediate storage facility (or buffer) is a geological storage reservoir, fugitive emissions from it can be treated 
in the same way as for any other geological storage reservoir (see Section 5.6 of this Chapter) and reported under 
category 1C3.  
5.5 
CO2 INJECTION 
The injection system comprises surface facilities at the injection site, e.g. storage facilities, any distribution 
manifold at the end of the transport pipeline, distribution pipelines to wells, additional compression facilities, 
measurement and control systems, wellhead(s) and the injection wells. Additional information on the design of 
injection wells can be found in the SRCCS, Chapter 5, Section 5.5. 
Meters at the wellhead measure the flow rate, temperature and pressure of the injected fluid. The wellhead also 
contains safety features to prevent the blowout of the injected fluids. Safety features, such as a downhole safety 
valve or check valve in the tubing, may also be inserted below ground level, to prevent backflow in the event of 
the failure of the surface equipment. Valve and other seals may be affected by supercritical CO2, so appropriate 
materials will need to be selected. Carbon steel and conventional cements may be liable to be attacked by highly 
saline brines and CO2-rich fluids (Scherer et al. 2005). Moreover the integrity of CO2 injection wells needs to be 
maintained for very long terms, so appropriate well construction materials and regulations will be needed. 
Cements used for sealing between the well and the rock formation and, after abandonment, plugging the well, 
must also be CO2/salt brine resistant over long terms. Such cements have been developed but need further testing. 
Due to the potential for wells to act as conduits for CO2 leakage back to the atmosphere, they should be 
monitored as part of a comprehensive monitoring plan as laid out in Section 5.7 of this Chapter. 
The amount of CO2 injected into a geological formation through a well can be monitored by equipment at the 
wellhead, just before it enters the injection well. A typical technique is described by Wright and Majek (1998). 
Meters at the wellhead continuously measure the pressure, temperature and flow rate of the injected gas. The 
Chapter 5: Carbon Dioxide Transport, Injection and Geological Storage 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.11 
composition of the imported CO2 commonly shows little variation and is analyzed periodically using a gas 
chromatograph. The mass of CO2 passing through the wellhead can then be calculated from the measured 
quantities. No default method is suggested and the reporting of the mass of CO2 injected as calculated from 
direct measurements is good practice.  
If the pressure of the CO2 arriving at the storage site is not as high as the required injection pressure, 
compression will be necessary. Any emissions from compression of the stored gas at the storage site should be 
measured and reported.  
5.6 
GEOLOGICAL STORAGE OF CO2 
Chapter 5 of the SRCCS (IPCC 2005) indicates that geological storage of carbon dioxide may take place onshore 
or offshore, in:  
• 
Deep saline formations. These are porous and permeable reservoir rocks containing saline water in their 
pore spaces.  
• 
Depleted or partially depleted oil fields - either as part of, or without, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) 
operations.  
• 
Depleted or partially depleted natural gas fields – either with or without enhanced gas recovery (EGR) 
operations.  
• 
Coal seams (= coal beds) – either with or without enhanced coalbed methane recovery (ECBM) operations.  
 Additionally, niche opportunities for storage may arise from other concepts such as storage in salt caverns, 
basalt formations and organic-rich shales. 
Further information on these type of storage sites and the trapping mechanisms that retain CO2 within them can 
be found in Chapter 5 of the SRCCS (IPCC 2005). 
5.6.1 
Description of emissions pathways/sources 
The Introduction to the SRCCS states that >99% of the CO2 stored in geological reservoirs is likely to remain 
there for over one thousand years. Therefore potential emissions pathways created or activated by slow or long-
term processes need to be considered as well as those that may act in the short to medium term (decades to 
centuries).  
In these Guidelines the term migration is defined as the movement of CO2 within and out of a geological storage 
reservoir whilst remaining below the ground surface or the sea bed, and the term leakage is defined as a transfer 
of CO2 from beneath the ground surface or sea bed to the atmosphere or ocean. 
The only emissions pathways that need to be considered in the accounting are CO2 leakage to the ground surface 
or seabed from the geological storage reservoir2. Potential emission pathways from the storage reservoir are 
shown in Table 5.3. 
There is a possibility that methane emissions, as well as CO2 emissions, could arise from geological storage 
reservoirs that contain hydrocarbons. Although there is insufficient information to provide guidance for 
estimating methane emissions, it would be good practice to undertake appropriate assessment of the potential for 
methane emissions from such reservoirs and, if necessary, include any such emissions attributable to the CO2 
storage process in the inventory.

METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
Geological conditions vary widely and only a few published studies of monitoring programmes that identify and 
quantify fugitive anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from geological storage operations currently exist 
(Arts et al. 2003, Wilson and Monea 2005; Klusman 2003a, b, c). Although the Summary for Policymakers of 
the SRCCS suggests that properly selected geological storage sites are likely to retain greater than 99 percent of 
the stored CO2 over 1000 years and may retain it for up to millions of years, at the time of writing, the small 
number of monitored storage sites means that there is insufficient empirical evidence to produce emission factors 
that could be applied to leakage from geological storage reservoirs. Consequently, this guidance does not include 
Tier 1 or Tier 2 methodology. However, there is the possibility of developing such methodologies in the future, 
when more monitored storage sites are in operation and existing sites have been operating for a long time 
(Yoshigahara et al. 2005). However a site-specific Tier 3 approach can be developed. Monitoring technologies 
have been developed and refined over the past 30 years in the oil and gas, groundwater and environmental 
monitoring industries (also see Annex 1). The suitability and efficacy of these technologies can be strongly 
influenced by the geology and potential emissions pathways at individual storage sites, so the choice of 
monitoring technologies will need to be made on a site-by-site basis. Monitoring technologies are advancing 
rapidly and it would be good practice to keep up to date on new technologies. 
Tier 3 procedures for estimating and reporting emissions from CO2 storage sites are summarised in Figure 5.3 
and discussed below.

In order to understand the fate of CO2 injected into geological reservoirs over long timescales, assess its potential 
to be emitted back to the atmosphere or seabed via the leakage pathways identified in Table 5.3, and measure 
any fugitive emissions, it is necessary to:  
(a) Properly and thoroughly characterise the geology of the storage site and surrounding strata;  
(b) Model the injection of CO2 into the storage reservoir and the future behaviour of the storage system;  
(c) Monitor the storage system;

Confirm that geology of storage site has been evaluated and that local and

Confirm that the potential for leakage has been evaluated through a combination 
of site characterization and realistic models that predict movement of CO2 over 
time and locations where emissions might occur.
Ensure that an adequate monitoring plan is in place. The monitoring plan should 
identify potential leakage pathways, measure leakage and/or validate update 
models as appropriate.

(d) Use the results of the monitoring to validate and/or update the models of the storage system. 
Proper site selection and characterization can help build confidence that there will be minimal leakage, improve 
modelling capabilities and results, and ultimately reduce the level of monitoring needed. Further information on 
site characterisation is available in the SRCCS and from the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas R & 
D Programme (IEAGHG 2005). 
Monitoring technologies have been developed and refined over the past 30 years in the oil and gas, groundwater 
and environmental monitoring industries. The most commonly used technologies are described in Tables 5.1-5.6 
in Annex I of this chapter. The suitability and efficacy of these technologies can be strongly influenced by the 
geology and potential emissions pathways at individual storage sites, so the choice of monitoring technologies 
will need to be made on a site-by-site basis. Monitoring technologies are advancing rapidly and it would be good 
practice to keep up to date on new technologies. 
A range of modelling tools is available, some of which have undergone a process of code inter-comparison 
(Pruess et al. 2004). All models approximate and/or neglect some processes, and make simplifications. Moreover, 
their results are dependent on their intrinsic qualities and, especially, on the quality of the data put into them. 
Many of the physico-chemical factors involved (changes in temperature and pressure, mixing of the injected gas 
with the fluids initially present in the reservoir, the type and rate of carbon dioxide immobilization mechanisms 
and fluid flow through the geological environment) can be modelled successfully with numerical modelling tools 
known as reservoir simulators. These are widely used in the oil and gas industry and have proved effective in 
predicting movement of gases and liquids, including CO2, through geological formations. 
Reservoir simulation can be used to predict the likely location, timing and flux of any emissions, which, in turn, 
could be checked using direct monitoring techniques. Thus it can be an extremely useful technique for assessing 
the risk of leakage from a storage site. However, currently there is no single model that can account for all the 
processes involved at the scales and resolution required. Thus, sometimes, additional numerical modelling 
techniques may need to be used to analyze aspects of the geology. Multi-phase reaction transport models, which 
are normally used for the evaluation of contaminant transport can be used to model transport of CO2 within the 
reservoir and CO2/water/rock reactions, and potential geomechanical effects may need to be considered using 
geomechanical models. Such models may be coupled to reservoir simulators or independent of them.  
Numerical simulations should be validated by direct measurements from the storage site, where possible. These 
measurements should be derived from a monitoring programme, and comparison between monitoring results and 
expectations used to improve the geological and numerical models. Expert opinion is needed to assess whether 
the geological and numerical modelling are valid representations of the storage site and surrounding strata and 
whether subsequent simulations give an adequate prediction of site performance.  
Monitoring should be conducted according to a suitable plan, as described below. This should take into account 
the expectations from the modelling on where leakage might occur, as well as measurements made over the 
entire zone in which CO2 is likely to be present. Site managers will typically be responsible for installing and 
operating carbon dioxide storage monitoring technologies (see Annex 1). The inventory compiler will need to 
ensure that it has sufficient information from each storage site to assess annual emissions in accordance with the 
guidance provided in this Chapter. To make this assessment, the inventory compiler should establish a formal 
arrangement with each site operator that will allow for annual reporting, review and verification of site-specific 
data.  
5.7.1 
Choice of method 
At the time of writing, the few CO2 storage sites that exist are part of petroleum production operations and are 
regulated as such. For example, acid gas storage operations in western Canada need to conform to requirements 
that deal with applications to operate conventional oil and gas reservoirs (Bachu and Gunter, 2005). Regulatory 
development for CCS is in its early stages. There are no national or international standards for performance of 
geological CO2 storage sites and many countries are currently developing relevant regulations to address the 
risks of leakage. Demonstration of monitoring technologies is a necessary part of this development (see Annex 
1). As these standards and regulatory approaches are developed and implemented, they may be able to provide 
emissions information with relative certainty. Therefore, as part of the annual inventory process, if one or more 
appropriate governing bodies that regulate carbon dioxide capture and storage exist, then the inventory compiler 
may obtain emissions information from those bodies. If the inventory compiler relies on this information, he/she 
should submit supporting documentation that explains how emissions were estimated or measured and how these 
methods are consistent with IPCC practice. If no such agency exists, then it would be good practice for the 
inventory compiler to follow the methodology presented below. In the methodology presented below, site 
characterization, modelling, assessment of the risk of leakage and monitoring activities are the responsibility of 
the storage project manager and/or an appropriate governing body that regulates carbon dioxide capture and 
Chapter 5: Carbon Dioxide Transport, Injection and Geological Storage 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.15 
storage. In addition, the storage project manager or regulatory authority will likely develop the emission 
estimates that will be reported to the national inventory compiler as part of the annual inventory process. The 
responsibility of the national inventory compiler is to request the emissions data and seek assurance of its 
validity. In the case of CCS associated with ECBM recovery, the methodology should be applied both to CO2 
and CH4 detection.  
1. Identify and document all geological storage operations in the jurisdiction. The inventory compiler should 
keep an updated record of all geological storage operations, including all the information needed to cross-
reference from this section to other elements of the CO2 capture and storage chain for QA/QC purposes, that is 
for each operation:  
• 
The location of the site; 
• 
The type of operation (whether or not associated with EOR, EGR, ECBM);  
• 
The year in which CO2 storage began; 
• 
Source(s), annual mass of CO2 injected attributable to each source and the imputed cumulative amount in 
storage; and 
• 
Associated CO2 transport, injection and recycling infrastructure, if appropriate (i.e. on-site generation and 
capture facilities, pipeline connections, injection technology etc.) and emissions therefrom. 
Although the inventory compiler is only responsible for reporting on the effect of operations in its jurisdiction, 
he/she must record cross-border transfers of CO2 for cross-checking and QA/QC purposes (see Section 5.9). 
2. Determine whether an adequate geological site characterization report has been produced for each 
storage site. The site characterization report should identify and characterize potential leakage pathways such as 
faults and pre-existing wells, and quantify the hydrogeological properties of the storage system, particularly with 
respect to CO2 migration. The site characterisation report should include sufficient data to represent such 
features in a geological model of the site and surrounding area. It should also include all the data necessary to 
create a corresponding numerical model of the site and surrounding area for input into an appropriate numerical 
reservoir simulator.  
3. Determine whether the operator has assessed the potential for leakage at the storage site. The operator 
should determine the likely timing, location and flux of any fugitive emissions from the storage reservoir, or 
demonstrate that leakage is not expected to occur. Short-term simulations of CO2 injection should be made, to 
predict the performance of the site from the start of injection until significantly after injection ceases (likely to be 
decades). Long-term simulations should be performed to predict the fate of the CO2 over centuries to millenia. 
Sensitivity analysis should be conducted to assess the range of possible emissions. The models should be used in 
the design of a monitoring programme that will verify whether or not the site is performing as expected. The 
geological model and reservoir model should be updated in future years in the light of any new data and to 
account for any new facilities or operational changes. 
4. Determine whether each site has a suitable monitoring plan. Each site’s monitoring plan should describe 
monitoring activities that are consistent with the leakage assessment and modelling results. Existing technologies 
presented in Annex 1 can measure leaks to the ground surface or seabed. The SRCCS includes detailed 
information on monitoring technologies and approaches (see Annex 1). In summary the monitoring programme 
should include provisions for:  
(i) 
Measurement of background fluxes of CO2 (and if appropriate CH4) at both the storage site and 
any likely emission points outside the storage site. Geological storage sites may have a natural, 
seasonally variable (ecological and/or industrial) background flux of emissions prior to 
injection. This background flux should not be included in the estimate of annual emissions. See 
Annex 1 for a discussion of potential methods. Isotopic analysis of any background fluxes of 
CO2 is recommended, as this is likely to help distinguish between natural and injected CO2. 
(ii) 
Continuous measurement of the mass of CO2 injected at each well throughout the injection 
period, see Section 5.5 above. 
(iii) 
Monitoring to determine any CO2 emissions from the injection system. 
(iv) 
Monitoring to determine any CO2 (and if appropriate CH4) fluxes through the seabed or ground 
surface, including where appropriate through wells and water sources such as springs. Periodic 
investigations of the entire site, and any additional area below which monitoring and modelling 
suggests CO2 is distributed, should be made to detect any unpredicted leaks. 
(v) 
Post-injection Monitoring: The plan should provide for monitoring of the site after the 
injection phase. The post-injection phase of monitoring should take account of the results of 
Volume 2: Energy  
5.16 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
the forward modelling of CO2 distribution to ensure that monitoring equipment is deployed at 
appropriate places and appropriate times. Once the CO2 approaches its predicted long-term 
distribution within the reservoir and there is agreement between the models of CO2 distribution 
and measurements made in accordance with the monitoring plan, it may be appropriate to 
decrease the frequency of (or discontinue) monitoring. Monitoring may need to be resumed if 
the storage site is affected by unexpected events, for example seismic events. 
(vi) 
Incorporating improvements in monitoring techniques/technologies over time. 
(vii) 
Periodic verification of emissions estimates. The necessary periodicity is a function of project 
design, implementation and early determination of risk potential. During the injection period, 
verification at least every five years or after significant change in site operation is suggested.  
Continuous monitoring of the injection pressure and periodic monitoring of the distribution of CO2 in the 
subsurface would be useful as part of the monitoring plan. Monitoring the injection pressure is necessary to 
control the injection process, e.g. to prevent excess pore fluid pressure building up in the reservoir. It can provide 
valuable information on the reservoir characteristics and early warning of leakage. This is already common 
practice and can be a regulatory requirement for current underground injection operations. Periodically 
monitoring the distribution of CO2 in the subsurface, either directly or remotely would also be useful because it 
can provide evidence of any migration of CO2 out of the storage reservoir and early warning of potential leaks to 
the atmosphere or seabed.  
5. Collect and verify annual emissions from each site: The operators of each storage site should, on an annual 
basis, provide the inventory compiler with annual emissions estimates, which will be made publicly available. 
The emissions recorded from the site and any leaks that may occur inside or outside the site in any year will be 
the emissions as estimated from the modelling (which may be zero), adjusted to take account of the annual 
monitoring results. If a sudden release occurs, e.g. from a well blowout, the amount of CO2 emitted should be 
estimated in the inventory. To simplify accounting for offshore geological storage, leakage to the seabed should 
be considered as emissions to the atmosphere for the purposes of compiling the inventory. In addition to total 
annual emissions, background data should include the total amount of CO2 injected, the source of the injected 
CO2, the cumulative total amount of CO2 stored to date, the technologies used to estimate emissions, and any 
verification procedures undertaken by the site operators in accordance with the monitoring plan as indicated 
under 4(iii) and 4(iv) above. To verify emissions, the inventory compiler should request and review 
documentation of the monitoring data, including the frequency of monitoring, technology detection limits, and 
the share of emissions coming from the various pathways identified in the emission monitoring plan and any 
changes introduced as a result of verification. If a model was used to estimate emissions during years in which 
direct monitoring did not take place, the inventory compiler should compare modelled results against the most 
recent monitoring data. Steps 2, 3, and 4 above should indicate the potential for, and likely timing of future leaks 
and the need for direct monitoring. 
Total national emissions for geological carbon dioxide storage will be the sum of the site-specific emission 
estimates:  
EQUATION 5.1 
TOTAL NATIONAL EMISSIONS 
National Emissions from geological carbon dioxide storage = ∑carbon dioxide storage site 
emissions 
Further guidance on reporting emissions where more than one country is involved in CO2 capture, storage, 
and/or emissions is provided in Section 5.10: Reporting and Documentation. 
5.7.2 
Choice of emission factors and activity data 
Tier 1 or 2 emission factors are not currently available for carbon dioxide storage sites, but may be developed in 
the future (see Section 5.7). However, as part of a Tier 3 emissions estimation process, the inventory compiler 
should collect activity data from the operator on annual and cumulative CO2 stored. These data can be easily 
monitored at the injection wellhead or in adjacent pipework. 
Monitoring in early projects may help obtain useful data that could be used to develop Tier 1 or 2 methodologies 
in the future. Examples of the application of monitoring technologies are provided by the monitoring 
programmes at the enhanced oil recovery projects at Rangely in Colorado, USA (Klusman, 2003a, b, c) 
Weyburn in Saskatchewan, Canada (Wilson and Monea, 2005), and the Sleipner CO2 storage project, North Sea 
(Arts et al., 2003; also see Annex 5.1). None of the other CO2-injection projects around the world have yet 
published the results of systematic monitoring for leaking CO2. 
Chapter 5: Carbon Dioxide Transport, Injection and Geological Storage 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.17 
The Rangely enhanced oil recovery project started injecting CO2 into the Weber Sand Unit oil reservoir in the 
Rangely field in 1986. Cumulative CO2 injection to 2003 was approximately 23 million tonnes. A monitoring 
programme was undertaken (Klusman 2003a, b, c), based on 41 measurement locations scattered across a 78 km2 
site. No pre-injection background measurements were available (which, at a new site, would be determined at 
step 4 (i) in the monitoring plan outlined above). In lieu of a pre-injection baseline, 16 measurement locations in 
a control area outside the field were sampled. The results of the monitoring programme indicate an annual deep-
sourced CO2 emission of less than 3 800 tonnes/yr from the ground surface above the oil field. It is likely that at 
least part, if not all, of this flux is due to the oxidation of deep-sourced methane derived from the oil reservoir or 
overlying strata, but it is possible that part of it could be fugitive emissions of CO2 injected into the oil reservoir. 
The absence of pre-injection baseline measurements prevents definitive identification of its source. 
CO2 has been injected at the Weyburn oil field (Saskatchewan, Canada) for EOR since September 2000. Soil gas 
sampling, with the primary aims of determining background concentrations and whether there have been any 
leaks of CO2 or associated tracer gases from the reservoir, took place in three periods from July 2001 and 
October 2003. There is no evidence to date for escape of injected CO2. However, further monitoring of soil gases 
is necessary to verify that this remains the case in the future and more detailed work is necessary to understand 
the causes of variation in soil gas contents, and to investigate further possible conduits for gas escape (Wilson 
and Monea 2005). 
The Sleipner CO2 storage site in the North Sea, offshore Norway (Chadwick et al. 2003) has been injecting 
approximately 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year into the Utsira Sand, a saline formation, since 1996. Cumulative 
CO2 injection to 2004 was >7 million tonnes. The distribution of CO2 in the subsurface is being monitored by 
means of repeated 3-D seismic surveys (pre-injection and two repeat surveys are available publicly to date) and, 
latterly, by gravity surveys (only one survey has been acquired to date). The results of the 3D seismic surveys 
indicate no evidence of leakage (Arts et al. 2003).  
Taken together, these studies show that a Tier 3 methodology can be implemented so as to support not only zero 
emissions estimates but also to detect leakage, even at low levels, if it occurs.  
There has been only one large-scale trial of enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) production using CO2 as an 
injectant; the Allison project in the San Juan Basin, USA (Reeves, 2005). There was sufficient information 
derived from the Allison project to indicate that CO2 was sequestered securely in the coal seams. Pressure and 
compositional data from 4 injection wells and 15 production wells indicated no leakage. Some CO2 was 
recovered from the production wells after approximately five years. However, this was expected and, for 
inventory purposes, it would be accounted as an emission (if it was not separated from the produced coalbed 
methane and recycled). No monitoring of the ground surface for CO2 or methane leakage was undertaken. 
5.7.3 
Completeness 
All emissions (CO2 and if relevant, CH4) from all CO2 storage sites should be included in the inventory. In cases 
where CO2 capture occurs in a different country from CO2 storage, arrangements to ensure that there is no 
double accounting of storage should be made between the relevant national inventory compilers. 
The site characterization and monitoring plans should identify possible sources of emissions outside the site (e.g., 
lateral migration, groundwater, etc.). Alternatively, a reactive strategy to locations outside the site could be 
deployed, based on information from inside it. If the emissions are predicted and/or occur outside the country 
where the storage operation (CO2 injection) takes place, arrangements should be made between the relevant 
national inventory compilers to monitor and account these emissions.( see Section 5.10 below). 
Estimates of CO2 dissolved in oil and emitted to the atmosphere as a result of surface processing are covered 
under the methodologies for oil and gas production. The inventory compiler should ensure that information on 
these emissions collected from CO2 storage sites is consistent with estimates under those source categories. 
5.7.4 
Developing a consistent time series  
If the detection capabilities of monitoring equipment improve over time, or if previously unrecorded emissions 
are identified, or if updating of models suggests that unidentified emissions have occurred, and an updated 
monitoring programme corroborates this, appropriate recalculation of emissions will be necessary. This is 
particularly important given the generally low precision associated with current monitoring suites, even using the 
most advanced current technologies. Establishment of the background flux and variability is also critical. For 
dedicated CO2 storage sites, anthropogenic emissions prior to injection and storage will be zero. For some 
enhanced oil recovery operations, there may be anthropogenic emissions prior to conversion to a CO2 storage 
site.  
Volume 2: Energy  
5.18 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.8 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
It is a part of good practice that an uncertainty assessment is included when using Tier 3 methods. Uncertainty in 
the emissions estimates will depend on the precision of the monitoring techniques used to verify and measure 
any emissions and the modelling used to predict leakage from the storage site. The concept of percentage 
uncertainties may not be applicable for this sector and therefore confidence intervals and/or probability curves 
could be given. 
The uncertainty in field measurements is most important and will depend on the sampling density and frequency 
of measurement and can be determined using standard statistical methods.  
An effective reservoir simulation should address the issues of variability and uncertainty in the physical 
characteristics, especially reservoir rock and reservoir fluid properties, because reservoir models are designed to 
predict fluid movements over a long timescale and because geological reservoirs are inherently heterogeneous 
and variable. The uncertainty in estimates derived from modelling will therefore depend on: 
• 
The completeness of the primary data used during the site assessment; 
• 
The correspondence between the geological model and critical aspects of the geology of the site and 
surrounding area, in particular the treatment of possible migration pathways; 
The accuracy of critical data that support the model: 
• 
Its subsequent numerical representation by grid blocks 
• 
Adequate representation of the processes in the physico-chemical numerical and analytical models 
Uncertainty estimates are typically made by varying the model input parameters and undertaking multiple 
simulations to determine the impact on short-term model results and long-term predictions. The uncertainty in 
field measurements will depend on the sampling density and frequency of measurement and can be determined 
using standard statistical methods. Where model estimates and measurements are both available, the best 
estimate of emissions will be made by validating the model, and then estimating emissions with the updated 
model. Multiple realizations using the history-matched model can address uncertainty in these estimates. These 
data may be used to modify original monitoring requirements (e.g. add new locations or technology, increase or 
reduce frequency) and ultimately comprise the basis of an informed decision to decommission the facility. 
5.9 
INVENTORY QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY 
CONTROL (QA/QC) 
QA/QC for the whole CCS system  
CO2 capture should not be reported without linking it to long-term storage.  
A check should be made that the mass of CO2 captured does not exceed the mass of CO2 stored plus the reported 
fugitive emissions in the inventory year (Table 5.4). 
There has been limited experience with CCS to date, but it is expected that experience will increase over the next 
few years. Therefore, it would be good practice to compare monitoring methods and possible leakage scenarios 
between comparable sites internationally. International cooperation will also be advantageous in developing 
monitoring methodologies and technologies.

All data including the site characterization reports, geological models, simulations of CO2 injection, predictive 
modelling of the site, risk assessments, injection plans, licence applications, monitoring strategies and results and 
verification should be retained by the operator and forwarded to the inventory compiler for QA/QC.

The inventory compiler should compare (benchmark) the leak rates of a given storage facility against analogous 
storage sites and explain the reasons for differences in performance.  
Where applicable, the relevant regulatory body can provide verification of emissions estimates and/or the 
monitoring plan described above. If no such body exists, the site operator should at the outset provide the 
inventory compiler with the results of peer review by a competent third party confirming that the geological and 
numerical models are representative, the reservoir simulator is suitable, the modelling realistic and the 
monitoring plan suitable. As they become available, the site operator should compare the results of the 
monitoring programme with the predictive models and adjust models, monitoring programme and/or injection 
strategy appropriately. The site operator should inform the inventory compiler of changes made. 
5.10 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
Guidelines for reporting emissions from geological storage: 
Prior to the start of the geological storage operation, the national inventory compiler where storage takes place 
should obtain and archive the following: 
• 
Report on the methods and results of the site characterization  
• 
Report on the methods and results of modelling 
• 
A description of the proposed monitoring programme including appropriate background measurements 
• 
The year in which CO2 storage began or will begin 
• 
The proposed sources of the CO2 and the infrastructure involved in the whole CCGS chain between source 
and storage reservoir 
The same national inventory compiler should receive annually from each site:  
• 
The mass of CO2 injected during the reporting year 
• 
The mass of CO2 stored during the reporting year 
• 
The cumulative mass of CO2 stored at the site 
• 
The source (s) of the CO2 and the infrastructure involved in the whole CCGS chain between source and 
storage reservoir 
• 
A report detailing the rationale, methodology, monitoring frequency and results of the monitoring 
programme - to include the mass of any fugitive emissions of CO2 and any other greenhouse gases to the 
atmosphere or sea bed from the storage site during the reporting year 
• 
A report on any adjustment of the modelling and forward modelling of the site that was necessary in the 
light of the monitoring results 
• 
The mass of any fugitive emissions of CO2 and any other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere or sea bed 
from the storage site during the reporting year  
• 
Descriptions of the monitoring programmes and monitoring methods used, the monitoring frequency and 
their results 
• 
Results of third party verification of the monitoring programme and methods 
 
There may be additional reporting requirements at the project level where the site is part of an emissions trading 
scheme. 
Reporting of cross-border CCS operations 
CO2 may be captured in one country, Country A, and exported for storage in a different country, Country B. 
Under this scenario, Country A should report the amount of CO2 captured, any emissions from transport and/or 
temporary storage that takes place in Country A, and the amount of CO2 exported to Country B. Country B 
should report the amount of CO2 imported, any emissions from transport and/or temporary storage (that takes 
place in Country B), and any emissions from injection and geological storage sites. 
If CO2 is injected in one country, Country A, and travels from the storage site and leaks in a different country, 
Country B, Country A is responsible for reporting the emissions from the geological storage site. If such leakage 
is anticipated based on site characterization and modelling, Country A should make an arrangement with 
Country B to ensure that appropriate standards for long-term storage and monitoring and/or estimation of 
Chapter 5: Carbon Dioxide Transport, Injection and Geological Storage 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.21 
emissions are applied (relevant regulatory bodies may have existing arrangements to address cross-border issues 
with regard to groundwater protection and/or oil and gas recovery).  
If more than one country utilizes a common storage site, the country where the geological storage takes place is 
responsible for reporting emissions from that site. If the emissions occur outside of that country, they are still 
responsible for reporting those emissions as described above. In the case where a storage site occurs in more than 
one country, the countries concerned should make an arrangement whereby each reports an agreed fraction of the 
total emissions.

Annex 5.1 Summary description of potential monitoring 
technologies for geological CO2 storage sites 
Introduction 
Monitoring of the geological storage of CO2 requires the use of a range of techniques that can define the 
distribution, phase and mass of the injected CO2 anywhere along any path from the injection point in the 
geological storage reservoir to the ground surface or seabed. This will commonly require the application of 
several different techniques concurrently. 
The geology of the storage site and its surrounding area should be characterized to identify features, events and 
processes that could lead to an escape of CO2 from the storage reservoir, and also to model potential CO2 
transport routes and fluxes in case there should be an escape of CO2 from a storage reservoir, as this will not 
necessarily be on the injection site (Figure A1). 
Figure A1 
An illustration of the potential for leakage of CO2 from a geological storage 
reservoir to occur outside the storage site. 
 
If CO2 migrates from a storage reservoir (a) via an undetected fault into porous and permeable reservoir rock (b), 
it may be transported by buoyancy towards the ground surface at point (c). This may result in the emission of 
CO2 at the ground surface several kilometres from the site itself at an unknown time in the future. 
Characterization of the geology of the storage site and surrounding area and numerical modelling of potential 
leakage scenarios and processes can provide the information needed to correctly site surface and subsurface 
monitoring equipment during and after the injection process. 
Tables A5.1 - A5.6 list the more common monitoring techniques and measurement tools that can be used for 
monitoring CO2 in the deep subsurface (here considered to be the zone approximately 200 metres to 5 000 metres 
below the ground surface or sea bed), the shallow subsurface (approximately the top 200 metres below the 
ground surface or sea bed) and the near surface (regions less than 10 metres above and below the ground surface 
or sea bed). 
The techniques that will produce the most accurate results given the circumstances should be used. The 
appropriate techniques will usually be apparent to specialists, but different techniques can also be assessed for 
relative suitability. There are no sharply defined detection limits for most techniques. In the field, their ability to 
measure the distribution, phase and mass of CO2 in a subsurface reservoir will be site-specific. It will be 
determined as much by the geology of the site and surrounding area, and ambient conditions of temperature, 
pressure and water saturation underground as by the theoretical sensitivity of the techniques or measurement 
instruments themselves.  
Chapter 5: Carbon Dioxide Transport, Injection and Geological Storage 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.23 
Similarly, the detection limits of surface monitoring techniques are determined by environmental parameters as 
well as the sensitivity of the monitoring instruments themselves. In near-surface systems on land, CO2 fluxes and 
concentrations are determined by uptake of CO2 by plants during photosynthesis, root respiration, microbial 
respiration in soil, deep outgassing of CO2 and exchange of CO2 between the soil and atmosphere [Oldenburg 
and Unger 2003]. Any outgassing of CO2 from a man-made CO2 storage reservoir needs to be distinguished 
from the variable natural background (Oldenburg and Unger 2003, Klusman 2003a, c). Analysis of stable and 
radiogenic carbon isotope ratios in detected CO2 can help this process. 
Most techniques require calibration or comparison with baseline surveys made before injection starts, e.g. to 
determine background fluxes of CO2. Strategies for monitoring in the deep subsurface have been applied at the 
Weyburn oil field and Sleipner CO2 storage site (Wilson and and Monea 2005, Arts et al. 2003). Interpretation of 
4D seismic surveys has been highly successful in both cases. In the Weyburn field, geochemical information 
obtained from some of the many wells has also proved extremely useful. 
Strategies for monitoring the surface and near-surface onshore have been proposed (Oldenburg and Unger 2003) 
and applied (Klusman 2003a, c; Wilson and Monea 2005). Soil gas surveys and surface gas flux measurements 
have been used. To date there has been no application of shallow subsurface or seabed monitoring specifically 
for CO2 offshore. However, monitoring of natural gas seepage and its effects on the shallow subsurface and 
seabed has been undertaken and considered as an analogue for CO2 seepage [e.g., Schroot and Schüttenhelm 
2003a, b].

Current technology 
status 
Eddy covariance 
technique (Miles, 
Davis and 
Wyngaard 2005). 
Measures CO2 fluxes in air from a 
mathematically-defined footprint upwind of the 
detection equipment. Equipment is mounted on a 
platform or tower. Gas analysis data, usually 
from fixed open- or closed-path infra-red CO2 
detectors, is integrated with wind speed and 
direction to define footprint and calculate flux. 
Realistic flux detectable in a 
biologically active area with 
hourly measurements =  
4.4 x 10-7 kg m-2 s-1 = 13870 t 
km-2/year (Miles, Davis and 
Wyngaard 2005) 
Can only be used onshore. 
Proven technology. Relatively 
cheap. Potential to survey 
relatively large areas to 
determine fluxes and detect 
leaks. Once a leak is detected 
likely to require detailed 
(portable IR CO2 detector or soil 
gas) survey of footprint to 
pinpoint it. 
Several instrument towers may be 
needed to cover a whole site. With 
a detector mounted on a 10 m 
tower a footprint in the order of 
104-106 m2 is likely. Development 
may be desirable to automate 
measurement. Quantitative 
determination of fluxes may be 
limited to regions of flat terrain. 
Deployed by research 
community 
Accumulation 
chambers technique, 
using field IR or lab 
analysis of sampled 
gas to measure flux 
(Klusman 2003). 
Accumulation chambers of known volume are 
placed on the ground and loosely connected to 
the ground surface, e.g. by building up soil 
around them, or placed on collars inserted into 
the ground. Gas in chambers is sampled 
periodically and analysed e.g. by portable IR gas 
detectors, and then returned to chamber to 
monitor build-up over time,. Detects any fluxes 
through the soil. 
Easily capable of detecting 
fluxes of 0.04g CO2 m-2 day-1 
= 14.6 t/km2/year (Klusman 
2003a). Main issue is 
detection of genuine 
underground leak against 
varying biogenic background 
levels (potentially, tracers 
could help with this). Works 
better in winter because the 
seasonal variation in 
biological activity is 
suppressed during winter.  
Technology proven at Rangely 
(Klusman 2003a, b, c). Powerful 
tool when used in combination 
with analysis of other gases and 
stable and radiogenic carbon 
isotope analysis -these help in 
identify the source of the 
collected CO2. Tracer gases 
added to the injected CO2 could 
also help with this – detection of 
fast-moving tracers might 
provide an opportunity to 
intervene in the leakage 
prevention by modifying 
operating parameters (i.e., avoid 
remediation). 
Gaps between sample points allow 
theoretical possibility of 
undetected leaks. In oil and gas 
fields the possibility exists that 
CO2 may be microbially oxidised 
CH4 rather than leaking CO2 from 
a repository.

Groundwater and 
surface water gas 
analysis.  
Samples and measures gas content of groundwater 
and surface water such as springs. Could: 
a) Place a partial vacuum over the liquid and 
extract dissolved gases. Analyse for gases by gas 
chromatography, mass spectrometry etc. 
b) For a fresh sample, analyse for bicarbonate 
content. This is essentially what was done at 
Weyburn in the field and at the well-head 
(Shevalier et al. 2004). As dissolved CO2 and 
bicarbonate contents are linked, then analysis of 
bicarbonate can be directly related to dissolved 
CO2 content (assuming equilibrium conditions).  
Background levels likely to be 
in low ppm range. Detection 
limit for bicarbonate in <2 ppm 
range 
Onshore. Should be used in 
combination with ground to 
atmosphere flux measurements as 
provides an alternative pathway for 
CO2 emissions. Measurement 
techniques well developed and 
relatively straightforward (e.g. 
Evans et al., 2002) but care should 
be taken to account for rapid 
degassing of CO2 from the water 
(Gambardella et al., 2004).

 Long open path infra-red 
laser gas analysis 
Measures absorption by CO2 in air of a 
specific part of the infra-red spectrum 
along the path of a laser beam, and 
thus CO2 levels in air near ground 
level. It is possible to construct a 
tomographic map from the 
measurements but little track record of 
converting this to a flux through the 
ground. 
Needs development but estimate 
potential at ±3% of ambient (c.11 
ppm) or better 
Onshore. Probably has the best near-
term potential to cover several km2 with 
one device, therefore whole fields with a 
few devices. Costs estimated at $1000's 
per unit, therefore potential to survey 
whole fields relatively cheaply. Once a 
leak is detected may require more 
detailed (portable IR CO2 detector or 
soil gas) survey to pinpoint it. 
Technology still under 
development. Measures CO2 
concentration over long path, so 
interpretation of tomography or 
more detailed survey necessary to 
locate leaks precisely. Difficult to 
calculate fluxes or detect low 
level leaks against relatively high 
and varying natural background. 
At demonstration and 
development stage 
Soil gas analysis 
Establishment of the background flux 
from the ground surface and its 
variation is critical. Technique 
measures CO2 levels and fluxes in soil 
using probes, commonly hammered 
into soil to a depth of 50-100 cm but 
can also sample from wells. Sampling 
usually on a grid. Lower part of probe 
or tube inserted in well is perforated 
and soil gas is drawn up for on-site 
analysis using a portable IR laser 
detector or into gas canisters for lab 
analysis. 
Portable infra-red detectors used in 
soil gas surveys can resolve changes in 
CO2 concentration down to at least ± 
1-2 ppm. Absolute values of CO2 in 
soil gas (0.2-4%) are higher than in air, 
but background flux variations are less 
below ground than above so low 
fluxes from underground are easier to 
detect. A range of gases may be 
measured - ratios of other gases and 
isotopes can provide clues to origin of 
CO2.  
Onshore. Technology proven at 
Weyburn and Rangely fields and 
volcanic/geothermal areas. Useful for 
detailed measurements, especially 
around detected low flux leakage points. 
Each measurement may take 
several minutes. Surveying large 
areas accurately is relatively 
costly and time consuming. In oil 
and gas fields the possibility 
exists that CO2 may be 
microbially oxidised CH4 rather 
than leaking CO2 from repository

gas analysis 
Helicopter or aeroplane-mounted open

Brantley and Koepenick (1995) quote 
a ±1 ppm above ambient detection 
limit for the equipment used in 
airborne closed path technique. Less 
information is available on the open 
path technique, though it is likely to be 
±1% or less. 
Onshore. Proven technology for 
detecting methane leaks from pipelines 
and CO2 from very large point sources. 
Possible application for detecting CO2 
leaks from pipelines and infrastructure 
or concentrated leaks from underground. 
Measurements are made a 
minimum of hundred(s) metres 
above ground, and concentrations 
at ground level likely to be much 
higher than minimum detectable 
at these levels. CO2 is heavier 
then air, so will hug the ground
