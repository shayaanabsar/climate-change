Getting Started
The gases covered in the Guidelines are the direct greenhouse gases, carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane  (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), the indirect
greenhouse gases carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) non-
methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), halocarbons (HFCs, PFCs)
sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Halogenated species (i.e.
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydro-chlorofluorocarbon 22 (HCFC-22), the
halons, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) are not included because of
parallel reporting requirements of countries in compliance with commitments
under the Montreal Protocol.
Although estimation methods are not provided, countries are encouraged to
report any emissions or removals for which they have data and which they
consider significant to climate change. Procedures for reporting other gases are
discussed in Volume 1 of the Guidelines, Reporting Instructions.
To estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals you should begin by
developing a plan or strategy. The first step is to identify the range of possible
source and sink activities that exist in your country. Second, you will need to
establish priorities for inventory work based on several considerations. One
consideration is the priorities among various greenhouse gases. The IPCC has
recommended the direct greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, and N2O as having
highest priority. A second consideration is the relative importance of source and
sink activities within the country and the availability of relevant information.
Finally, once initial priorities have been developed, the analyst must identify and
allocate resources to develop the inventory.
A description of greenhouse gas source and sink activities is provided in
Volume I. The IPCC Scientific Assessments of 1990, 1995 and the 1992
Supplement presents the current understanding of the contributions of various
source and sink activities in the global atmospheric balances of CO2, CH4 and
N2O. This information may be used by national experts in prioritising national
inventory efforts. However, the relative importance of source and sink
categories for a specific country may be substantially different than at a global
level.

Review Reporting Instructions
Review the Reporting Instructions (Volume 1 of IPCC Guidelines) so you
know what data are required. Look in detail at Chapter 1:
Understanding the Common Reporting Framework. This discusses standard
definitions of pollutants, units, source/sink categories and time periods.

Identify priority sources/sinks and priority greenhouse gases. Ultimately,
each country should report all important sources and sinks of all
greenhouse gases. However, in practice, countries with little prior
experience, which are getting started on national inventories, may wish
to prioritise the possible gases and sources in terms of relative
importance to global and national totals. Proceeding with highest
priority sources first will reduce the initial burden on national experts
and allow key results to be reported more quickly in international fora.
General priorities for countries preparing inventories are (listed in
order of highest to lowest priority):
•
CO2 from Energy sources
•
CO2 from Land-Use Change
•
CH4 from major source categories: Rice Production; Coal Mining;
Oil and Natural Gas; Enteric Fermentation and Animal Waste;
Landfills and Other Waste, and Biomass Burning
• 
N2O from Agriculture
•
Other greenhouse gases
This Workbook provides simple methods for all of the CO2, CH4 and
N2O, categories listed above to help national experts in the high
priority areas. Countries can modify the suggested priorities based on
the importance of these source and sink activities in their own national
context.

The Workbook contains default methods for the estimation of each of the
main source categories for CO2, CH4, N2O, halocarbons (HFCs, PFCs)
sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and ozone and aerosol precursors. The Reference
Manual contains background information on these methods and more
detailed options. These methods are in various stages of testing and
therefore are associated with different levels of confidence or "quality."
IPCC's default methodology aims to provide the simplest realistic
procedures for countries to use when making greenhouse gas emissions
inventories. Default values are provided for emission factors and (some)
activity data. Because default information is frequently general, and
applicable to all countries of the world, it may not capture the variations in
activities at the regional and national level that may significantly influence

emission levels. The Workbook is nevertheless a starting point for many
countries that are preparing GHG inventories for the first time.
Countries may use more detailed methodologies, emission factors or
activity data where these are compatible with IPCC source categories, and
can be shown to give consistent and accurate results.  Default emission
factors and activity data also provide useful points of comparison for
national assumptions. If a country's data vary significantly from the default
data, the IPCC asks that the difference be explained.

The Workbook
The Workbook is designed to be a working document. You use it as an
integral part of making an inventory of your country's greenhouse gas
emissions and removals. It is divided into six modules, each with its own
icon:
•
Energy
•
Industrial Processes
•
Solvent and Other Product Use
[Solvent and Other Product Use is included in this version of the
Workbook as a placeholder only. No simple estimation methods are
provided for this category.]
•
Agriculture
•
Land-Use Change and Forestry
•
Waste
Within each module a series of emission sources are identified.  Each
emission source contains one (or more) Worksheets. These are blank
forms for making the inventory which you fill in and return to IPCC.
To help you to use the Worksheets, each emission source section also
contains:
•
a brief introduction
•
a survey of data sources
•
an overview of the methodology recommended for the source
•
instructions for completing the Worksheet
If you want to know more about a particular emission source, refer to the
IPCC Greenhouse Gas Inventory Reference Manual.

In every case written documentation should be provided along with
inventory results explaining the sources of any input data which were not
taken from the default data included in the Workbook. For example, energy
related GHG input data includes energy data, conversion factors, emission
factors, production data for products which store carbon and any other
information which might affect the results in the inventory.
Preferably your documentation should cite published reports as the source
of data. Government ministries, institutes or private firms that have
provided data should be identified by a mailing address and a contact
person. See Volume 1: Reporting Instructions for details of documentation
requirements.

For simplicity and clarity, the Workbook deals with calculation of emissions
at a national level, with source categories broken down into relatively few
subcategories. The level of detail in the subcategories is designed to match
the available sources of default input data, carbon contents and other
assumptions. However, as a user of the emissions methodology Guidelines,
you are encouraged to carry out your national inventory at as fine a level of
detail as possible. If your country has more detailed information on any of
the source categories than that used in constructing the default values in
this Workbook, you are encouraged to use it.
There are two ways in which this is possible:
•
Finer geographic detail
Experts may find that it is necessary to divide a country into different
regions to capture differences between ecosystems and biomass
densities, agricultural practices, rates of burning etc.
•
Finer detail by subcategory
Where data are available, experts may subdivide the categories of
activity to reflect important differences in economic activity, ecology
or species, land use or agricultural practices, rate of burning, etc.
Working at a finer level of disaggregation does not change the nature of the
calculations although more locally developed data and assumptions will
generally be required. Use multiple copies of the Worksheets for these
calculations.
If you have calculated greenhouse gas emissions at a finer level of  detail,
you should also aggregate results up to the most detailed level of
information requested by the IPCC Methodology in order to report them.
This allows comparisons to be made among the results from countries
participating in the inventory. You are also encouraged to report at the
underlying level of detail if it is manageable.
Make sure that you report data and assumptions to the IPCC in order to
ensure transparency and replicability of methods. Reporting Instructions
(Volume 1 of the Guidelines) discusses these issues in more detail.
