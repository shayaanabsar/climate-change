IRON & STEEL AND METALLURGICAL COKE 
PRODUCTION 
The production of iron and steel leads to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide 
(N2O). This chapter provides guidance for estimating emissions of CO2 and CH4.1   
The iron and steel industry broadly consists of: 
• 
Primary facilities that produce both iron and steel;  
• 
Secondary steelmaking facilities;  
• 
Iron production facilities; and 
• 
Offsite production of metallurgical coke. 
Figure 4.1 illustrates the main processes for iron and steel production: metallurgical coke production, sinter 
production, pellet production, iron ore processing, iron making, steelmaking, steel casting and very often 
combustion of blast furnace and coke oven gases for other purposes.  The main processes may occur under what 
is referred to as an ‘integrated’ facility and typically include blast furnaces, and basic oxygen steelmaking furnaces 
(BOFs), or in some cases open hearth furnaces (OHFs).  It is also common for parts of the production to be offsite 
under the responsibility of another operator such as an offsite coke production facility.  
In some countries, there will be coke production facilities that are not integrated with iron and steel production 
(i.e., ‘offsite’). This chapter provides guidance for estimating emissions of CO2 and CH4 from all coke production 
to ensure consistency and completeness.  Countries should estimate emissions from onsite and offsite coke 
production separately under higher tiers as the by-products of onsite coke production (e.g., coke oven gas, coke 
breeze, etc.) are often used during the production of iron and steel. 
Primary and secondary steel-making: 
Steel production can occur at integrated facilities from iron ore, or at secondary facilities, which produce steel 
mainly from recycled steel scrap. Integrated facilities typically include coke production, blast furnaces, and BOFs, 
or in some cases OHFs. Raw steel is produced using a basic oxygen furnace from pig iron produced by the blast 
furnace and then processed into finished steel products.  Pig iron may also be processed directly into iron products. 
Secondary steelmaking most often occurs in electric arc furnaces (EAFs). In 2003, BOFs accounted for 
approximately 63 percent of world steel production and EAFs approximately accounted for 33 percent; OHF 
production accounted for the remaining 4 percent but is today declining.    
Iron production: 
Iron production can occur onsite at integrated facilities or at separate offsite facilities containing blast furnaces and 
BOFs. In addition to iron production via blast furnace, iron can be produced through a direct reduction process. 
Direct reduction involves the reduction of iron ore to metallic iron in the solid state at process temperatures less 
than 1000°C. 
Metallurgical coke production: 
Metallurgical coke production is considered to be an energy transformation of fossil fuel, and as a result the 
combustion and fugitive emissions from coke production should be reported in the Energy Sector. Methodologies 
for emissions from the combustion of fuels in coke production are included in the Energy volume, section 2.3, 
whilst the methodologies for fugitive emissions (including emissions from flaring of Coke Oven Gas(CGO)) are 
included in the Energy sector, section 4.3. Combustion emissions from coke production are reported in 1A1ci (see 
Volume 2: Energy, table 2.1), whilst fugitive (including flaring) emissions are reported in 1B1cii (see Volume 2: 
Energy, table 4.3.4).  
Emission estimation methodologies for coke production are presented here in Volume 3, however, because the 
activity data used to estimate emissions from energy and non-energy in integrated iron and steel production have 
significant overlap.  
 
 
1  No methodologies are provided for N2O emissions. These emissions are likely to be small, but countries can calculate 
estimates provided they develop country-specific methods based on researched data.

Introduction  
No refinement. 
 
4.2.2 
Methodological issues 
Inventory compilers should ensure that all emissions from coke production are included in their inventories but 
are not double-counted. The section below highlights methodological options and indicates good practice in terms 
of reporting allocations, noting that methodologies are also presented in the Energy sector for combustion 
emissions (Volume 2: Energy, section 2.1) and fugitive emissions (Volume 2: Energy, section 4.3) from coke 
production. 
The coke-making process comprises: (1) coal handling and preparation, including transportation, discharge, 
storage, crushing, bed blending, that in all cases cause dust emissions, but not GHG emissions, and other following 
stages where GHG emissions do occur, which are (2) coke oven battery operations, including coal charging, 
chamber heating and firing , coking, coke pushing and quenching and coke handling (i.e. storing, transporting, 
crushing and screening), and (3) coke oven gas treatment. The term ‘coking’ refers to the Carbonisation process 
that takes place in the ovens which is a thermal distillation process that removes volatile matter from the coking 
coal, in the form of gases or liquids, to produce coke. There are two technological options for coke-making which 
differ primarily in the treatment of coke-making by-products: 
• 
Coke production with by-product recovery where organic liquids, including coal tar and light oil, are 
recovered; 
• 
Coke production without by-product recovery, where all ovens operate under negative pressure and, 
consequently, there are no leakages under normal operating conditions. All the by-products are retained 
and burned, instead of recovered. This process is usually accompanied by heat recovery and, in many 
cases, also the cogeneration of electricity. 
GHG emission sources from metallurgical coke production include:  
• 
Stack emissions which comprise GHG emissions from both the carbonisation (fuel transformation) of the 
coal, and from fuel combustion. These emissions should all be reported in the Energy Sector, in 
Manufacture of Solid Fuels in IPCC category 1.A.1.c. The emission estimation methodology from the 
carbonisation of coal, including emissions from fuel combustion to heat the coke ovens, is presented here 
as there is a significant overlap with the activity data used for iron and steel production. The Energy 
Volume (Chapter 2 Volume 2 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines) also presents an estimation methodology for 
combustion emissions is described in Chapter 2 Volume 2 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines that may be applied 
to the activity data of fuel use to heat the coke ovens; therefore, care must be taken not to duplicate the 
emission estimates from fuel use in coke manufacture, within Energy and Industrial Processes and 
Product Use (IPPU). 
• 
Fugitive emissions, which comprise:  
o 
Diffuse emissions (i.e. not emitted via stacks or vents) that occur during regular or irregular operations, 
originating from the transportation of coke, the use of ascension pipes, coke pushing, quenching and 
leakages in the battery. These diffuse emission sources are inherently difficult to monitor and therefore 
to quantify. CH4 is the only GHG with significant diffuse emissions. These emissions should be 
reported under the Energy Sector, in the Fugitive emissions subsection (IPCC category 1.B.1c), and the 
methodology to estimate them is presented in Chapter 4 Volume 2 of the 2019 Refinement.

Flaring emissions of, inter alia, CO2, CH4 and N2O which occur primarily during emergencies and COG

facilities, COG is usually burned as part of a gas mixture that contains blast furnace gas (BFG) and 
other gases produced, such as converter gas. Where these gases are used for the coke production, these 
emissions should be reported under the Energy Sector: (1) CH4 and N2O in IPCC category 1.B.1c , and 
the methodology to estimate them is presented Section 4.3.2.2 Chapter 4 Volume 2 of the 2019 
Refinement, and (2) CO2 should also be reported under IPCC 1.B.1c category, except for when the

be reported together with direct emissions under the category 1.A.1.c. (Refer to Box 4.0) .

CHOICE OF METHOD: METALLURGICAL COKE 
PRODUCTION – NON FUGITIVE EMISSIONS 
This section outlines three Tiers for calculating CO2 and CH4 emissions from metallurgical coke production. In all 
cases, the methods encompass emissions from carbonisation and fuel combustion. 
The Tier used to estimate emissions will depend on the quantity and quality of data that is available for national 
inventory compilers. The decision tree in Figure 4.6 will help select the Tier to be used to estimate CO2 emissions. 
For CH4 emissions, the decision tree is presented in Figure 4.8a. 
There are two Tier 1 method options to estimate CO2 emissions, depending on the activity data that are available: 
• 
Tier 1 a: Where only metallurgical coke production data are available, the methodology applies a default 
emission factor given in Table 4.1, corresponding to the type of coke production technology. This 
methodology takes into consideration default emission factors derived from stack measurements, 
comprising the emissions from carbonisation (fuel transformation) and combustion, reflecting that there 
is no practical way to measure the two parameters separately. Where this method is applied, the 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.13 
corresponding CO2 fugitive emissions from flaring should be estimated according to the methodology 
described in Section 4.3.2.2 Chapter 4 Volume 2 of the 2019 Refinement (category 1.B.1c). 
• 
Tier 1 b: Where, in addition to data on metallurgical coke production, the country also has data on the 
consumption of metallurgical coal, then it is good practice to use the simplified carbon mass balance 
approach, assuming that all coke oven gas is combusted for coke production. This simple carbon balance 
method encompasses all carbon that may be released via fugitive emissions (including unintended 
releases, flaring) and from the consumption of coke oven by-products. In most countries with coke 
production, the required activity data for this method are readily available from national statistics and/or 
operators, and as this method is associated with lower uncertainty than the Tier 1a approach, it is the 
preferred Tier 1 method where the activity data are available.  
The Tier 2 method to estimate CO2 emissions is based on the carbon mass balance approach, using national 
statistical data on the inputs and outputs of carbonaceous materials to coke production. Where country-specific 
carbon content data derived from national fuel characteristics are available, it is good practice to use them. 
Otherwise, a hybrid methodology2 can be used, selecting the default carbon content data provided in Table 4.3, 
provided that coke production is not a key category, in which case country-specific data are required. 
The Tier 3 method to estimate CO2 emissions requires plant-specific emissions measurement data or modelling 
results, combined with plant-specific activity data and plant-specific carbon content data for the carbon mass 
balance approach, for those sources where measurement data are not available. Where models are used to estimate 
emissions (for example, a model that combines a carbon mass balance with measurements), it is good practice to 
conduct model verification to present evidence to justify that the model outputs reflect the facility performance. 
Further, it is good practice to fully document the data and assumptions applied within the model, the sensitivity of 
the model to key data and assumptions, and the associated uncertainty with modelling results.   
Where stack emission measurements are used, it is good practice for inventory compilers to document the sampling 
protocols and analytical methods applied, and to present supporting information to justify that the measurement 
results reflect plant performance, such as information on the frequency and duration of the measurements, the 
variability of the process and its GHG emissions and whether the plant was operating under normal conditions. 
 
BOX 4.0 (NEW) 
FLARING ACTIVITIES IN METALLURGICAL COKE AND IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTIONS 
Gaseous products from metallurgical coke and iron and steel production are mainly used for the 
generation of heat and electricity, and in some cases as reducing agents. There is a minor proportion 
of the total gas produced, usually less than 5 percent, which is lost from the production stream and 
flared, mainly during emergencies or consumer maintenance.   
Integrated facilities usually flare a mix of the gases produced, including coke oven gas (COG), blast 
furnace gas (BFG) and Linz-Donawitz (converter) Gas (LDG) [also known as basic oxygen furnace 
gas (BOFG)], at the same stacks. This situation represents a challenge for the GHG emissions 
reporting, because: 
• GHG emissions from COG flaring should be reported under the Energy Sector; 
• GHG emissions from BFG and LDG flaring should be reported under IPPU. 
Therefore, in an integrated steelworks, where flares of combined gases are occurred and therefore 
the individual estimates for flaring of COG, BFG and LDG cannot be determined, then it is good 
practice to report all flaring emissions in IPPU to minimise the risk of double-counting, and to apply 
methodologies that minimise the overall uncertainty in the inventory. 
COG has a high energy content and losses to flaring are minimised as a result, to typically less than 
2 percent of COG production.  
BFG is also used widely for heat and power-raising, with flaring activity often determined by gas 
demand on plant, and typically up to 20 percent flared. LDG may be captured and used around the 
facility to meet fuel combustion demand, but is often completely flared and in some cases may be 
directly vented to atmosphere. 
The typical industry flaring rates are: COG 0.3-2 percent; BFG 0.5-20 percent; LDG 5-100 percent.

default carbon content from Table 4.3 could be used. In this case the methodology is a hybrid between Tier 1 and 
Tier 2, and is not appropriate if the metallurgical coke production is a key category. 
For CH4, in Tier 2 methodology inventory compilers can use the amount of coke produced, in combination with 
country specific emission factor. 
 
TIER 3 METHOD 
Unlike the Tier 2 method, Tier 3 uses plant specific data, considering that plants can differ substantially in their 
technology and process conditions.  
Tier 3 comprises two approaches for CO2 and only one for CH4: 
• 
For CO2 and CH4:  
- 
monitoring data or modelling of stack emissions, from both carbonisation and from fuel combustion; 
flaring of COG is excluded, as it is included in Section 4.3. Chapter 4 Volume 2 of the 2019 Refinement 
(category 1.B.1c). 
• 
For CO2: 
- 
the carbon mass balance approach, with plant-specific carbon contents of all the materials used and 
produced. 
If actual measured CO2/CH4 emissions data are available from all the stacks present in all the coke production 
plants in the country, these data could be aggregated and used directly to account for the national emissions from 
metallurgical coke production. The total national emissions will be equal to the sum of emissions reported from 
each facility. It is a good practice to apply QA/QC to the monitoring data, following the recommendations included 
in Volume 1 Chapter 6 of the 2019 Refinement.  
A Tier 3 approach for one or more plants could be combined with lower Tiers approaches for other plants to derive 
a national estimate. In case the plant-specific CO2 emissions data are not available for part or for all sources in the 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions

CHOICE OF METHOD: IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION  
This section outlines three Tiers for calculating CO2 and CH4 emissions and two Tiers N2O emissions from iron 
and steel production.  Decision trees are presented in Figures 4.7, 4.8a, 4.8b and 4.8c.  
Volume3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
  
4.18 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The Tier 1 method is based on national production data and default emission factors. The method derives estimates 
of CO2 emissions based on assumptions regarding the quantity of material inputs to sinter production and to iron 
and steel production, rather than through use of more detailed activity data on process inputs. Therefore, the 
method is associated with higher uncertainties, due to the reliance on these assumptions. Consequently, the Tier 1 
method is only appropriate where sinter production and iron and steel production are not a key category(ies). 
The Tier 2 method to estimate CO2 emissions is based on the carbon mass balance approach, using national 
statistical data on the inputs and outputs of carbonaceous materials. Where country-specific carbon content data 
derived from national fuel characteristics are available, it is good practice to use them. Otherwise, a hybrid 
methodology3 can be used, selecting the default carbon content data provided in Table 4.3, provided that iron and 
steel production is not a key category, in which case country-specific data are required. 
The Tier 3 method is based on the use of stack measurements and/or modelling results: 
Where stack emission measurements are used, it is good practice for inventory compilers to document the sampling 
protocols and analytical methods applied, and to present supporting information to justify that the measurement 
results reflect plant performance, such as information on the frequency and duration of the measurements, the 
variability of the process and its GHG emissions and whether the plant was operating under normal conditions. 
Where models are used to estimate emissions, it is good practice to conduct model verification to present evidence 
to justify that the model outputs reflect the facility performance. Further, it is good practice to fully document the 
data and assumptions applied within the model, the sensitivity of the model to key data and assumptions, and the 
associated uncertainty with modelling results.   
 
METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING CO2 EMISSIONS  
Tier 1 method – production-based emission factors 
The Tier 1 approach for emissions from iron and steel production is to multiply default emission factors by national 
production data, as shown in Equation 4.4. Because emissions per unit of steel production vary widely depending 
on the method of steel production, it is good practice to determine the share of steel produced in different types of 
steelmaking processes, calculate emissions for each process, and then sum the estimates. Equation 4.4 considers 
steel production from BOF, EAF, and Open Hearth Furnaces (OHF). In the event that activity data for steel 
production for each process is not available, default allocation of total national steel production among these three 
steelmaking processes is provided in Table 4.1 in Section 4.2.2.3. 
Equation 4.5 calculates emissions from the blast furnace production of pig iron that is not converted into steel. It 
is preferable to estimate emissions from this production separately because the emission factors for integrated iron 
and steel production (BOF and OHF processes) take into account emissions from both iron production and steel 
production.  
A blast furnace is a closed system into which iron-bearing materials (iron ore lump, sinter and/or pellets), additives 
(slag formers such as limestone) and reducing agents (i.e. coke) are continuously fed from the top of the furnace 
shaft through a charging system that prevents the escape of BFG. A hot air blast, enriched with oxygen and 
auxiliary reducing agents is injected on the tuyere level providing a counter current of reducing gases. The air blast 
reacts with the reducing agents to produce mainly carbon monoxide (CO), which in turn reduces iron oxides to 
metal iron. The liquid iron is collected in the hearth along with the slag and both are cast on a regular basis. The 
liquid iron is transported in torpedo vessels to the steel plant, and the slag is processed to produce aggregate, 
granulate or pellets. The blast furnace gas is collected at the top of the furnace. It is treated and distributed around 
the works to be used as a fuel for heating or for electricity production. The vast majority of GHGs are emitted from 
the blast furnaces’ stove stacks where the combustion gases from the stoves are discharged.  
The objective in oxygen steelmaking is to burn (i.e. oxidise) the undesirable impurities contained in the hot metal 
feedstock. The main elements thus converted into oxides are carbon, silicon, manganese and phosphorus. The 
purpose of this oxidation process is to reduce the carbon content to a specified level (from approximately 4 – 5 
percent to typically 0.01 – 0.4 percent), adjust the contents of desirable foreign elements and to remove undesirable 
impurities to the greatest possible extent, which are oxidised with the subsequent removal of the off-gas or slag. 
During the process, a number of additives are used to adjust steel quality and to form slag. The major emission 
point for GHGs from the BOF is the furnace exhaust gas that is discharged through a stack after gas cleaning. The 
gases produced during oxygen blowing (converter gas) contain large amounts of carbon monoxide. In most 
steelmaking plants, measures have been taken to recover the converter gas and use it as an energy source. The CO-
rich flue-gas can be collected, cleaned and buffered for subsequent use as fuel. The carbon is removed as CO and

CO2 during the oxygen blow. Carbon may also be introduced to a much smaller extent from fluxing materials and 
other process additives that are charged to the furnace.

Equation 4.6 calculates CO2 emissions from production of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) for the Tier 1 method using 
a CO2 emission factor. 
In sinter plants CO2 emissions occur during fuel combustion in burners and as a result of leakages from the feed 
materials, including coke fines and other carbonaceous materials. It is good practice to estimate separately the 
emissions from national sinter production and national pellet production, using Equations 4.7 and 4.8. which 
should be used if the inventory compiler does not have detailed information about the process materials used. If 
the process materials are known, emissions should be calculated using the Tier 2 method. 
Equation 4.8a calculates CO2 emissions from blast furnace gas (BFG) and converter gas (LDG) flaring, considering 
that 20 percent (vol) of the BFG is removed from the production stream and then flared, and that all (100 percent) 
of the LDG is also flared. (see Box 4.0) 
Total emissions are the sum of Equations 4.4 to 4.8 (including the Equation 4.8a).

In an integrated plant, the emissions from the combustion of blast furnace gas, coke oven gas and converter gas to 
produce heat for different needs within the steelworks (rolling mills, hot rolling mill, plate mill, bar mill, cold 
rolling mill, coating, pipe) and to produce electricity at the internal power plant to cover the internal needs should 
be reported under IPPU (see Section 4.2.2.5). The methodology for these estimations is described in Chapter 2 
Volume 2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
 
Tier 2 method 
The Tier 2 method is appropriate where the inventory compiler has access to national data on the use of process 
materials for iron and steel production, sinter production, pellet production and direct reduced iron production. In 
addition, as discussed in Section 4.2.2.5, there are several other process inputs and outputs that could be considered 
under Tier 2. This data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy 
statistics, business or industry trade associations or individual iron and steel companies. The Tier 2 method will 
produce a more accurate estimation compared to the Tier 1 method, as it considers the actual quantity of inputs 
that contribute to CO2 emissions.  
Total emissions are the sum of Equations 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11. for those processes that occur in the country.

Note: Natural Gas has a double role, to provide heat and act as a reducing agent in DRI furnaces. 
If country specific carbon contents for all the input and output materials included in Equations 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 
are not available, default carbon contents from Table 4.3 could be used. In this case, the methodology is a hybrid 
between Tier 1 and Tier 2 and is not appropriate if the iron and steel production is a key category. 
 
Tier 3 method  
Unlike the Tier 2 method, the Tier 3 method uses plant specific data.  The Tier 3 method provides an even more 
accurate estimate of emission than the Tier 2 method because plants can differ substantially in their technology 
and process conditions. If actual measured CO2 emissions data are available from iron and steelmaking facilities, 
these data can be aggregated to account for national CO2 emissions. If facility-specific CO2 emissions data are not 
available, CO2 emissions can be calculated from plant-specific activity data for individual reducing agents, exhaust 
gases, and other process materials and products. The total national emissions will equal the sum of emissions 
reported from each facility. Equations 4.9 through 4.11 describe the parameters that are necessary for an accounting 
of plant-specific emissions using the Tier 3 method and plant-specific activity data at a facility level. Plant-specific 
carbon contents for each material are required for the Tier 3 method. 
 
METHODOLOGY FOR CH4 
When carbon-containing materials are heated in the furnace for sinter production or iron production, the volatiles, 
including methane, are released. With open or semi-covered furnaces, most of the volatiles will burn to CO2 above 
the charge, in the hood and off-gas channels, but some will remain un-reacted as CH4 and non-methane volatile 
organic compounds (NMVOC). The amounts depend on the operation of the furnace. Sprinkle-charging will 
reduce the amounts of CH4 compared to batch-wise charging. Increased temperature in the hood (less false air) 
will reduce the content of CH4 further.  
This section describes a Tier 1 default method and a more advanced Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods for CH4 emissions 
from iron and steel production.  
The Tier 1 method covers CH4 emissions from sinter production and from iron production, multiplying default 
emission factors by national production data. Emissions from flaring are consider negligible, as CH4 in blast 
furnace gas and in converter gas not significant. The guidance in this section does not cover the release of CH4 
from pelletisation, although the associated emissions may be relevant when anthracite is used. CH4 may be emitted 
from steel making processes as well, however those emissions are assumed to be negligible.  
Equation 4.12 calculates CH4 emissions from sinter production, Equation 4.13 from pig iron production and 
Equation 4.14 from direct reduced iron production.  
The total CH4 emissions are the sum of Equations 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.14a, for the processes that occur in the 
country.

In Tier 2 methodology inventory compilers can use the amount of sinter, pig iron from blast furnace and iron from 
direct reduction produced nationally, in combination with the corresponding country specific emission factors. 
The Tier 3 method uses plant specific emissions data from stack emissions monitoring, or modelling results. The 
total national emissions will equal the sum of emissions reported from each facility.  
 
METHODOLOGY FOR N2O 
This section describes a Tier 1 default method and a more advanced Tier 3 plant level method for N2O emissions 
from iron and steel production. There is no Tier 2 method.  
The Tier 1 method covers only N2O emissions from flaring, multiplying default emission factors by national 
production data. The guidance in this section does not cover the release of N2O from other processes, as these 
emissions are assumed to be negligible. 
Equation 4.14b calculates N2O emissions from blast furnace gas (BFG) and converter gas (LDG) flaring, 
considering that 20 percent of the BFG is removed from the production stream and then flared, and that all (100 
percent) of the LDG is also flared (see Box 4.0).

4.2.2.3 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
This section provides default emission factors for CO2 and CH4 to be used in Tier 1a and provides a discussion on 
carbon contents to be used in the carbon balance approach at higher Tiers. 
TIER 1A METHOD 
Carbon dioxide emission factors 
Tables 4.1, 4.1a, 4.1b provide default emission factors for coke, sinter, pellet, iron and steel production from direct 
emission sources. The emission factors for the three steelmaking methods are based on measurements and expert 
judgment using typical practice for the different steel production scenarios.  
  
Table 4.1 includes CO2 emission factors for both coke production technology types, i.e.  with and without by-
product recovery. In the first case, the CO2 EF 0.51 t CO2/t coke was calculated as the mean value from the wide 
range of sources analysed and chosen to be the Tier 1 EF as a conservative factor, not comprising energy saving 
technologies, such as Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ), Coal moisture control etc. If these energy efficiency 
technologies are in use at a country´s coke plants, the inventory compiler may choose a lower EF, e.g. 0.30 t CO2/t 
coke. The wide range for by-product recovery coke plants, whose variability reflects not only different operational 
and maintenance practices, but also, and foremost, the types of fuels used as primary for coke production (including 
different combinations of coal, natural gas, fuel oil, coke oven gas, converter or blast furnace gas and other fuels).

Table 4.1a includes CO2 default emissions factor for sinter production, which represents the mean value based on 
the sources studied and refers to sinter plants which do not use carbonate ores. However, for those sinter plants 
which do use carbonate ores this CO2 EF average can be up to twice as high.  Moreover, this value can also vary 
widely depending on the kind of fuel gases used in the ignition oven.  
For pellet production the scarce set of CO2 EFs reported present a wide range of values. The default EF for Tier1 
approach, included in Table 4.1.A, has been chosen as the maximum value reported. Similarly, for EAFs the CO2 
EF chosen corresponds to the maximum value reported.

from scrap metal, and therefore the EAF emission factor does not account for any  CO2 emissions from blast furnace iron making.  
Therefore is not applicable to EAFs that use pig iron as a raw material. 
2   The emission factors for BOF and OHF steelmaking do include emissions from blast furnace iron production, and are consistent with 
Equation 4.4 
3  The emission factors for BOF represents the mean value of (Blast Furnace + BOF) CO2 emissions across the sources studied.

TIER 1B AND TIER 2 METHODS 
The default carbon contents in Table 4.3 should be used if there is no information on average country specific 
carbon contents. Carbon contents in Table 4.3 are based on expert judgment, complementing those provided in 
Table 1.2 and 1.3 in Chapter 1 Volume 2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. It is a good practice to use country-specific 
values, based on measurements or other well-documented data. The Emission Factor Database (EFDB) provides 
a variety of well-documented emission factors and other parameters that may be better suited to national 
circumstances than the default values, although the responsibility to ensure appropriate application of material 
from the database remains with the inventory compiler. 
 
TIER 3 METHODS 
The Tier 3 method is based on aggregated plant-specific emission estimates or the application of the carbon balance 
approach at the plant specific level. The inventory compiler should ensure that each facility has documented the 
emission factors and carbon contents used, and that these emission factors are representative of the processes and 
materials used at the facility. The Tier 3 method requires carbon contents and production/consumption mass for 
all process materials and off-site transfers such as those listed in Table 4.3. While this Table provides default 
carbon contents, it is good practice under Tier 3 to adjust these values to reflect variations at the plant level. The 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.31 
carbon contents listed in Table 4.3 are only appropriate for the Tier 3 method if plant-specific information indicates 
that they correspond to actual conditions. It is anticipated that for the Tier 3 method the plant-specific data would 
include both carbon content data and production/consumption mass rate data, and that therefore the default values 
in Table 4.3 would not be applied to the Tier 3 method in most instances.

production facilities. These data may be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing 
statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual iron and steel companies. If a country only has

aggregate data available, a weighted factor should be used.  Total crude steel production is defined as the total 
output of usable ingots, continuously-cast semi-finished products, and liquid steel for castings. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 method requires the total amount of iron and steel, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas, and process 
materials such as limestone used for iron and steel production, direct reduced iron production, and sinter production 
in the country, in addition to onsite and offsite production of coke. These data may be available from governmental 
agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, business or industry trade associations, or individual 
iron and steel companies. These amounts can then be multiplied by the appropriate default carbon contents in 
Table 4.3 and summed to determine total CO2 emission from the sector. However, activity data collected at the 
plant-level is preferred (Tier 3).  If this is not a key category and data for total industry-wide reducing agents and 
process materials are not available, emissions can be estimated using the Tier 1 approach.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 method requires collection, compilation, and aggregation of facility-specific measured emissions data 
or facility-specific process material production/consumption mass data and carbon content data. The Tier 3 method 
can be based on a plant-specific mass balance approach (for CO2 emissions) or on plant-specific direct emissions 
monitoring data (for both CO2 and CH4 emissions). In this case, it is a good practice to apply a QA/QC for the 
monitoring data, following the recommendations included in Chapter 6 Volume 1 of the 2019 Refinement.   The 
Tier 3 method also may require activity data to be collected at the plant level and aggregated for the sectors. The 
plant-specific data should preferably be aggregated from data furnished by individual iron and steel and coke 
production companies. The amounts of process materials are more accurately determined in this manner. These 
data may also be available from governmental agencies responsible for manufacturing or energy statistics, or from 
business or industry trade associations. The appropriate amounts can then be multiplied by facility specific carbon 
content data and summed to determine total CO2 emissions from the sectors, and the total emissions will be more 
accurate than when using the Tier 2 method. This approach also allows for additional accuracy by allowing 
individual companies to provide more accurate plant-specific data and/or to use more relevant carbon contents that 
may differ from the default factors used in Tier 2 method. 
4.2.2.5 
COMPLETENESS 
RELATIONSHIP TO THE ENERGY SECTOR 
Iron and steel production consists of many production processes (occurring at different facilities), such as coking, 
sintering, iron-making, blast furnace steelmaking and rolling. These processes are connected to each other with 
the pipeline network which carries by-product gases, such as coke oven gas, blast furnace gas and basic oxygen 
furnace gas. This complexity creates the risk of double counting of emissions or omission of emissions. 
Additionally, when there are many different types of steelworks in a particular country, it may be difficult to 
calculate CO2 emissions for the Energy Sector and the Industrial Processes Sector separately without ambiguities.  
Because of the dominant role of coke, it is important to consider the existence of coke making at a facility and 
define the boundary limits of the carbon balance at an iron and steelmaking facility to assure that CO2 emissions 
are not double-counted. The combustion emissions from fuels obtained directly or indirectly from the feedstock 
for an IPPU process will normally be allocated to the part of the source category in which the process occurs (see 
Box 1.1 Chapter 1 Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines). Following this criterion, the emissions from iron and 
steel production for the case of an integrated iron and steel plant should be reported under IPPU or under Energy, 
as shown in Figure 4.8a. Note in particular: 
• 
The emissions from the combustion of blast furnace gas, coke oven gas and converter gas for sintering in the 
blast furnace and for steel making should be reported under IPPU. 
• 
The emissions from the combustion of blast furnace gas, coke oven gas and converter gas to produce heat for 
different uses within the steelworks (rolling mill, hot rolling mill, plate mill, bar mill, cold rolling mill, 
coating, pipe) should be reported under IPPU. 
• 
The emissions from the combustion of derived gases (including blast furnace gas, coke oven gas and 
converter gas) to produce electricity in an internal power plant should be reported under IPPU 
• 
Consistent with the guidance in Box 1.1. Chapter 1 Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, where the derived 
gases are exported off-site for subsequent combustion at another facility, (for example a nearby brick works 
for heat production or a main electricity producer) then the emissions are reported in the appropriate source 
subcategories (1A2f or 1A1a). 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.33 
• 
The emissions from flaring or venting of gases at coke ovens are allocated to the Energy (Fugitives) section 
4.3.2.2 Chapter 4 Volume 2 of the 2019 Refinement, whilst the emissions from flaring or venting of gases 
elsewhere in the Iron and Steel industry (e.g. blast furnace, sinter plant, basic oxygen furnace) are reported 
under IPPU. 
To avoid double counting and to ensure completeness it is a good practice to cross-check the proper allocation of 
the emissions between the Energy and IPPU sectors, and to document where and how they are reported in the 
inventory. 
 
RELATION TO OTHER METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES  
In the iron and steel industry there has been a global effort to establish a common methodology for the calculation 
of CO2 emissions and the energy intensity of steelworks as well as to conduct continuous data collection with the 
purpose of performance tracking and promoting international cooperation in reducing CO2 emissions. The World 
Steel Association established the first method of this kind in 2007, and since then, has conducted yearly 
confidential CO2 data collection form steelworks across the world. The method was refined further and was 
established as ISO 14404 “Calculation method of carbon dioxide emission intensity from iron and steel production” 
in 2013. This methodology is appropriate for CO2 and energy management in the steel industry, and it is in line 
with national policies of many governments. The calculation method establishes clear boundaries for the collection 
of CO2 emissions data (Reference ISO 14404 “Calculation method of carbon dioxide emission intensity from iron 
and steel production”). The net CO2 emissions and production from a steel plant are calculated using all the 
parameters within the boundaries. The CO2 emission intensity is calculated as the net CO2 emission from the plant 
using the boundaries divided by the amount of crude steel produced by the plant. With this methodology, the CO2 
emission intensity of steel plants is calculated irrespective of the type of process used, products manufactured and 
geographic characteristics. This calculation method only uses primary inputs to the plant and primary outputs from 
the plant that are commonly measured and recorded by the plants; thus, the method requires neither the 
measurement of the specific efficiency of individual equipment or processes nor dedicated measurements of the 
complex flow and recycling of materials and waste heat. In this way, the calculation method ensures its simplicity 
and universal applicability without requiring steel plants to install additional dedicated measuring devices or to 
collect additional dedicated data other than those commonly used for plant management. Although the World Steel 
Association does not recommend using these calculations to determine the benchmark for free allocation under 
emissions trading schemes (because different regions have different energy sources and raw materials available), 
the calculations can be used to compare the performance of steel plants globally and to help plant staff determine 
their own position in energy and CO2 efficiency 
There is a difference between the 2019 Refinement and ISO 14404 “Calculation method of carbon dioxide emission 
intensity from iron and steel production”, dealing with the allocation of CO2 emissions to the IPPU and Energy 
sectors, as in ISO 14404 the emissions from coking, sintering, blast furnacing, direct reduction, coke making 
processes, reheating furnaces and rolling are reported under Energy, and only the emissions from the use of 
limestone and dolomite are reported under IPPU.

4.35 
OTHER FORMS OF CARBON 
Although the dominant means of producing crude iron, or pig iron, is blast furnacing using coke, other forms of 
carbon (e.g., pulverized coal, coal derivatives, recycled plastics or tires, natural gas, or fuel oil) can also be used 
to substitute for some portion of the coke in the blast furnace. In these cases, the materials should be accounted for 
as process sources of carbon in the same manner as coke, and care should be taken to deduct these materials from 
any general energy statistics, if they are included there. Iron can also be produced in other types of iron-making 
processes besides blast furnacing, such as direct reduced iron processes, often using natural gas or coal instead of 
coke, and these carbon sources should be accounted for in the same manner as coke, as they serve the same purpose. 
In most blast furnaces, the iron making process is aided by the use of carbonate fluxes (limestone or dolomite). 
Because these materials are necessary raw materials for the process, they should be accounted for as part of the 
iron and steelmaking inventory. Again, however, care should be taken not to double-count emissions associated 
with limestone and dolomite usage if accounted for separately in the minerals sector. (See Section 2.5, Other 
Process Uses of Carbonates, in this volume.) 
SINTER  
Some integrated facilities also utilize sinter plants to convert iron-bearing fines into an agglomerate (or sinter) 
suitable for use as a raw material in the blast furnace. Typically, coke fines (or coke breeze) are used as a fuel in 
the sintering process and are a source of CO2 and CH4 emissions.  If the coke fines are produced at a coke plant 
within the facility and the CO2 and CH4 emissions are accounted for in the coal entering the facility, or if the coke 
breeze is otherwise accounted for as purchased coke, the CO2 and CH4 emissions from coke used in sintering 
should not be double-counted.  Emissions from sinter production are categorised as IPPU emissions and should be 
reported as such. 
EXHAUST GASES  
It is important to avoid double counting blast-furnace-derived by-product gases such as blast furnace gas, or 
recovered converter off-gas, if they have been accounted for as process emissions. Process emissions should 
include all carbon inputs in the blast furnace, used as the primary reductant. In a typical fully integrated coke, iron 
and steel plant situation, adjustments may need to be made for coke oven by-products and the carbon content of 
shipped steel, which should be clearly mentioned in the description of the sources. In some cases, it may also be 
necessary to make adjustments for blast furnace gas or iron that may be sold or transferred off site. The process 
flow of exhaust gases is clearly illustrated in Figures 4.1-4.5. 
The use of a default emission factor for CO2 emission estimates with Tier 1a for metallurgical coke production 
and Tier 1 for iron and steel production assumes an average mix of fuel between coke oven gas, blast furnace gas 
and, in some cases, converter off-gas. On the other hand, the Tiers based on the carbon balance approach consider 
the actual flow of these gases used and produced. Therefore, the combined use of Tier 1a to estimate CO2 from 
metallurgical coke production and Tier 2 or 3 to estimate CO2 from iron and steel production in integrated plants 
can lead to double counting or underestimation of some of the gases used. Similarly, the combined use of Tier 1 
to estimate CO2 from iron and steel production and Tier 2 or 3 to estimate CO2 from metallurgical coke production 
can lead to double counting or underestimation of some of the gases used. The inventory compiler should take this 
into consideration when choosing the Tiers to estimate CO2 emissions from integrated iron and steel plants. 
ELECTRODE CONSUMPTION  
Electrode consumption amounts to about 3.5 kg/tonne for EAF furnaces. However, depending upon the 
characteristics of the charged materials, some carbon may be added to the EAF (typically about 20 kg/tonne) for 
process control purposes or may be contained in the charged materials themselves as iron substitutes, an 
increasingly more frequent trend. In these cases, CO2 and CH4 emissions from these additional carbon-bearing 
materials should be considered process-related and accounted for in the inventory because their carbon content is 
not as likely to have been accounted for elsewhere in the inventory. In addition, if natural gas is used to enhance 
reactions in an EAF as reducing agent it should be accounted for as a carbon source as all process materials used 
in iron and steel manufacturing are reported as IPPU emissions. 
Some specialty steel production takes place in electric induction furnaces, in which case the charge is 100 percent 
steel scrap and where there are no carbon electrodes. There are no appreciable CO2 or CH4 emissions from this 
steelmaking process. 
OHF PROCESS  
Although the OHF is no longer prevalent, it may be necessary to inventory CO2 and CH4 emissions from this 
steelmaking process in some countries. An open hearth furnace is typically charged with both molten iron and 
scrap as in the case of a BOF, and oxygen is injected into the furnace, but reduction of carbon in the iron and 
melting of the charge also takes place by firing fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas, fuel oil, coal or tar) across the surface 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use   
 
4.36 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
of the raw material bath.  Carbon in the iron may be ignored, as in the case of the BOF, because it has been 
accounted for as a source of carbon for iron-making. However, carbon in the fuels used in the open hearth process 
should be accounted for as IPPU emissions.

PRIMARY ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION 
This sub-chapter 4.4 “Primary Aluminium Production” Chapter 4 Volume 3 of the 2019 Refinement is an update 
of sub-chapter 4.4 Chapter 4 Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and should be used instead of the sub-chapter 
4.4 in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, with two exceptions relating to accounting of CO2 emissions from the primary 
aluminium smelting process: 
• 
Section 4.4.2.1 – ‘Choice of method for CO2 emissions from primary aluminium production’, 
• 
Section 4.4.2.2 – ‘Choice of emission factors for CO2 emissions from primary aluminium production’. 
For these two sections, the existing 2006 IPCC Guidelines should be used. No refinements have been made to 
guidance on CO2 emissions from primary aluminium smelting. 
Updates and new guidance since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines include the following: 
• 
Section 4.4.1 is an updated introduction to GHG emissions from primary aluminium production, including 
alumina refining via alternative Bayer-Sinter and Nepheline technologies. 
• 
Sections 4.4.2.3 to 4.4.2.7 and sections 4.4.3 to 4.4.4 provide new and updated guidance for accounting of 
perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions from the primary aluminium smelting process.  
(i) 
Updated technology classes – addition of ‘PFPBL’, ‘PFPBM’, ‘PFPBMW’ – to replace the ‘CWPB’ 
class in existing 2006 IPCC Guidelines for accounting PFC emissions only. For accounting of CO2 
emissions from primary aluminium smelting, the ‘CWPB’ class should still be used.   
(ii) 
Updated guidance (including updated Tier 1 and Tier 2 default factors and uncertainties) on PFC 
emissions from ‘high voltage anode effects’ (HVAE), previously termed ‘anode effects’ in the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines. This includes new Tier 2b and Tier 3b methods for estimating PFC emissions from 
HVAE, using individual anode effect durations, rather than overall anode effect performance. 
Existing methods based on overall anode effect performance have been relabelled as Tier 2a and Tier 
3a.  
(iii) 
New guidance on PFC emissions from ‘low voltage anode effects’ (LVAE), using either default (Tier 
1) or facility-specific (Tier 3) emission factors. 
(iv) 
New guidance on accounting PFC emissions during cell start-up (CSU) periods. 
(v) 
New guidance on Total PFC emissions, being the sum of HVAE, LVAE and CSU emissions (if 
applicable).  
(vi) 
A new Tier 3DM facility-specific method for total PFC emissions by direct gas measurement.  
(vii) 
Corresponding updates relating to Time-Series Consistency, Uncertainty Assessment and QA/QC 
Reporting and Documentation sections.  
• 
Sections 4.4.5 to 4.4.7 provide new guidance on accounting GHG emissions from alumina production via 
alternative refining processes: ‘Bayer-sintering parallel’ (BSP), ‘Bayer-sintering sequential’ (BSS) and 
‘Nepheline processing’ (NP) processes:  
(i) 
This includes a Tier 1 and facility-specific Tier 3 method to account for CO2 emissions for BSP, BSS 
and NP production routes.  
(ii) 
Note that no new guidance is required for the alumina production via the conventional ‘Bayer’ 
process.

4.4.1 
Introduction to Primary Aluminium 
This section covers emissions from primary aluminium production processes including, alumina refining using the 
Bayer-Sinter and Nepheline alternative refining technology4.  A number of refinements and updates have been 
made to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and are detailed in the following sections.  
Primary aluminium production typically begins with the mining of aluminium-containing ores (bauxites). Most 
bauxite is refined through the Bayer Process, which thermo-chemically extracts aluminium oxide (alumina) from 
the ore. The main sources of greenhouse gas emissions from the Bayer Process are covered by existing guidance 
in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for lime production (Volume 3, Section 2.3) and fossil fuel combustion associated 
with alumina hydrate calcination and heat production for hydrochemical processes (Volume 2: Energy). A small 
proportion of alumina (<3 percent in 2015) is produced from the Bayer-Sinter process or nepheline ore refining 
process using alternative technology. New guidance has been included in this chapter for emissions from sub-
processes related to the Bayer-Sinter process and nepheline ore processes only.  
Alumina is reduced to molten aluminium metal via the electrolytic Hall-Héroult process. In this process, 
electrolytic reduction cells can differ in the form and configuration of the carbon anode and alumina feed system 
and are typically grouped by technology accordingly. In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, four technology types were 
defined, representing the technology in place at the time (percent global production): Centre-Worked Prebake – 
CWPB (82 percent including Point-Fed Prebake, PFPB), Side-Worked Prebake – SWPB (2 percent), Horizontal 
Stud Søderberg – HSS (3 percent) and Vertical Stud Søderberg – VSS (13 percent).  
Since 2006, the technological landscape has changed, a result of the closure of older technology facilities and 
significant investment in new, larger state-of-the-art facilities. Point-Fed Prebake Technology for example has 
increased from <80 percent share of global production in 2006 to >90 percent in 2017 but more significantly, the 
growth in technology without fully automated anode effect intervention strategies for PFC GHG emissions has 
risen from <30 percent of global production in 2006 to >60 percent in 2017. As such, the technology types have 
been redefined as follows: 
(i) 
Legacy Point-Fed Prebake (PFPBL) – older cell designs with line currents of less than 350kA; 
(ii) 
Modern Point-Fed Prebake (PFPBM) – new cell technologies5 that operate at line currents in excess 
of 350kA including: AP3X/AP4X, APXe/AP60, EGA DX and DX+; 
(iii) 
Modern Point-Fed Prebake without fully automated anode effect intervention strategies for PFC 
emissions (PFPBMW) – new cell technologies operating with large cells with line currents often in 
excess of 350kA, with no automatic anode effect intervention capacity (refer to Box 4.1a description) 
or with non-standard HVAE definitions, i.e. where HVAEs are not counted until the cell voltage has 
exceeded the threshold for 15 to as many as 120 seconds (Marks & Nunez 2018b; Wong et al. 2018) 
vs. 3 seconds for the rest of the industry (refer to Box 4.2 for typical definition);

The three new Prebake technology classes – PFPBL, PFPBM and PFPBMW – should be used for accounting of PFC 
emissions from primary aluminium smelting, in place of the previous CWPB class in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
However, for accounting CO2 emissions from primary aluminium smelting, the previous CWPB class should still 
be used.  
 
Although smelting technology has changed somewhat, the most significant process emissions have not. They are:  
(i) 
CO2 emissions from the consumption of carbon anodes in the reaction to convert aluminium oxide 
to aluminium metal (for which no refinements are included in this update for primary aluminium 
smelting);  
(ii) 
Emissions of the PFCs, tetrafluoromethane (CF4) and C2F6 during process upset conditions known 
as ‘anode effects’ (for which refinements for aluminium smelting are included in the following 
sections).  
Also emitted are less significant process emissions: CO, Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Non-Methane Volatile 
Organic Carbon (NMVOC). Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is not emitted during the electrolytic process and is only

FULLY AUTOMATED ANODE EFFECT INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR PFC EMISSIONS 
Many Point-Fed Prebake (PFPB) aluminium smelters employ fully automated control strategies to 
reduce PFC emissions, otherwise known as ‘automatic anode effect intervention or termination’ 
strategies. These are strategies that rapidly terminate high voltage anode effects (HVAE) when they 
are detected, using both: (i) automated up/down movements of carbon anodes and (ii) automated 
feeding of alumina to rapidly increase dissolved alumina levels in the cell; in most cases, no manual 
intervention is required.  
However, these automated strategies are not employed in one technology class – Modern Point-Fed 
Prebake without fully automated anode effect intervention strategies for PFC emissions (PFPBMW) 
– where anode effects are terminated through manual operator intervention, which can result in 
higher PFC emissions. This technology class is also characterised by the use of HVAE definitions 
that differ significantly from that used in the rest of industry (see Box 4.2).

This section includes background and guidance on methods for estimating PFC emissions from different sources

PFC EMISSIONS FROM ALUMINIUM PRODUCTION 
During electrolysis, alumina (Al2O3) is dissolved in a fluoride melt comprising 80 percent by weight cryolite 
(Na3AlF6). Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are formed from the reaction of the carbon anode with the cryolite melt during 
a process upset condition known as an ‘anode effect’ (see Box 4.2). An anode effect occurs when the concentration 
of alumina in the electrolyte is too low to support the standard anode reaction. When the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
were developed, anode effects were characterised by a sudden increase in voltage generally greater than 8V (US 
EPA 2008) for a period of approximately 3 seconds. These anode effects are now known as a ‘high voltage anode 
effects’ (HVAE), which release both CF4 and C2F6.

BOX 4.2 (UPDATED) 
HIGH AND LOW VOLTAGE ANODE EFFECT DESCRIPTION 
An anode effect is a process upset condition where an insufficient amount of alumina is dissolved in 
the electrolyte, resulting in the emission of PFC gases. This often causes cell voltage to be elevated 
above the normal operating range. However, PFC gases can also be generated without elevated cell 
voltage. 
A high voltage anode effect (HVAE) is typically identified as an anode effect where the voltage 
exceeds the specific voltage threshold defined at the facility for a specific duration. The typical 
voltage threshold of the industry, and used within this guideline, is 8 volts (Tabereaux 2004; US 
Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 2008) while the typical 
duration is 3 seconds (Wong et al. 2015).  
A low voltage anode effect (LVAE) is typically identified as emission of PFC gases in cases where 
the cell voltage does not exceed the voltage threshold. 
Since the late 2000s, driven by the development of more productive, high-amperage cell technology with many 
large anodes, ‘low voltage anode effect’ (LVAE) emissions of CF4 have been identified.  These LVAE emissions 
have been the focus of much research and occur as result of the same process upset condition as HVAE emissions 
but often at a smaller, localised scale. Guidance on estimating LVAE C2F6 emissions has not been provided here 
as C2F6 concentrations from LVAE are most of the time undetectable (within the noise level of the measuring 
instrument) or at low ppb levels. During LVAE, the cell voltage typically remains below the formation voltage of 
C2F6. Some research (Asheim et al. 2014; Dion et al. 2016) has even concluded that formation of C2F6 from LVAE 
does not occur, or occurs at levels so low, it is considered negligible.  
LVAE emissions have not been included in national GHG inventories to date because the information and 
methodology for their estimation was not available, but estimates should now be included to ensure GHG 
inventories are as complete as possible.  
 
CHOICE OF METHODOLOGIES FOR PFCS 
It is good practice to estimate and report Total PFC emissions, i.e. the sum of HVAE and LVAE emissions 
combined. The decision trees shown in Figures 4.12 and 4.12a describe good practice in choosing the PFC 
inventory methodology appropriate for national circumstances for HVAE and LVAE, respectively. Table 4.14a 
provides a summary of all methods in this guidance for estimating PFC emissions at Tiers 1 to 3. Note that the 
methodologies for HVAE and LVAE are presented separately to allow for different Tiers to be adopted for each 
element if necessary. 
All inventory compilers in countries with aluminium production should be able to implement at least the Tier 1 
method and thereby ensure completeness of reporting. Although this chapter presents default emission factors, 
countries should make every effort to use higher Tier methods because emission rates can vary greatly, and the 
uncertainty associated with Tier 1 factors is very high.  Most aluminium smelters routinely collect the process data 
needed for calculation of Tier 2 emissions factors. The sole exception is facilities with PFPBMW technology, whose 
process data (specifically, accounting of HVAEs) is not currently compatible with the Tier 2 emission factors 
presented here. For these smelters, it is still possible to implement Tier 3 methods – for example, production-based 
emission factors (for HVAE and LVAE emission sources, or total PFC emissions) or direct PFC gas measurements 
(Tier 3DM). Furthermore, use of Tier 3 methods for HVAE emissions (based on HVAE performance) is also 
possible for PFPBMW facilities, provided conventional definitions of HVAEs (refer to Box 4.2) are adopted.  
For HVAE emissions, the Tier 1 method is based on aluminium production, while the Tier 2 (2a and 2b) and Tier 
3 (3aHVAE and 3bHVAE) methods are based on plant-specific process data for HVAEs, which are regularly collected 
by smelters. In choosing a method for estimating PFCs, it should be noted that the uncertainty associated with 
higher tier methodologies is generally significantly lower than that for Tier 1, and therefore it is generally good 
practice to use Tier 2 and Tier 3 methodologies if this is a key category. There is an exception for countries where 
the prevailing technology is PFPBMW, whose current definitions (and therefore accounting) of HVAEs are not 
compatible with the Tier 2a, 2b, 3aHVAE, or 3bHVAE methods in this guidance. In these cases, the Tier 1 method is 
acceptable for estimating emissions from HVAE even if the source is key, although use of Tier 3 methods (e.g. 
production-based facility-specific factors, or direct measurement Tier 3DM) will significantly reduce uncertainty. 
The Tier 3 methodologies for HVAE PFC emissions should be utilized with coefficients calculated from 
measurement data obtained using good measurement practices (US Environmental Protection Agency & 
International Aluminium Institute 2008). Communication with primary aluminium producers will determine the 
availability of process data, which, dictates the method used to calculate emissions. Plants other than PFPBMW 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use   
 
4.42 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
routinely measure HVAE performance as ‘anode effect minutes per cell-day’. HVAE PFC emissions are directly 
related to anode effect performance via a coefficient specific to technology or plant.  
In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, two methods for calculating coefficients for HVAE PFCs were outlined: slope and 
overvoltage. The overvoltage method is not widely used anymore so this update will focus on the slope method 
only. If the overvoltage method is still used, it should be adopted at the Tier 3 level only. If Tier 3 is not possible 
then it is good practice is to adopt the Tier 2a slope method.  
For LVAE emissions, a Tier 1 method and two Tier 3 methods are provided. The Tier 1 method calculates PFC 
emissions by multiplying technology-specific default emission factors by aluminium production. The first Tier 3 
method calculates PFCs by multiplying a facility-specific factor (ratio of LVAE to HVAE emissions, based on 
prior measurements) by the HVAE emissions (Marks & Nunez 2018b). This takes into account plant-specific 
performance at the HVAE level. The second Tier 3 method for LVAE uses a facility-specific, production-based 
emission factor for LVAE emissions. There is currently no generally recognised means to calculate LVAE CF4 
emissions from the process control data that is normally recorded during primary aluminium production. The most 
accurate approach to date is to directly measure both LVAE and HVAE PFC emissions at the individual facility 
level (Tier 3DM methodology for total PFC emissions), but this is not widely or regularly practiced by industry. 
Moreover, there is currently no official methodology to standardise the measurement of LVAE PFC emissions. 
Until an official methodology is released, the ‘Protocol for Measurement of CF4 and Hexafluoroethane (C2F6) 
Emissions from Primary Aluminium Production’ ((US Environmental Protection Agency & International 
Aluminium Institute 2008) can be used as guidance for total emissions measurement. It should be noted that there 
is ongoing work within industry to provide an updated measurement protocol. The LVAE methodologies proposed 
here provide a first step towards total emissions reporting but inventory compilers should be aware of the very 
high level of uncertainty that accompanies these estimates and that work is ongoing within the aluminium industry 
to provide good practice guidelines to complement these methodologies. It is good practice to check the EFDB as 
a source for future LVAE factors. 
PFC emissions can also occur during cell start-up (CSU) – refer to Box 4.3 for a description. If they are not already 
included in normal HVAE and LVAE accounting, then HVAE emissions during cell start-up can be estimated via 
a Tier 2 approach (2bHVAE methodology, based on individual anode effect durations) or a Tier 3 approach using 
facility-specific emission factors or coefficients (Tier 3aHVAE, 3bHVAE or 3CSU). 
For all facilities, the Tier 3 approach is preferred because plant-specific coefficients will lead to estimates that are 
more accurate. If no PFC measurements have been made to establish a plant-specific coefficient, the Tier 2 method 
can be used until measurements have been made and Tier 3 coefficients are established. Countries can use a 
combination of methodologies depending on the type of data available from individual facilities.  
 
ACCOUNTING FOR ALL SOURCES OF PFC EMISSIONS 
In the following sections, a number of different methodologies with differing levels of uncertainty are proposed to 
estimate PFC emissions. To obtain the total respective emissions of CF4 and C2F6, the various sources of PFC 
should be summed using Equation 4.24a. This equation is applicable for estimating total PFC emissions for all 
Tier methods – the only exception being Tier 3DM direct gas measurement as this already provides total PFC 
emissions from all sources.

Notes: 
a The slope method is where HVAE emissions are estimated based on overall anode effect performance.  
b Non-linear methods refer to the Tier 2b or 3b (Marks & Nunez 2018a) and (Dion et al. 2018a) methods, where HVAE emissions are 
estimated based on individual anode effect measurement. 
c Tier 2b methods for HVAE emissions are only applicable for PFPBM, PFPBL and SWPB technologies; alternative methods should be 
used for VSS, HSS and PFPBMW technologies. 
d The Tier 2a/3a and 2b/3b methods for HVAE emissions are not applicable for PFPBMW technology, due to inconsistencies in defining an 
HVAE. However, if consistent definitions (refer to Box 4.2) are adopted, then use of Tier 3a or 3b for PFPBMW technology is possible.  
e The overvoltage method is an alternative to the slope method, where HVAE emissions are estimated based on overall anode effect 
performance; however this method should only be adopted a Tier 3 facility-specific level, since Tier 2 default emission coefficients have 
not been updated here in the 2019 Refinement.  
f Use of the Tier 2a slope method for HVAE emissions during cell start-up (CSU) periods is possible, however, this may lead to 
overestimates of emissions. 
g To use the Tier 3a method for CSU emissions, it is good practice to use individual facility slope or overvoltage coefficients specifically 
for cell start-ups (as opposed to coefficients for normal operations, which may result in overestimates of emissions). 
h The Tier 3DM direct gas measurement method at individual facilities provides emission measurements that are inclusive of HVAE and 
LVAE emissions during normal operations as well as CSU emissions (during cell start-up). 
 
ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM HIGH VOLTAGE ANODE EFFECTS  
Tier 1 method for High Voltage Anode Effect (HVAE) emissions: Use of 
technology-based default emission factors 
The Tier 1HVAE method uses technology-based default emission factors for the main production technology types 
(Legacy PFPB, Modern PFPB, Modern PFPBMW, SWPB, HSS and VSS). PFC emissions can be calculated 
according to Equation 4.25. The level of uncertainty in the Tier 1 method is much greater because individual 
facility anode effect performance, which is the key determinant of anode effects and thus PFC emissions, is not 
directly taken into account. Tier 1 can be consistent with good practice when PFCs from primary aluminium is 
not a key category, when pertinent process data are not available from operating facilities.  
Tier 1 can also be consistent with good practice when the cell technology is PFPBMW as the process data required 
for Tier 2 (e.g. anode effect frequency and duration) is typically not comparable to data for other technologies 
(Marks & Nunez 2018b) and could therefore lead to inaccurate results; however, if facility-specific emission 
factors (e.g. production-based factors to use in Equation 4.25), coefficients or direct measurements (Tier 3DM) are 
available for PFPBMW technology facilities, it is good practice to adopt a Tier 3 method.

Tier 2a and Tier 3a methods for High Voltage Anode Effect (HVAE) emissions: 
Based on overall anode effect performance and slope coefficient 
The Tier 2a and Tier 3a methods estimate HVAE CF4 emissions based on the relationship between anode effect 
emissions and total anode effect minutes per cell-day. The slope coefficient is based on direct measurements of 
PFCs. Tier 2a makes use of average coefficients from measurements at numerous facilities. Tier 3aHVAE is based 
on measurements at the individual facility. Because the process mechanisms that produce PFC emissions during 
HVAE are similar for CF4 and C2F6, the two gases should be considered together when estimating PFC emissions. 
C2F6 emissions are calculated in the HVAE methods described herein as a fraction of CF4 emissions.  
With an established relationship between anode effect process data and PFC emissions, process data collected on 
an on-going basis can be used to calculate PFC emissions in lieu of direct measurement of PFCs. Equation 4.26 
should be used when anode effect minutes per cell day are recorded. For individual high voltage anode effects, the 
reported anode effect duration (AED) is the sum of every second where the measured cell voltage is higher than 
the trigger threshold. The anode effects minutes per cell day (AEM) are calculated based on the sum (in minutes) 
of all the recorded anode effect minutes divided by the product of the number of cells in the considered section 
and the respective time in days (US Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 2008). 
Because PFPBMW smelters currently do not record shorter-duration anode effects that nevertheless can result in 
significant PFC emissions, the Tier 2a and 3aHVAE methods are not recommended for PFPBMW smelters; however, 
if these facilities adopt consistent definitions for HVAEs (refer to Box 4.2), then it is possible to use Tier 3a.   
Slope Coefficient: The coefficient characterises the kg of CF4 per tonne of aluminium produced, divided by anode 
effect minutes per cell-day6. Since PFC emissions are measured per tonne of aluminium produced, it includes the 
effects of cell amperage and current efficiency, the two main factors determining the amount of aluminium 
produced in the cell. Equation 4.26 describes the method for both CF4 and C2F6.

Tier 3a method for High Voltage Anode Effect (HVAE) emissions: Based on 
overall anode effect performance and overvoltage coefficient  
Overvoltage Coefficient: Some process control systems characterize high voltage anode effects by calculating an 
Anode Effect Overvoltage7 (AEO) statistic. AEO is defined as the extra cell voltage above the target operating 
voltage, and this parameter has been shown to be a good predictor of PFC emissions when recorded by the process 
control system.  The AEO process control technology is in use at a few modern smelters. AEO is calculated by 
summing the product of time and voltage above the target operating voltage and dividing this figure by the time 
over which data were collected. As noted above, for years beyond 2019, it is good practice to adopt this overvoltage 
method only at a Tier 3 level; alternatively, if facility-specific overvoltage coefficients are unavailable, it is good 
practice to use the Tier 2a or 3aHVAE slope method.

Tier 2b and Tier 3b method for High Voltage Anode Effect (HVAE) emissions: 
Based on individual anode effect duration 
An alternative way to quantify PFC emissions from HVAE for PFPB technology was proposed by (Marks & 
Nunez 2018a) and by (Dion et al. 2018a). This approach considers that the PFC generation rate is not constant 
throughout the duration of the HVAE but declines as the HVAE continues. Therefore, PFCs are estimated for each 
individual HVAE (based on its duration) and the summation of individual HVAE emissions gives total HVAE 
emissions.  
In general, the Tier 2b method is expected to be more accurate than the Tier 2a method, and the Tier 3bHVAE method 
is similarly expected to be more accurate than the Tier 3aHVAE method. The Tier 2b and 3bHVAE methods are 
considered particularly useful for facilities with a low HVAE frequency or when considerable change in the 
distribution of HVAE duration can be observed (e.g. years when an important relining and start-up of electrolysis 
cells is expected). Both approaches quantify the PFC emissions from individual HVAEs based on process 
parameters that are known or calculated by the cell control system.  
Tier 2b emission rate coefficients (K1, K2 for the Marks & Nunez 2018a method; C1, C2, C3 and C4 for the Dion et 
al. 2018a method) were calculated based on a set of data collected from different facilities. The Tier 3b 
methodology uses the same equations as presented below with facility-specific coefficients, based on the results 
 
7  Computer control systems report either ‘positive’ or ‘algebraic’ overvoltage depending on the version of software used. Use 
of the expression ‘overvoltage’ should not be confused with the classical electrochemical terminology, which usually means 
the extra voltage needed for an electrochemical reaction to occur.

of extensive gas monitoring measurement campaigns. A significant number of individual HVAE, with various 
durations, should be monitored to obtain accurate coefficients. There is currently no measurement protocol 
available to determine Tier 3 coefficients based on individual anode effect measurement but there is ongoing work 
within industry towards publication of an updated protocol.  
The Tier 2b and 3bHVAE methods require extraction and use of performance data for individual HVAEs to calculate 
PFC emissions (an alternative would be for cell control systems to automatically calculate and report total 
emissions from individual HVAEs using the Tier 2b/3bHVAE methods). If HVAE performance data is unavailable, 
an alternative method should be used.   
At the Tier 2b level, the choice of method can be based on the following considerations: 
1. 
Technology Class – The Marks and Nunez approach is applicable for PFPBL and PFPBM technologies; the 
Dion et al. approach is applicable for PFPBM, PFPBL as well as the SWPB technology class. However, 
based on the lowest uncertainties for each technology (refer to Table 4.16b), the Marks and Nunez method 
is recommended for PFPBL technology, whereas the Dion et al. approach is recommended for the PFPBM 
and SWPB technology classes. For all other technology classes, it is good practice to employ facility-
specific Tier 3b coefficients or alternative methods.     
2. 
Distribution of individual HVAE durations (AED) at the facility – The Dion et al. approach is limited to 
AEDs up to 1000 s for estimating CF4 and 150 s for C2F6, whereas the Marks & Nunez approach has the 
advantage of no limitations on AED. Therefore, if a facility has a substantial proportion of HVAEs (e.g. 
more than 5 percent) with AED greater than 150s, it is good practice to use the Marks and Nunez method 
or alternative methods.  
   
Marks & Nunez approach: The approach proposed by (Marks & Nunez 2018a) uses different coefficients 
depending on individual AED, as presented in Equation 4.27a. Note that for the Tier 2b approach, Tier 2b emission 
rate coefficients (K1 and K2) are presented in Table 4.16a; these coefficients apply only to PFPBM and PFPBL 
technologies. For Tier 2, weight fractions of C2F6/CF4 by technology class are given in Table 4.16 (these are the 
same weight fractions as for the Tier 2a method).

ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM LOW VOLTAGE ANODE EFFECTS 9 
Tier 1 method for Low Voltage Anode Effect (LVAE) emissions  
The Tier 1LVAE method uses technology-based default emission factors for the main production technology types 
(PFPBL, PFPBM, SWPB, VSS and HSS). PFC emissions can be estimated according to Equation 4.27c. There is 
no Tier 1LVAE default emissions factor for PFPBMW as an estimate for LVAE emissions is already included in the 
Tier 1HVAE default emissions factor as this value was derived from total PFC measurement data. The level of 
uncertainty in the Tier 1 method is much greater than the level of uncertainty in the Tier 3 methods because 
individual facility operating characteristics are not taken into account. Tier 1 is consistent with good practice when 
PFCs from primary aluminium is not a key category or when smelter specific LVAE emissions data are not 
available from operating facilities.  
 
8 MPDay in Equation 4.27b is the average metal production per cell per day – it can be estimated from potline data or from the 
line amperage and average current efficiency of the potline. Care should be taken not to confuse this with the variable ‘MP’ 
– total metal production from the facility over the accounting period – used in other equations.  
9 C2F6 emissions were not considered in the estimation of LVAE as C2F6 concentrations from LVAE are most of the time 
undetectable. The level of these emissions is in the low ppb and within the noise level of the measuring instrument. Some 
research (Asheim et al. 2014; Dion et al. 2016) has even concluded that formation of C2F6 from LVAE does not occur, or 
occurs at level so low, it is considered negligible.

Tier 3 methods for Low Voltage Anode Effect (LVAE) emissions 
The Tier 3 methods for estimating LVAE emissions multiply facility-specific factors either by (i) metal production 
(Equation 4.27c) or (ii) as a ratio of HVAE emissions (Equation 4.27d). The method based on metal production is 
analogous to the Tier 1 method for LVAE. The method based on ratio of HVAE emissions assumes that HVAE 
emissions reflect the overall performance and process control of the smelter. For both methods, it is good practice 
to define the facility-specific emission factor (LVAE EFCF4), or emission ratio of LVAE to HVAE emissions 
(ER LV CF4) based on direct PFC measurements at the facility. Preliminary testing of both methods produced results 
that were broadly aligned and consistent with the direct measurements of PFCs (Marks & Nunez 2018b).  
A Tier 2 method for LVAE emissions has not been provided, since use of ERLV CF4 emission ratios for different 
technology classes would not reduce uncertainty levels compared to a Tier 1 approach. This is because a Tier 2 
ERLV CF4 emission ratio approach cannot capture all the underlying factors that drive LVAE emissions in one 
smelter versus another of the same technology class. Therefore, this method is only recommended at a Tier 3 
individual facility level.

ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM CELL START-UP 
Tier 2 and 3 methods for Cell Start-Up (CSU) emissions  
For completeness, it is good practice to always include CSU emissions (refer to Box 4.3) in total PFC emissions 
estimates. There are various ways CSU emissions can be included depending on the methodological Tier selected. 
The Tier 1 HVAE and LVAE default emission factors implicitly include CSU emissions; therefore, where the Tier 
1 methods are used, there is no need to estimate CSU emissions separately. The Tier 2a and 2b HVAE methods 
and the Tier 3a and 3bHVAE methods can account for CSU emissions if data on anode effect duration and frequency 
are collected during CSUs and are included in the emissions calculations.  As discussed below, this may lead to a 
slight overestimate of emissions if the Tier 2a or 3a slope factor method is used. Finally, the Tier 3DM direct 
measurement method includes CSU emissions as long as the continuous emissions monitoring occurs during CSU 
periods.

BOX 4.3 (NEW) 
PFC EMISSIONS DURING START-UP OF ELECTROLYSIS CELLS 
New electrolysis cells undergo a ‘start-up’ process prior to normal operation. The ‘start-up’ period 
can vary from one facility to another, e.g. from the first few hours of a cell’s life to a month.   
HVAEs can occur during start-ups of electrolysis cells – from the moment when the anode beam is 
first raised on the cell and metal starts being produced – leading to generation of PFC emissions 
(International Aluminium Institute 2006; Dando et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2008; Dando et al. 2009; 
Maltais et al. 2010). While some researchers (Kristensen et al. 2007; Reny et al. 2016) have shown 
that cell start-ups can be done without HVAE, it is not common practice and PFC emissions from 
cell start-ups may contribute to a significant proportion of a facility’s total PFC emissions during 
certain periods, especially when the aluminium smelter is annually carrying out a large number of 
cell start-ups.  
While some facilities have historically included the start-up period in accounting HVAE emissions, 
others have excluded it given that it does not represent normal operations. It is thought that LVAE 
emissions may also occur during the start-up period.  
Furthermore, new cells following start-up typically operate with a higher cell voltage than during 
normal operation. For this reason, some smelters use a different HVAE detection threshold (e.g. 9.5 
volts instead of 8 volts) for a specific period to reduce the risk of falsely detecting HVAE (Dando et 
al. 2008). This detection threshold is specific to each facility (based on historical data) and should 
be used for calculating HVAE performance at the facility when estimating cell start-up emissions 
using any of the methods described here.  
 
HVAE PFC emissions measured during CSU events have demonstrated lower emission rates than during normal 
operations. For this reason, accounting for these HVAEs using the standard slope or overvoltage coefficient during 
normal operations for the technology class (Tier 2a) or facility (Tier 3a) may lead to an overestimation of these 
PFC emissions (Dando et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2008; Maltais et al. 2010).  
To avoid overestimating emissions from CSUs through use of the Tier 2a or 3aHVAE methods, inventory compilers 
have three options. Lowest uncertainties will be obtained with the second and third options presented below as 
they are based on specific measurements during CSU. However, as a significant amount of CSU measurements 
may prove difficult to acquire, it is good practice to consider the first option when no facility-specific data for cell 
start-up is available. As a first option to take into consideration the different process dynamics of HVAEs during 
the start-up of cells, compilers can use the Tier 2b or 3bHVAE non-linear approach (Equations 4.27a or 4.27b) when 
no facility-specific measurement data for cell start-up is available. LVAE emissions during cell-start-up can then 
be estimated using either a production-based Tier 1 or Tier 3 approach (Equation 4.27c), or Tier 3 ratio of HVAE 
emissions approach (Equation 4.27d).  
As a second option, inventory compilers using the Tier 3a method can avoid overestimates by developing and 
applying slope or overvoltage coefficients specifically for CSUs at the facility (in addition to the coefficients for 
normal operation).  Again, LVAE during start-up emissions may be estimated using a Tier 1 or Tier 3 approach. 
The third alternative, when data is available, compilers may determine a facility-specific Tier 3 emission factor 
based on the total emissions of PFC per cell start-up at the facility. This Tier 3CSU method accounts for both HVAE 
and LVAE emissions during the start-up process, as given in Equation 4.27e:

Note that Equation 4.27e should be used to estimate CSU emissions only if CSU emissions are excluded from 
normal HVAE and LVAE accounting. Care should be taken not to double count CSU emissions if they are already 
included in the normal accounting of HVAE and LVAE emissions.  
 
DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF TOTAL EMISSIONS 
Tier 3DM method for Total PFC emissions: Based on direct gas measurement 
The Tier 3DM method is based on direct measurement of total PFC gases (CF4 and C2F6) at individual facilities, 
rather than estimating emissions through emission factors or coefficients and process data (e.g. anode effect 
minutes per cell-day). As total emissions are measured, there is no need to account for PFCs from high and low 
voltage anode effects (HVAE and LVAE) separately. Furthermore, cell start-up (CSU) emissions are included 
since direct measurements should provide representative coverage of emissions from all operations. The Tier 3DM 
method, following industry best practices, provides the lowest of uncertainty level for all accounting methods, 
since the only sources of uncertainty is related to sampling procedures and measurement error.  
Measurement approaches are only briefly described here. For detailed guidance on direct measurement of PFCs, 
refer to established standard measurement practices and the latest industry protocols (e.g. (US Environmental 
Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 2008)). The inventory compiler should also consult 
guidance on plant-level measurements outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 2, and on QA/QC of measurements in 
Volume 1, Chapter 6. Two approaches for direct PFC measurements are (i) time-integrated measurements and (ii) 
continuous measurements. While neither are routinely carried out by the industry at present, both have the potential 
to provide continuous coverage of total emissions.  
Time-integrated measurements are periodic measurements where PFCs from the facility are collected in sampling 
containers over set time-intervals; gas samples are then analysed ‘off-line’ in a laboratory. Examples of analysis 
techniques include: Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and Fourier Transform Infrared 
Spectrometry (FTIR). Time-integrated measurements are typically simpler and more cost-effective to operate and 
often provide more accurate (with lower limits of detection) than continuous measurement approaches (US 
Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 2008; Fraser et al. 2013). For time-
integrated measurements, it is good practice to provide continuous coverage over time as this ensures 
measurements are representative of all smelter operations. For more details, refer to the latest industry 
measurement protocol for PFC measurements. 
Continuous measurements are those where PFCs are measured continuously by in-situ instruments at the facility. 
These have advantages of: (i) providing continuous coverage of total emissions and (ii) allowing emissions from 
high vs. low voltage anode effects (HVAE and LVAE) to be accounted for separately (US Environmental 
Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 2008). However, this approach can be more cost-intensive 
and may require specialist expertise to operate and maintain. Examples of measurement techniques include: FTIR, 
Mass Spectrometry (MS), Photoacoustic Spectrometry (PAS), Tunable-Diode Laser Absorption Spectrometry 
(TDLAS) and Quantum-Cascade Lasers (QCL) (Aarhaug et al. 2018). For accurate capture of LVAE emission 
components, an important consideration is the detection limit of measuring instrumentation, given that LVAE 
emissions are typically at low concentrations (as low as ppb levels); this introduces a further level of uncertainty 
for continuous measurement approaches. 
To ensure the accuracy of emissions accounting by direct measurement, it is good practice to employ established 
measurement practices and the latest industry protocols (US Environmental Protection Agency & International 
Aluminium Institute 2008). There is ongoing work to develop an updated measurement protocol for total PFC 
emissions (particularly LVAE emissions) to improve consistency and alignment across the industry.

Note:  
a Tier 2 default coefficients are not available for PFPBMW technology class (Modern PFPB without fully automated anode effect 
intervention strategies for PFC emissions) because process data for anode effect frequency and duration was either not available, or, not 
comparable to traditional definitions or thresholds associated with anode effects. 
 
 
Tier 2b: HVAE-PFC emission rate coefficients based on individual anode effect 
durations 
Marks & Nunez approach: The Tier 2b method proposed by (Marks & Nunez 2018a) (Equation 4.27a) uses 
different emission rate coefficients to estimate HVAE-CF4 emissions, based on the anode effect duration (AED) 
of individual high voltage anode effects, as listed below in Table 4.16a.  
For estimation of HVAE-C2F6 emissions, the Tier 2a technology-specific weight fractions of C2F6/CF4 (FC2F6/CF4) 
should be used – refer to Table 4.16.  
 
Dion et al. approach: For the Tier 2b method proposed by (Dion et al. 2018a) to calculate HVAE emissions 
(Equation 4.27b), emission rate coefficients C1, C2, C3 and C4 are defined in Equation 4.27f below for the generic 
smelter, based on the daily metal production per cell.  
 
10  The ‘Overvoltage method’ (Equation 4.27) is no longer widely adopted within the aluminium industry. Therefore, there is 
insufficient data available to update the overvoltage coefficients related to the overvoltage methodology. It is good practice 
to compile PFC inventories using the slope model for recent and future calculations. Tier 3 overvoltage coefficients can still 
be used as they are facility-specific (Dion et al. 2017; Marks & Bayliss 2012).

Uncertainty levels when calculating PFCs from individual HVAE: The uncertainty range of each Tier 2b 
methodology was estimated for SWPB, PFPBM and PFPBL technologies in order to facilitate the choice of one of 
the two methods. These are shown in Table 4.16b.

Note: 
a Uncertainty ranges were evaluated for total emissions across multiple measurement campaigns and facilities (expert opinion). Overall, 
11 measurement campaigns for PFPBM and 10 measurements campaigns with PFPBL or SWPB technology classes were used to estimate 
the uncertainties related to CF4, while 5 measurement campaigns for PFPBM and 4 measurements campaigns with PFPBL or SWPB 
technology classes were used to estimate the uncertainties related to C2F6  . 
b Uncertainty ranges were calculated for HVAE emissions, where HVAEs were within the recommended HVAE duration (AED) limits of 
the (Dion et al. 2018a) method. It is possible that the uncertainty increases if the AED exceeds recommended limits when using the (Dion 
et al. 2018a) method, i.e. 1000 s and 150 s for CF4 and C2F6 estimations, respectively. 
c The uncertainty range calculated in Table 4.16B is based on a comparison with direct measurements and should not be compared to the 
reported Tier 2a uncertainty range from table 4.16 which compares variations of  EF. For comparison, the calculated CF4 uncertainty 
range for Tier 2a based on direct measurements is (-44% / + 388%) for legacy facilities and (-22% / + 256%) for modern facilities. The 
calculated C2F6 uncertainty range for Tier 2a based on direct measurements is (-58% / + 8%) for legacy facilities and (-19% / +97 %) for 
modern facilities. 
 
 
Tier 3: PFC emission factors based on a facility specific relationship between 
HVAE and LVAE performance and PFC emissions 
Tier 3 methods are based on facility-specific coefficients or emission factors to estimate PFCs:  
 
11 MPDay in Equation 4.27g is the average metal production per cell per day – it can be estimated from potline data or from the 
line amperage and average current efficiency of the potline. Care should be taken not to confuse this with the variable ‘MP’ 
– total metal production from the facility over the accounting period – used in other equations.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
For HVAE emissions, Tier 3aHVAE and 3bHVAE coefficients characterize the relationship between facility HVAE 
performance and measured PFC emissions from periodic or continuous measurements that are consistent with 
established measurement practices and latest industry protocols (US Environmental Protection Agency & 
International Aluminium Institute 2008).  
For LVAE emissions, facility-specific Tier 3LVAE LVAE/HVAE emission ratios or LVAE emission factors can be 
established based on direct measurement of HVAE and LVAE for a period of time. There is ongoing work to 
develop an updated measurement protocol for LVAE emissions to improve consistency and alignment across 
the industry.  
For cell start-up (CSU) emissions, Tier 3CSU production-based emission factors can be established based on direct 
measurement of HVAE and LVAE emissions during the start-up of electrolysis cells; alternatively, direct 
measurements can also be used to define Tier 3aHVAE or 3bHVAE and 3LVAE coefficients for emissions estimation 
(described above) specifically for cell start-up periods.   
Tier 3DM is based on direct measurement at facilities, rather than estimation using on emission factors or 
coefficients.  
4.4.2.5 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Production statistics should be available from every facility to enable use of Tier 1 methods for both CO2 and PFC 
emissions. Uncertainty in the tonnages of aluminium produced is likely to be low in most countries. Given the 
expected universal availability of production data, production capacity data should only be used as a check on 
production statistics. 
For CO2 emissions, all aluminium smelters collect data to support Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods. Søderberg smelters 
collect anode paste consumption data while Prebake smelters record baked anode consumption. The Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 methods use the same equation for calculation of CO2 emissions; however, the Tier 3 method uses facility 
specific composition data for anode materials while the Tier 2 method uses industry average anode composition 
data. 
Good practice methods for PFC emissions resulting from high voltage anode effects (HVAE) require accurate 
HVAE minutes per cell day data for all cell types. Annual statistics should be based on the production-weighted 
average of monthly HVAE effect data. The Tier 2aHVAE and Tier 3aHVAE slope method utilizes overall performance 
statistics for HVAE minutes per cell day and aluminium production data and Tier 3aHVAE overvoltage method 
utilizes overall performance statistics for anode effect overvoltage and current efficiency. Similarly, Tier 2bHVAE 
and Tier 3bHVAE utilises data on individual HVAE performance (anode effect duration) and line amperage or daily 
average metal production at each facility.  
Good practice methods for PFC emissions resulting from low voltage anode effects (LVAEs) require accurate 
aluminium production data for Tier 1 (based on production-based, default emission factors) and Tier 3 (based on 
production-based, facility-specific emission factors). For the alternative Tier 3 estimation based on the ratio of 
LVAE/HVAE emissions, good practice methods for HVAE should be adopted as these are used in the calculation 
of LVAE emissions. 
Good practice methods for PFC emissions from cell start-up (CSU) requires the same activity data described above 
for HVAE and LVAE emissions (if using Tiers 2a, 2b, 3aHVAE or 3bHVAE and Tiers 1LVAE or 3LVAE), however with 
a data set specific to cell start-ups. Alternatively, if using Tier 3CSU facility-specific emission factors defined for 
cell start-ups, the only activity data required is the number of cell start-ups over the accounting period.  
The direct measurement method for total PFCs (Tier 3DM) is not based on estimation and no activity data is 
required.  
Individual aluminium companies or industry groups, national aluminium associations or the International 
Aluminium Institute (IAI) should be consulted to ensure that the data are available and in a useable format for 
inventory estimation.  
4.4.2.6 
COMPLETENESS 
Completeness for the aluminium production source category requires reporting of emissions of all GHGs (CO2, 
CF4, and C2F6) from all sources (see Table 4.14) for all aluminium production in all smelters in a country. Primary 
aluminium facilities will generally have good records of tonnes of aluminium produced throughout the entire time 
series covered by the inventory. In addition, carbon consumption data are typically available over the same period. 
Process data on high voltage anode effects may be incomplete over the entire time series and measures may have 
to be employed, such as those described in Section 4.4.2.7, Developing a Consistent Time Series, to calculate PFC 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions  
 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.57 
emissions over some portions of the inventory period. Primary aluminium production also utilizes large amount 
of electricity and care should be exercised to avoid omissions of carbon dioxide associated with electricity input, 
or, to avoid double counting of this carbon dioxide.  
Furthermore, updates here in the 2019 Refinement provide significant advances in completeness, given the 
inclusion of accounting for: (i) PFC emissions from LVAEs from primary aluminium production and (ii) PFC 
emissions from cell start-ups (CSU), both of which were not previously accounted for in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
Despite greater completeness compared to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, a higher level of uncertainty (imprecision) 
overall is introduced in estimating total PFCs, given the higher uncertainties in accounting LVAE emissions. 
Finally, care should be exercised to avoid double counting of PFCs from cell start-ups, if these are already 
accounted for in normal HVAE and LVAE emissions. 
4.4.2.7 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
General guidance on managing time-series consistency is available in Volume 1, Chapter 5; however, the following 
provides guidance specific to aluminium production. 
Time-series consistency for CO2 emissions 
Aluminium production statistics will typically be available for the entire history of the facility. Developing a 
consistent time series for carbon dioxide emissions should not be a problem since most facilities historically have 
measured and recorded anode or paste consumption.  Where historic anode or paste consumption data are missing, 
carbon dioxide emissions can be estimated from aluminium production utilizing the Tier 1 method. 
Time-series consistency for High Voltage Anode Effect (HVAE) PFC emissions 
A complete time series of PFC related activity data such as high voltage anode effect (HVAE) minutes per cell 
day or overvoltage gives the best time series results. Because PFC emissions only became a major focus area in 
the early 1990s for the global aluminium industry, some facilities may have limited information about the required 
anode effect data to implement Tier 2 or Tier 3 PFC inventory practices over the entire time covered by the 
inventory. Substantial errors and discontinuities can be introduced by reverting to Tier 1 methods for PFC 
emissions for years for which activity data are not available. The appropriateness of applying Tier 2 or Tier 3 PFC 
emission factors back in time to a given facility and availability of detailed process data vary with the specific 
conditions. Generally, backcasting of Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods using splicing or surrogate data are preferred over 
use of Tier 1 emission factors. Specifically, where only HVAE frequency data are available and HVAE duration 
data are unavailable, it is good practice to splice or backcast PFC emissions per tonne aluminium based on HVAE 
frequency data (implicitly assuming that anode effect durations did not change).  
When going back in time using the Tier 1 or Tier 2a methodologies, it is important to take into consideration the 
change in emission factors (for Tier 1) and slope coefficients for HVAEs (for Tier 2a). Accordingly, when using 
these methods, it is generally good practice to use the default Tier 1 EFs and default Tier 2a slope coefficients in 
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines prior to 2006. From 2006 through to the median year listed for each cell technology in 
Table 4.16c, default Tier 1 EFs and default Tier 2a slope coefficients can be interpolated from the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines and the 2019 Refinement. After that median year, the default Tier 1 EFs and default Tier 2a slope 
coefficients from the 2019 Refinement should be used. As noted in section 4.4.1, the technology class in the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines that corresponds to the PFPBL and PFPBM technology classes is CWPB. Because there is no 
technology class in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines that corresponds well to the PFPBMW class, inventory compilers 
should use the default EF for PFPBMW from the 2019 Refinement for the entire time series (i.e. from the time the 
PFPBMW technology was first introduced into the country).    
Inventory compilers switching from the Tier 3aHVAE overvoltage methodology to the Tier 3aHVAE slope model 
should use both methods in parallel for a period of three years to evaluate the potential impact. However, 
publications demonstrated that the difference between both methods should be negligible with Tier 3 emission 
factors (Dion et al. 2017; Marks & Bayliss 2012). If the difference between both methods is greater than 5 percent 
over the transition period, then good practices would require contacting the International Aluminum Institute (IAI) 
to be directed to expert advice to determine the optimal course of action for the best representativeness.  
For inventory compilers switching from Tier 2a-3aHVAE (slope/overvoltage) to the Tier 2b-3bHVAE (non-linear) 
methodology to estimate HVAE emissions, it is consistent with good practices to adopt a similar protocol, i.e. 
evaluate both methods in parallel for three years to evaluate impacts and if greater than 5 percent differences are 
noted during the transition period, the IAI can be contacted for expert advice. Backcasting PFC emissions using 
Tier 2b in 2019 and prior years is also possible, provided historical data on individual HVAE durations is still 
available. 
Currently many facilities are making PFC measurements that facilitate implementation of Tier 3 PFC inventory 
methods. There are a number of issues that impact on whether Tier 3 PFC emission factors can be extrapolated to 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use   
 
4.58 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
past inventory periods. Factors that should be considered include: (i) whether any technology upgrades have been 
implemented at the facility, including significant amperage increase, new cell control system, or significant 
changes in alumina feed control strategy affecting the frequency of HVAEs, (ii) whether there have been 
substantial changes in work practices affecting the distribution of the HVAE durations, (iii)_whether any changes 
in the calculation of underlying process data have occurred, and (iv) the quality of the measurements made to 
establish the Tier 3 factor or coefficient. It is good practice to consult with representatives from the operating 
facilities, either directly or through regional or international organizations representing the industry to develop the 
best strategy for the specific group of operating locations included in the national inventory. Additional 
information on splicing methods and details regarding constructing a time series for primary aluminium is 
available in The Aluminium Sector GHG Protocol (International Aluminium Institute 2006). Expert advice is also 
available from global and regional aluminium industry associations regarding greenhouse gas emissions and 
typical industry emissions from aluminium production. 
Table 4.16c has been provided to facilitate the choice of the correct HVAE emission factor (EF) for time consistent 
inventories.

2 For PFPBMW technology, median year is 2011, however use of updated Tier 1 EF is recommended for the entire time series.  
 
Time-series consistency for Low Voltage Anode Effect (LVAE) PFC emissions 
Low voltage anode effects (LVAEs) became a concern for the aluminium industry in the early 2010s, due to an 
increase number of cell technologies with higher amperage and additional anodes (Chen et al. 2013; Wong & 
Marks 2013; Zarouni et al. 2013; Dando et al. 2015; Wong et al. 2015; International Aluminium Institute 2018). 
Actual data indicates that these PFC emissions are greater for specific cell technologies, usually with cell amperage 
higher than 350kA.  Therefore, inventory compilers should backcast the LVAE PFC emissions, for national 
inventories, by using the respective Tier 1 coefficient specific to each category back to 2006. Since 2006, the 
global aluminium industry has undergone changes in technology and operating conditions that make LVAE 
emissions much more prevalent12; these changes have occurred not only through uptake of newer technologies 
(e.g. PFPBL to PFPBM) but also during upgrades within the same technology in order to maximise productivity 
and reduce energy use (Coursol et al. 2011, Kalban et al. 2013, Tarcy et al. 2011). The relative insignificance of 
emissions from LVAE before 2006 is also supported by (i) the lack of industry reports detecting LVAE emissions 
in PFC measurements prior to 2006, (ii) the very high frequencies of HVAEs (and hence high HVAE emissions)  
prior to 2006 outweighing any small contributions of LVAE emissions, and (iii) the agreement in global top-down 
and bottom-up industry estimates of total PFCs prior to 2002 (Wong et al., 2015). Hence, it is not recommended 
to backcast LVAE PFC emissions prior to 2006.  
 
12 The fundamental factors that make LVAE emissions more prevalent in today’s current smelting technologies were less 
significant prior to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (expert judgement). These factors include: higher anode current density (Amps 
per cm2 anode surface) to maximise cell productivity, lower anode-cathode distance to minimise cell voltage and hence 
energy use, larger anode dimensions which reduced the volume of liquid electrolyte to dissolve alumina, greater demand on 
transporting alumina to all anodes per point feeder (for PFPB technologies), and longer cells with significantly more anodes 
increasing the risk of localised issues in cells. These trends in the industry have occurred not only from the uptake of new 
technologies (e.g. from PFPBL to high amperage PFPBM), but also through incremental upgrades within the same technology 
class (e.g. modernising existing PFPBL technology) to enable greater metal productivity and reduced energy use. Examples 
of upgrades within the same technology include Coursol et al. 2011,  Kalban et al. 2013, Tarcy et al. 2011, many of which 
also led to a reduction in HVAE emissions, making LVAE emissions more significant in comparison.

4.59 
If Tier 3 coefficients are available, it is good practice to use these coefficients for past inventory periods instead 
of using Tier 1 coefficients. There are several issues that impact the uncertainty of Tier 3 PFC emission factors 
when extrapolated to past inventory periods. The factors presented in the previous section on high voltage anode 
effects are also applicable when estimating the possibility of extrapolating LVAE estimations outside of the 
measured EF period. It is particularly important to consider any significant change in the alumina feeding strategy 
as it can significantly impact the LVAE emission coefficient. Finally, the study performed by (Dion et al. 2018b) 
highlighted the importance of considering numerous facilities when estimating LVAE emissions using Tier 1 
emission factors. Inventory compilers should therefore be aware of the limitations associated with the Tier 1 
coefficients included in this guidance when applying it to a limited number of smelters, or when used for a single 
facility.   This is driven by the high uncertainty of LVAE PFC emissions from individual smelters and the possible 
variability of these emissions related to different control process parameters between the different facilities. 
Table 4.16d has been provided to facilitate the choice of the correct LVAE emission factor (EF) for time consistent 
inventories. 
 
 
4.4.3 
Uncertainty assessment for primary aluminium 
production 
There are major differences in the uncertainty for PFC emissions depending on the choice of Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 
3 methods. The differences in uncertainty resulting from choice of method for carbon dioxide emissions are much 
smaller than for PFC emissions. There is no basis for country or regional differences in emissions resulting from 
aluminium production other than the differences that result from the specific type of production technologies and 
work practices in use in the country or region. These differences are reflected in the calculation methodologies 
described above. 
4.4.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties for CO2 emissions 
The uncertainty in the emission factors for calculating carbon dioxide emissions from carbon anode or paste 
consumption should be less than ±5 percent for both the Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods, and less than ±10 percent for 
the Tier 1 method. The reactions leading to carbon dioxide emissions are well understood and the emissions are 
very directly connected to the tonnes of aluminium produced through the fundamental electrochemical equations 
for alumina reduction at a carbon anode and oxidation from thermal processes. Both of these fundamental 
processes producing carbon dioxide are included in process parameters routinely monitored at the production 
facilities, the net carbon consumed and/or paste consumption. The main source of uncertainty is in the net carbon 
consumed for Prebake technologies and paste consumption for Søderberg cells. These factors are both carefully 
monitored and are important factors in the economic performance of a facility. Improvements in accuracy of carbon 
dioxide emissions inventories can be achieved by moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2 methods because there is a range 
of performance of reduction facilities in the consumption of carbon anode materials. Less significant

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
improvements in accuracy can be expected in choosing the Tier 3 method over the Tier 2 method. This is because 
the major factors in the calculation are the net anode carbon consumed or paste consumption and the production 
of aluminium. The uncertainty of both these components of the calculation equation is low, 2 to 5 percent, and 
these uncertainties dominate the overall calculation of carbon dioxide emissions in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods. 
Facility specific data are used in both Tier 2 and Tier 3 calculations for these parameters. The Tier 3 method refines 
the calculation to use actual composition of the carbon anode materials. While there can be considerable variability 
in the minor components of the anode materials this variability does not contribute significantly to the overall 
calculation of carbon dioxide emissions. 
Uncertainties for PFC emissions 
In considering changes in uncertainty in PFC emissions inventory when moving from Tier 1 to Tier 2 and Tier 3 
methods, there are major reductions in uncertainty when choosing the Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods over the Tier 1 
method.  
For HVAE emissions, the high level of uncertainty in the Tier 1 method reflects the significant variability in HVAE 
performance from one facility to another within the same technology class. The Tier 1 method is based on using a 
single default coefficient for all operators by technology type. Since there can be variations in anode effect 
performance (frequency and duration) by factors of 10 among operators using the same technology (IAI, 2005c), 
use of the Tier 1 method can result in uncertainties of the same magnitude. There is less impact on uncertainty 
levels in choosing the Tier 3 methods (3aHVAE and 3bHVAE) over the Tier 2 methods (2a and 2b) for estimating 
HVAE. When using the Tier 2a or 2b methods , the level of uncertainty reduction depends on the cell technology 
type. For example, the uncertainty for Tier 2a industry slope coefficients for individual facilities ranges from -27 
to +32 percent for PFPBM, to -53 to +130 percent for VSS. Compared to Tier 2a, the Tier 2 method provides 
significantly lower levels of uncertainty (roughly 3-5 times less, expert opinion) for individual facilities in terms 
of estimated PFC emissions; however again, the level of uncertainty depends on technology type. 
Both Tier 2 (2a and 2b) and Tier 3 (3aHVAE and 3bHVAE) methods are based on direct PFC measurements that 
establish a relationship between HVAE performance and PFC specific emissions. The Tier 2 methods use average 
equation coefficients by technology while the Tier 3aHVAE and 3bHVAE methods uses facility-specific coefficients 
based on direct PFC measurements made at the facility. The lowest uncertainty for PFC emissions calculations 
from HVAE is from the use of the Tier 3bHVAE method, followed by the Tier 3aHVAE method. However, to achieve 
this lower uncertainty in Tier 3 PFC calculations it is important to use good practices in making facility specific 
PFC measurements. These measurement good practices have been established and documented in a protocol 
available globally (US Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 2008); it is good 
practice to check for updates to these protocols. When properly established these Tier 3 coefficients will have an 
uncertainty of +/-15 percent at the time the coefficients are measured. 
For LVAE emissions, there is a high level of uncertainty associated with emission estimates using Tier 1. The Tier 
3LVAE method has a much lower uncertainty than Tier 1 as it is facility specific and based on a period of direct 
measurement at the site. LVAE is a relatively new discovery in the aluminium industry and as such, research 
continues on the best predictors and models to use to estimate LVAE emissions. There is also high variability 
observed between different facilities which results in large uncertainty ranges for the measured data that underpins 
the emissions factors. A measurement protocol for LVAE measurements to support the Tier 3LVAE methodology  
is still under development and it is expected that such industry guidance to align measurement procedures and 
processes will improve consistency across the industry. Furthermore, considering the typically low concentrations 
of LVAE emissions and the detection limits of measuring instruments, it is expected that the uncertainty of the  
Tier 3LVAE method for LVAE emissions will be larger than that fore Tier 3 methods (3aHVAE and 3bHVAE) to estimate 
HVAE emissions. Finally, while Tier 3LVAE provides the lower uncertainty for LVAE estimations than Tier 1, the 
lowest overall uncertainty for total PFC emissions is from the Tier 3DM method, i.e. direct measurement of total 
PFCs. 
For CSU emissions, there is no specific methodology at the Tier 1 level, since CSU emissions are implicitly 
included in Tier 1 methods for estimating HVAE and LVAE emissions. However, given the wide variation in cell 
technologies and start-up operating practices from one facility to another, a higher level of uncertainty is expected 
at Tier 1 (as discussed previously for HVAE and LVAE emissions). If CSU emissions are accounted for separately, 
use of the Tier 2b method is likely to provide lower uncertainties compared to the Tier 2a method (with standard 
slope coefficients, which  may overestimate HVAE emissions). Similarly, when facility-specific at Tier 3 
coefficients are available, use of the Tier 3bHVAE method is expected to provide lower levels of uncertainty than 
the Tier 3aHVAE method. However, lowest uncertainties can be obtained through use of one of the following: (a) 
Tier 3aHVAE or Tier 3bHVAE emission coefficients for HVAE emissions, combined with Tier 3LVAE coefficients 
determined specifically for CSU periods, or (b) use of Tier 3CSU total emission factors determined specifically for 
CSU periods.

4.61 
Finally, the Tier 3DM direct measurement method, following industry best practices, provides the lowest of 
uncertainty level for all accounting methods for all PFC emissions (HVAE, LVAE and CSU), since the only 
sources of uncertainty is related to sampling procedures and measurement error. 
4.4.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
There is very little uncertainty in the data for the annual production of aluminium, less than 1 percent. The 
uncertainty in recording carbon consumption as baked anode consumption or coke and paste consumption is 
estimated to be only slightly higher than for aluminium production, less than 2 percent. For HVAE PFC emissions, 
the other component of calculated facility specific emissions using Tier 2a or Tier 3aHVAE methods is the overall 
anode effect activity data, i.e.: anode effect minutes (AEM) per cell day for the slope method, or anode effect 
overvoltage (AEO) for overvoltage method. These parameters are typically logged by the process control system 
as part of the operations of nearly all aluminium production facilities and the uncertainties in these data are low. It 
also applies to the Tier 2b and 3bHVAE approach where potline current and AED for individual HVAEs are precisely 
monitored by the cell control system; the only exception are cases where this individual AED data is automatically 
consolidated into overall anode effect performance statistics by the facility’s software on a daily basis, or for 
different periods, which prevents the use of this method. Further activity data required for Tier 2b or 3bHVAE method 
(Dion et al. approach) is the average daily metal production per cell, which has very little uncertainty in the data, 
less than 5 percent. For estimation of CSU emissions using the Tier 3CSU method, there is very little uncertainty on 
the recorded number of cell start-ups (NCSU) per accounting period, less than 2 percent.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) 
Reporting and Documentation for primary 
aluminium production 
4.4.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice at all primary aluminium production facilities to maintain records of all of the necessary activity 
data to support calculations of emissions factors as suggested in these guidelines. These records will include 
production of aluminium, anode effect performance and consumption of carbon materials used in either Prebake 
or Søderberg cells. In addition, the International Aluminium Institute maintains global summaries of aggregated 
activity data for these same parameters and regional data are available from regional aluminium associations. It is 
good practice to aggregate emissions estimates from each smelter to estimate total national emissions. However, 
if smelter-level production data are unavailable, smelter capacity data may be used along with aggregate national 
production to estimate smelter production.  
It is good practice to verify facility CO2 emission factors per tonne aluminium by comparison with the expected 
range of variation that would be predicted from the variation noted in Tables 4.10 and 4.11 for carbon dioxide 
specific emissions. Also, the underlying equation coefficients used for calculating PFC emission factors per tonne 
aluminium should be compared with those noted. It is suggested that any inventory value outside the 95 percent 
confidence range of the data population variance be confirmed with the data source.  
Use of standard measurement methods improves the consistency of the resulting data and knowledge of the 
statistical properties of the data. For HVAE emissions from primary aluminium, the ‘EPA/IAI Protocol for 
Measurement of Tetrafluoromethane (CF4) and Hexafluoroethane (C2F6) Emissions from Primary Aluminum 
Production’ is the internationally recognized standard (US Environmental Protection Agency & International 
Aluminium Institute 2008). Significant differences between calculated Tier 3aHVAE or 3bHVAE coefficients based 
on PFC measurements and the respective industry average Tier 2a or 2b coefficients for similar reduction 
technology should elicit further review and checks on calculations. Large differences should be explained and 
documented. The International Aluminium Institute (IAI) collects anode effect performance data from a number 
of smelters and can be consulted for assistance in identifying outlier data. . In addition, an up-to-date database of 
PFC measurements is also maintained by IAI and should be consulted when assessing the appropriateness of 
reported data. For LVAE emissions measurements which are relatively new and as yet, not widely measured, 
protocols are under development to improve consistency and alignment across the industry. Industry associations 
such as the IAI can be consulted for the latest developments.  
Inter-annual changes in emissions of carbon dioxide per tonne aluminium should not exceed +/-10 percent based 
on the consistency of the underlying processes that produce carbon dioxide. In contrast, inter-annual changes in 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use   
 
4.62 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
emissions of PFCs13 per tonne of aluminium may change by values of up to +/- 100 percent. Increases in PFC 
specific emissions can result from process instability. Increases in anode effect frequency and duration can be the 
result of factors such as unanticipated power interruptions, changes in sources of alumina feed materials, cell 
operational problems, and increases in potline amperage to increase aluminium production. Decreases in PFC 
specific emissions can result from decreases in anode effect frequency and duration due to changes in the computer 
algorithms used in cell process control, upgrades in cell technology such as the installation of point feeders, 
improved work practices and better control of raw materials.  
4.4.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Internal Documentation and 
Archiving. Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are provided 
below.  
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. To improve transparency, it is good practice to report 
emissions for PFCs from aluminium production separately from other source categories. Additionally, it is good 
practice that CF4 and C2F6 emissions are reported separately on a mass basis.  
The supporting information necessary to ensure transparency in reported emissions estimates is shown in Table 
4.17, good practice Reporting Information for PFC Emissions from Aluminium Production by Tier, below.  
Much of the production and process data are considered proprietary by operators, especially where there is only 
one smelter in a country. It is good practice to exercise appropriate techniques, including aggregation of data, to 
ensure protection of confidential data.

Methodological issues for alumina production 
This guidance does not consider any new methodological issues associated with GHG emission inventories for the 
production of alumina from the conventional Bayer process. Emissions from the Bayer process are covered by 
existing guidance for fossil fuel combustion (Volume 2, Chapter 2) and for lime production (Volume 3, Section 
2.3).  
Methodological issues for alumina production from Bayer-sintering parallel (BSP), Bayer-sintering sequential 
(BSS) and Nepheline processing (NP) only are considered in this section (see Figure 4.12b). In 2017, only around 
3 percent of alumina was produced globally via the Bayer-sintering process and around 1 percent via the Nepheline 
processing mainly in 3 countries – Russia, Kazakhstan and China. 
4.4.5.1 
ALTERNATIVE ALUMINA REFINING PROCESSES 
BAYER-SINTERING PROCESS 
The Bayer-sintering process is an alternative process to the more conventional Bayer process and is used when the 
bauxite feed has a high silica content making processing by the conventional Bayer process uneconomical due to 
high soda and alumina loss. The Bayer-sinter process involves a sintering stage (either with soda or with soda and 
limestone) that produces a solid sodium aluminate sinter which is then leached to form the sodium aluminate liquor 
(green liquor).  
The process to produce green liquor is an alternative process to bauxite digestion which takes place in the 
conventional Bayer process. Green liquors from both Bayer and sintering branches of the process are cooled and 
held in precipitator vessels which results in the precipitation of alumina hydrate that is filtered and washed.  
The alumina hydrate is then passed through a rotary or stationary calciner at 1100°C to drive off the chemically 
combined water. The result is a white powder, pure calcined or ‘metallurgical’ grade alumina (Al2O3), which is 
the basic raw material for primary aluminium production. 
Depending on bauxite quality there two variations of the Bayer-sintering process: parallel and sequential. In the 
case of the parallel process (BSP), a proportion of the bauxite feed (up to 20-30 percent) is processed in the 
sintering branch and the rest is effectively processed by the conventional Bayer process (Figure 4.12b). In the case 
of sequential process (BSS), all bauxite is Bayer digested and red mud is mixed with soda and limestone and fed 
to the sintering operation to recover soda and alumina from it. 
The main sources of the greenhouse gases emissions of CO2, N2O and CH4 from the Bayer-sintering process are 
listed below, of which, the sintering step is the main focus of this section: 
• 
Sintering (fuel combustion14 and carbonates decomposition15);  
• 
Power and heat production facilities (fuel combustion1); 
• 
Alumina hydrate calcination (fuel combustion1); 
• 
Lime calcination (fuel combustion and carbonates decomposition16). 
 
 
 
 
 
14 Calculation of GHG emissions shall be done in accordance to Volume 2 Energy, Chapter 2 Stationary Combustion for Fuel 
Burning. 
15 Emissions from carbonate decomposition shall be calculated in accordance to Section 4.4.5.2 of current chapter. 
16 Calculation of GHG emissions shall be done in accordance to Volume 3 Industrial Processes and Product Use, Chapter 2 
Mineral Industry Emissions, Section 2.3 Lime Production.

NEPHELINE PROCESS 
The Nepheline process (NP) is another alternative route for alumina production (<1 percent of global production17 
in 2017), which uses nepheline as the raw material as opposed to bauxite in the conventional Bayer process. 
Nepheline ore is a sodium and potassium containing aluminosilcate that contains more silica than alumina. In order 
to make silica insoluble at the leaching process, it is combined with lime forming 2CaO • SiO2 (belite) using the 
sintering process. The belite mud may be used in the cement production whereas sodium and potassium streams 
may be used to produce soda ash and potash resulting in complex processing of nepheline raw material.  
The main steps in the process are (refer to Figure 4.12b): crushing and milling of nepheline with limestone and 
recycled soda liquor forming the raw mix; and sintering of the raw mix (at about 1300°C) in rotary kilns where 
calcium carbonate is decomposed and the following reaction between calcium oxide and nepheline takes place, 
forming CO2:

The nepheline sinter is leached with the dissolution of alkali aluminate. The sinter residue is separated and 
transported to be used in cement production and the aluminate liquor is passed on for desilication to remove 
partially dissolved silica from the liquor. Then, alumina hydrate is obtained from the green liquor partly by 
decomposition and partly by carbonisation. Carbonisation captures CO2 in the process (Figure 4.12b).  
The main sources of greenhouse gases emissions from the nepheline process are similar to the Bayer-sintering 
process. To avoid double counting CO2 emissions related to by-products produced alongside alumina (i.e. belite 
mud for cement, soda ash, potash), shall be considered only in relation to the raw materials required for the 
aluminium production process. 
 
OTHER GHG SOURCES AND CAPTURE 
CO2 and CH4 are also produced during other sub-processes that are implemented or may be implemented at all 
alumina refineries but the emissions from such processes are currently considered to be negligible and not a main 
source of GHG emissions (<1 percent, expert judgement). 
Examples of such sub-processes include: flue gas desulphurization, acid cleaning of process equipment, organic 
carbon in bauxite, liquor burning, etc. 
 
There are also a number of CO2 capture pathways to consider: 
• 
Carbonisation; 
• 
CO2 absorption through use of bauxite residue for flue gas desulphurization; 
• 
CO2 absorption through use of water collected from bauxite/nepheline storage residue area. 
 
As noted throughout Volume 3 on Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), the emission estimation 
methodologies outlined in this Chapter consider only process-related emissions and do not consider energy-related 
emissions. Inventory compilers should ensure that energy-related emissions are accounted for in the Energy Sector 
and that there is no double-counting of emissions between the Energy and IPPU Sectors. For example, the 
calculation of CO2 emissions from fuel consumed in lime calcination, sintering, alumina hydrate calcination and 
electricity and heat production at a facility’s own boilers, CHP or power plants should be considered using the 
guidance related to the combustion of fossil fuels.  
 
 
 
 
 
17 There is only a single alumina refinery that uses this technology (Russia) and estimate is based on its annual 
production as a proportion of total global alumina production.

Part of CO2 after Sintering is passed through gas treatment facilities to remove particles and other harmful 
components and then forwarded to carbonisators, where the carbonisation reaction proceeds step by step. This is 
done in a two-stage process. 
 
CO2 absorption through use of circulating water collected from bauxite/nepheline 
storage residue area 
If a refinery uses circulating water collected from bauxite/nepheline storage residue area, which contains a lot of 
sodium alkaline to treat flue gas to remove particles, SO2 and other acid gases it should be assumed that the 
scrubbing system will also remove some CO2 in the flue gas. The efficiency of CO2 capture is very dependent on 
concentration of sodium alkaline in circulating water and type of scrubbing technology. If there is a lack of direct 
measurement data on CO2/CO in flue gas where such scrubbing system is used, it is not recommended that CO2 
removal be considered in CO2 calculations. 
 
CO2 absorption through bauxite residue neutralization 
Carbonation of bauxite residue (red mud) can be carried out to utilize the capacity of this waste to capture CO2 
and in turn, the capacity of CO2 to neutralize the highly alkaline red mud. The absorption of CO2 is rapid and can 
be efficient if there is good contact between the residue and the CO2.  For high concentration CO2 streams (90 
percent or more) the reaction can be virtually 100 percent with a few seconds contact. Total alkalinity of red mud 
drops drastically with the added CO2 recorded as an increase in bicarbonate alkalinity.  
For lower concentrations of CO2 such as flue gas where concentrations may be 12-15 percent, the reaction 
efficiency will be reduced.  If CO2 removal data is not available for bauxite residue contacted with gases containing 
less than 50 percent CO2, then it is recommended that reaction efficiency of 35 percent be assumed by default. 
CO2 absorption can be estimated by multiplying the quantity of CO2 injected into the process multiplied by the 
measured or assumed reaction efficiency.  
Measurement of the increase in bicarbonate in the residue can also be used as a better measure of the amount of 
CO2 actually absorbed in the neutralization process.  
 
4.4.5.2 
CHOICE OF METHOD FOR ALUMINA PRODUCTION 
The decision tree in Figure 4.12c describes good practice in choosing the most appropriate method based on 
national circumstances.  
In the Tier 1 method, emissions are estimated using alumina production data and national or default emission 
factors for the relevant technologies. The estimation of emissions directly from alumina production, without 
process specific information about raw materials and technology, is subject to high levels of uncertainty. This is 
because emissions from carbonates decomposition in the sintering and/or lime calcination processes can vary 
significantly. 
Tier 2 implements method from Tier 1 but country-specific emission factors should be applied. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use   
 
4.68 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The Tier 3 approach relies on plant specific data. Tier 3 methods should also include a correction for emissions of 
dust. Tier 3 also includes a correction addition for emissions associated with dust not recycled to the kiln. Any 
uncalcined dust not recycled to the kiln should be subtracted from the total emissions estimate. 
Should CO2 capture technology be installed and used at a plant, it is good practice to deduct the CO2 captured in 
a higher tier emissions calculation (Tier 3). The default assumption is that there is no CO2 capture and storage 
(CCS) taking place. Any methodology taking into account CO2 capture should consider that CO2 emissions 
captured in the process may be both fuel combustion and process-related. In cases where combustion and process 
emissions are to be reported separately, e.g. for alumina production, inventory compilers should ensure that the 
same quantities of CO2 are not double counted. In these cases, the total amount of CO2 captured should preferably 
be reported in the corresponding energy combustion and IPPU source categories in proportion to the amounts of 
CO2 generated in these source categories. For additional information on CO2 capture and storage refer to Volume 
3, Section 1.2.2 (under Industrial Processes and Product Use) and Volume 2, Section 2.3.4 (Under Energy). 
 
TIER 1 METHOD FOR SINTERING 
The Tier 1 method for lime production emissions is described in (Volume 3, Section 2.3.1.1). To avoid double 
counting, before applying this method it is essential to check whether lime production data from alumina plants is 
already considered in the inventory for lime production. If the lime production process at alumina plants has not 
been, included, the emissions associated with this process shall be considered as source related to alumina 
production. To attribute lime production emissions specifically to alumina production, it is necessary to gather 
data on how much of the national lime production occurs at alumina plants. 
The Tier 1 method for the sintering process (including BSP, BSS and NP alumina production processes) is based 
on default emission factors, but requires country specific activity data on production mass produced by BSS, BSP 
and NP processes. If the Bayer-sinter (BS) process is used, the GHG emissions from the sintering are dependent 
on the quality of bauxite and the silica content of the bauxite. High silica content, low content of Al2O3 in ore leads 
to use of high carbonate content which results in greater GHG emissions. In case of Nepheline processing (NP), 
GHG emissions from the sintering are dependant on the Al2O3 content of the nepheline ore. 
If detailed and complete data (including mass and composition) for the carbonates consumed in the sintering and 
lime production processes are not available, it is good practice to use aggregated national alumina production data, 
based on the technology applied, raw material and data on the proportion of Bayer and Bayer-sintering, expressed 
as an emission factor in the following Equation 4.27g:

The Tier 1 approach is based on the following assumptions about the alumina production and sintering process:

The mass fraction of alumina produced by sintering process (rather than the leaching process) is 
stable over time; 
• 
In case of alumina production from the nepheline ore, 100 percent of alumina is produced with the 
sintering process; 
• 
Plants are generally able to control the CaCO3 content of the raw material inputs and output of 
sintering process within close tolerances; 
• 
The CaCO3 content of the raw materials inputs from a given plant tends not to change significantly 
over time; 
• 
The main source of the CaO for most plants is CaCO3 and, at least at the plant-specific level, any 
major non-carbonated sources of CaO are readily quantified (see Section 4.4.5.3 below); 
• 
A 100 percent (or very close to it) calcination factor is achieved for the carbonate inputs for sintering 
output, including (commonly to a lesser degree) material lost to the system as non-recycled dust; and  
• 
Dust collectors at plants capture essentially all of the dust; 
• 
The capture of CO2 cannot be quantified and assumed to be zero.

4.27g, but with regional or country specific emissions factors for calculation of CO2 from sintering, instead of 
default emission factors.

TIER 3 METHOD FOR SINTERING: USE OF CARBONATE INPUT DATA 
Where national level data for lime production at alumina refineries are available on the types of lime produced, it 
is good practice to estimate emissions using a Tier 3 approach described in of Chapter 2, Section 2. 
For sintering processes, CO2 emissions are calculated using a mass balance approach that considers the carbonates 
and carbon content of input and output materials. Carbonates of input materials are destroyed due to high 
temperatures in sintering kilns. The Tier 3 method uses actual concentrations of impurities.  
Tier 3 is based on the collection of disaggregated data on the types (compositions) and quantities of carbonates 
consumed in the sintering process at a particular plant, as well as the respective emission factors of the carbonates 
consumed. Emissions are then calculated using Equation 4.27h. The Tier 3 approach includes an adjustment to 
subtract any uncalcined carbonate within sintering kiln dust (SKD) that is not returned to the kiln. If the SKD is 
fully calcined, or all of it is returned to the kiln, this SKD correction factor becomes zero. Tier 3 is still considered 
to be good practice in instances where inventory compilers do not have access to data on uncalcined SKD.  
However, excluding uncalcined SKD may result in slightly overestimated emissions. 
Limestones and shales (raw materials) may also contain a proportion of organic carbon (kerogen), and other raw 
materials (e.g., fly ash) may contain carbon residues, which would yield additional CO2 when burned. These 
emissions typically are not accounted for in the Energy Sector, but if carbon-containing raw materials are used 
extensively, inventory compilers should endeavour to see if they are included in the Energy Sector. Currently 
however, there is insufficient data on the kerogen or carbon contents of non-fuel raw materials for mineral 
processes to allow a meaningful default value related to the average kerogen content of raw materials to be 
provided in this chapter. For plant-level raw material-based calculations (Tier 3) where the kerogen content is high 
(i.e., contributes more than 5 percent of total heat), it is good practice to include the kerogen contribution to 
emissions. 
The Tier 3 approach will likely only be practical for individual plants and countries that have access to detailed 
plant-level data on the carbonate raw materials. Emissions data collected at the plant level should then be 
aggregated for purposes of reporting national emissions estimates. It is recognized that frequent calculations of 
emissions based on direct analysis of carbonates could be burdensome for some plants. As long as detailed 
chemical analyses of the carbonate inputs are carried out with sufficient frequency to establish a good correlation 
between the carbonates consumed at the plant level and the resulting alumina production, the sinter output may 
then be used as a proxy for carbonates for emissions calculations in the intervening periods. That is, a plant may 
derive a rigorously-constrained emission factor for the plant’s alumina, based on periodic calibration to the 
carbonate inputs and outputs.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS FOR ALUMINA 
PRODUCTION  
Emissions factors for Sintering can be chosen based on available data. In the case that site-specific data is not 
available, Tier 1 default emission factors can be used. Emissions factors for lime production are provided in 
Volume 3, Section 3.3.1.2. 
 
TIER 1 METHOD FOR SINTERING 
The implementation of sintering processes is determined by bauxite quality (alumina content), carbonates and 
silica content in the ore which can vary significantly. Based on existing process data from operating plants, Tier 1 
emissions factors were derived for Bayer-sintering processes and the nepheline-sintering process (NP), to be 
applied in Equation 4.27g (see Table 4.17a). For Bayer-sintering process Tier 1 emissions factors can be applied 
for both parallel (BSP) and sequential (BSS) processes.

described above.

 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories

TIER 2 METHOD FOR SINTERING 
Country-specific emission factors should be collected based on knowledge of technologies (technological routes) 
implemented at a country’s facilities and also based on data for lime (country-specific carbon content). Tier 1 
method then should be applied.  
If alumina plants have sintering processes, site specific data should be obtained relating to the volume of alumina 
production, percent of alumina produced with sintering. Plant specific volume of alumina production, percentage 
of alumina produced with sintering and information about the bauxite sources or technology and country specific 
emissions factors shall be calculated and should be provided for each national-level GHG emissions calculation 
campaign. 
 
TIER 3 METHOD FOR SINTERING 
The Tier 3 emission factors are based on the actual CO2 content of the carbonates present (see Equation 4.27h in 
this chapter and Table 2.1 of Volume 3, Chapter 2 Mineral Industry Emissions).). The Tier 3 approach requires 
the full accounting of carbonates (species and sources). 
CO2 emissions captured by other CO2 capturing technologies can be calculated using site specific data only. Where 
such data is unavailable, CO2 emissions captured do not considered in CO2 emissions calculation.  
If there is no site-specific data for mass of carbon in bauxite or nepheline residue, the following data can be used 
as worldwide figures: 
• 
CO2 in bauxite and nepheline residue 1 percent of dry content with a ± 50 percent uncertainty range19.  
 
Emissions correction factor for sintering kiln dust (SKD) 
Dust may be generated at various points in the kiln line apparatus used for sintering. The composition of this dust 
can vary depending on where it is generated but all may be included under the term ‘sintering kiln dust’ (SKD). 
SKD includes particulates derived from the raw materials, and the original carbonate component of the dust may 
be incompletely calcined. SKD can be efficiently captured by dust control technology and then recycled to the kiln 
(the preferred practice), or it may be directly returned to the kiln in the combustion air, or it may be disposed of 
after capture. The degree to which SKD can be recycled to the kiln depends on various considerations and usually 
100 percent of collected dust are returned to the kiln. Any SKD not recycled to the kiln is considered to be ‘lost’ 
to the process and emissions associated with it will not be accounted for in the sintering process. To the degree 
that the lost SKD represents calcined carbonate raw materials, the emissions from these calcined raw materials 
represent a subtraction in the Tier 3 calculation. The kiln dust may consist of dust from raw materials as well as 
dust from the burning of liquid or solid fuels. In that case where combustion and process emissions are to be 
reported separately, e.g. for alumina production, it is good practice for inventory compilers ensure that the carbon 
in the dust related to fuel combustion is not double counted. In these cases, the total amount of C in the dust from 
fuel burning should preferably be extracted from IPPU source categories in proportion to the amounts of CO2 
generated in these source categories.  
 
4.4.5.4 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
TIER 1 METHOD 
In Tier 1, national-level data should be collected only for those plants where lime calcination processes are part of 
alumina production process. However, calcined lime purchased from other producers should not be considered to 
avoid double counting.  
If a proportion of calcined lime is produced for uses other than alumina production, to avoid double counting CO2 
emissions from carbonates decomposition at the lime calcination kiln shall be related to alumina production in the 
proportion of lime used for alumina production only. CO2 emissions related to other uses of calcined lime shall be 
reported as emissions related to lime calcination described at Chapter 2 Section 2.3.  The detailed information 
about choice of activity data for lime production please refer to Section 2.3.1.3 in Volume 3, Chapter 2. 
If alumina plants have sintering processes, site specific data should be obtained relating to the volume of alumina 
production, percent of alumina produced with sintering. Plant specific volume of alumina production, percentage

of alumina produced with sintering and information about the bauxite sources or technology should be provided 
for each national-level GHG emissions calculation campaign.  
 
TIER 2 METHOD 
In Tier 2, national-level data should be collected only for those plants where sintering/lime calcination processes 
are part of alumina production process. However, calcined lime purchased from other producers should not be 
considered to avoid double counting. 
 
 
TIER 3 METHODS 
For lime production process refer to Section 2.3.1.3 Choice of Activity Data in Volume 3, Chapter 2. 
The type of activity data required for Tier 3 is likely available only at individual plants. Any reporting entity using 
Tier 3 should ensure that all carbonate inputs (i.e., types, amounts, all sources) to the kiln are fully investigated as 
part of the initial implementation of the Tier 3 method, and the full investigation repeated whenever there is any 
significant change in materials or processes. After a full analysis of the carbonate inputs is completed, and 
assuming that no significant change in the composition of materials or production process takes place, it is 
consistent with good practice to develop a rigorous plant-specific emission factor based on the carbonate input 
analysis and apply that emission factor to sintering process. Subsequently, the sintering production data may then 
be used for the carbonate calculations to estimate emissions. To be consistent with good practice, this linkage 
should be periodically recalibrated.  
In general, data related to carbonated input materials should be collected annually. However, it is likely that there 
could be a carbonate component within the mass of carbon in bauxite or nepheline residue, emissions from un-
calcined SKD not recycled to the kiln, and perhaps some other fuels (emissions from carbon-bearing nonfuel 
materials). If, during the full investigation, it is determined that the amount of carbonates from non-major sources 
is small (e.g., less than 5 percent of total carbonate) the plant can apply a constant value for the minor source(s) in 
intervening years before the next full investigation. Recognizing that estimating activity data for these smaller 
sources may lead to analytical (and other) errors, it may be assumed for emission calculation purposes that the 
minor source of carbonate is CaCO3, but this assumption should be transparently documented. 
Activity data should exclude any carbonates that are not fed into the kiln.  
4.4.5.5 
COMPLETENESS 
Alumina production data may be available in national statistical databases, or could be collected, if such data have 
not been published in national statistics.  
Completeness is a particularly important issue to consider where plant specific data are used to estimate national 
emissions using Tier 3. Under Tier 3, it is important that all alumina plants with lime production and sintering 
processes are considered, and that all carbonates consumed in the sintering process are included in the emission 
calculation. Plants with bauxites/nephelines sintering processes are well identified in each country, but data on the 
fraction weight of carbonates consumed may not be readily available. In order for the Tier 3 method to be 
considered ‘complete’, all carbonates consumed must be recorded. 
In countries where only a subset of plants with lime production and bauxites/nephelines sintering processes report 
data for the Tier 3 method, it may not be possible to report emissions using a Tier 3 for all facilities during the 
transition. Where data on the carbonate inputs are not available for all plants to report using Tier 3, it may be 
possible to determine the share of production represented by non-reporting plants and use this information to 
estimate the remaining emissions using Tier 1 in order to ensure completeness during the transition period.  
The potential for double counting also should be considered. For example, it is good practice for inventory 
compilers to review statistics used to estimate emissions from the source category ‘Other Process Uses of 
Carbonates’ and ‘Lime production’ to ensure that emissions reported in that source category do not result from the 
use of these carbonates in alumina production. Where carbonates are used for alumina production, it is good 
practice to report the emissions under Alumina Production. Finally, inventory compilers should include only 
process-related emissions from alumina production in this source category. To avoid double-counting, it is good 
practice to account for combustion-related emissions in the Energy volume. 
There is one additional issue that, while not included in the current methodology, may become relevant for 
consideration in the future. Sodium alkaline contained in bauxite/nepheline residue area can re-absorb atmospheric 
CO2. However, the rate of carbonation is very slow (years to centuries).

4.4.5.6 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
 It is good practice to collect site specific data where possible for all inventory years. However, often it can be 
difficult to collate historic data for closures, closed operations or if significant changes in changes in technology 
or sourcing of bauxites/nephelines has taken place. In such cases, inventory compilers can consult industry experts 
to assist with extrapolation of CO2 emission figures (e.g. normalization by volume of alumina production or based 
on applying of data from similar plants in the reporting country or average worldwide figures for similar 
technology). See also Chapters 2 and 5 of Volume 1 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
For lime production, refer to Section 2.3.1.5 in Chapter 2. 
4.4.6 
Uncertainty assessment for alumina production 
Uncertainty estimates for bauxite/nepheline sintering processes result predominantly from uncertainties associated 
with activity data, and to a lesser extent, from uncertainty related to the emission factor. 
Uncertainty estimates for lime production is described at Section 2.3.2 Uncertainty assessment in Chapter 2 
Volume 3 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
4.4.6.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES  
For Tier 1, the major uncertainty component is associated with the emission factor for sintering.  
For Tier 2 and 3, there is relatively little uncertainty associated with the emission factors of the source carbonates 
because they are based on plant specific data, stoichiometric ratios and mass balance approaches.  
4.4.6.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
The uncertainty for percentage of bauxite/nepheline processing at sintering process is moderate. The level of 
uncertainty is indicated in the Table. 4.17b. The uncertainty in data on alumina production tonnages is about 1 
percent. 
For Tier 3, the uncertainty in data on weight or mass of i ore recalculated per dry conditions consumed in the kiln 
tonnages, is about 1-2 percent. Collecting data from individual producers (if complete) rather than using national 
totals will reduce the uncertainty of the estimate because these data will account for variations in conditions at the 
plant level. Except for SKD the greatest sources of uncertainty associated with Tier 3 are the uncertainties 
associated with identification of carbonate species (1-5 percent) and the weight of raw materials. 
Although emissions are much smaller than from carbonates, there may be considerable uncertainty associated with 
estimating emissions from SKD in Tier 3 if plants do not weigh the SKD that is not recycled to the kiln or if the 
plants lack SKD scrubbers. Where the weight and composition of SKD are unknown for a plant, the uncertainty 
will be higher. As an example, an estimate of the uncertainties for different factors is presented in equations 4.27h-
4.27n. The uncertainties are presented in Table 4.17b and are approximate component uncertainties – that is, they 
are those associated with a particular operation or activity in the bauxite/nepheline processing at sintering process. 
In order to quantify uncertainty for bauxite/nepheline processing at sintering process, the default uncertainties 
provided in Table 4.17b should be combined.

QUALITY ASSURANCE / QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
In addition to the general guidance on QA/QC, specific procedures of relevance to this source category are outlined 
below. 
 
COMPARISON OF EMISSIONS ESTIMATES USING DIFFERENT 
APPROACHES 
Comparisons could be made between estimated emissions using different tiers. For example, if a bottom-up 
approach is used to collect activity data (i.e., collection of plant-specific data), then inventory compilers should 
compare the emissions estimates to the estimates calculated using national production data alumina production 
(top-down approach). In cases where a hybrid Tier 1 or Tier 3 approach is used during a transition period, it is 
considered good practice also to estimate emissions for all facilities using the lower Tier in order to compare the 
results of the analysis to the results derived using the hybrid approach. The results of such comparisons should be 
recorded for internal documentation, including explanations for any discrepancies. 
 
REVIEW OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Inventory compilers should compare aggregated national emission factors with the IPCC default factors in order 
to determine if the national factor is reasonable relative to the IPCC default. Differences between national factors 
and default factors should be explained and documented, particularly if they are representative of different 
circumstances. 
If the aggregated top-down approach is used, but some limited plant-specific data are available, inventory 
compilers should compare the site or plant level factors with the aggregated factor used for the national estimate. 
This will provide an indication of the reasonableness and the representability of the data. 
 
SITE-SPECIFIC ACTIVITY DATA CHECK 
For site-specific data, inventory compilers should review inconsistencies between sites to establish whether they 
reflect errors, different measurement techniques, or result from real differences in emissions, operational

conditions or technology. For alumina production, inventory compilers should compare plant data with other plants 
in the country. 
Inventory compilers should ensure that emission factors and activity data are developed in accordance with 
internationally recognised and proven measurement methods. If the measurement practices fail this criterion, then 
the use of these emissions or activity data should be carefully evaluated, uncertainty estimates reconsidered, and 
qualifications documented. If there is a high standard of measurement and QA/QC in place at most sites, then the 
uncertainty of the emissions estimates may be revised downwards. 
4.4.7.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates. Specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category follow. 
TIER 1 METHOD 
Any information regarding the carbonates content of sintering feed should be documented, including use of default 
values different from those discussed in section 4.4.5.3. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
Any county-specific information should be documented (technologies, amount of alumina produced by each 
technology type, amount and quality of lime used, etc.)  
TIER 3 METHOD 
When documenting the Tier 3 method it is important to document all the procedures undertaken and methodologies 
used to identify the weight fraction and identities of all carbonates, including carbonates incorporated in any raw 
materials along with the corresponding emission factors. 
Estimating total emissions from carbonate inputs can overestimate emissions if the carbonates are not fully 
calcined. Any corrections should be documented. This includes documenting the fraction calcination of the raw 
materials and the quantity and fraction calcination of the SKD. 
It is likely that plants will find it impractical to undertake chemical analyses of all raw material inputs on a daily 
basis for the purpose of CO2 calculations. Instead, it is good practice for a full analysis to take place at each facility 
on a number of occasions throughout the year to fully characterise the carbonate inputs. Facilities will likely 
develop a relationship between carbonate input and alumina production that will be applied to the plant’s routine 
calculation alumina production with sintering for intervening periods. In addition to identifying all procedures 
used to calculate emissions from the carbonate inputs, all steps necessary to identify the relationship between 
carbonate input and alumina production should be documented.  
All underlying information should be documented and reported, it is not considered good practice to report just 
final emissions estimates.

RARE EARTHS PRODUCTION 
This sub-chapter 4.8 “Rare Earths Production” provides new guidance for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 
the primary production of rare earth (RE) metals and alloys 20, specifically CO2 and perfluorocarbon (PFC) 
emissions. Since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines do not have existing guidance on emissions from the rare earths 
industry, this is an entirely new sub-chapter, and follows on sub-chapter 4.7 Chapter 4 Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines.  
4.8.1 
Introduction 
‘Rare earths’ is used to refer to the group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements of scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y) 
and the lanthanides, i.e.: lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), promethium (Pm), 
samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), 
thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb) and lutetium (Lu). The raw materials and trading goods are often in the form of rare 
earth oxides (REO).  
Worldwide, primary production of many RE metals and alloys is carried out using a molten fluoride-salt 
electrolytic reduction process that is similar to primary aluminium’s Hall-Heroult process21 (refer to sub-chapter 
4.4). According to (Vogel & Friedrich 2015; Vogel & Friedrich 2018; Zhang et al. 2018), this involves: 
• 
Dissolving and electrolytically reducing REOs (e.g. Nd2O3) in a molten salt of rare earth fluorides (REF3) and 
lithium fluoride (LiF) – an example composition is 85 percent wt NdF3, 10 percent LiF and 5 percent Nd2O3 
for Nd metal production; 
• 
Carbon anodes (e.g. graphite), which are consumed in the process; 
• 
Cathodes, which are either inert (e.g. tungsten cathodes for Nd metal production) or are consumed in the 
process (e.g. Fe cathodes for Dy-Fe alloy production); 
• 
A process that is carried out at high temperature (~1050-1100°C);  
• 
Depending on the technology, a process that may be periodically interrupted or disturbed by anode 
replacements, cathode removal/replacement and removal of liquid RE metal/alloy, etc.  
Nd is one of the most commonly produced RE metals by this process. Other RE metals and alloys produced via 
this route include: Pr, Pr-Nd, La, Dy-Fe, Gd-Fe, Ho-Fe, Ce, La-Ce, Y-Mg and mischmetal (Vogel & Friedrich 
2018).  
Alternative routes for RE metal and alloy production are outside the scope of these guidelines, since they are either 
not employed on an industrial scale or do not generate GHGs (Vogel & Friedrich 2018). These include chloride-
salt electrolytic reduction (now largely replaced by the fluoride-based process) and calciothermic reduction (e.g. 
for production of samarium for Sm-Co magnets).  
Industrial fluoride-based rare earth smelters vary in terms of electrical current (and hence size), the number and 
configuration of anodes and cathodes, and the level of automation in the process. Currently, the most widely used 
technologies are those at lower amperage (~5-6 kA) – these typically employ small round-shaped cells, with only 
single (or several) vertical anodes and cathodes and typically have very low levels of automation. Higher amperage 
technologies typically are larger, oval or rectangular shaped cells and are equipped with multiple vertical anodes 
and/or cathodes (Wen et al. 2004; Wen et al. 2012; Vogel & Friedrich 2015).   
In general, the level of automation in rare earth production is considerably lower than that found in primary 
aluminium production (sub-section 4.4). However, some newer production technologies may be equipped with 
automatic process control features, including automatic feeding of REOs and automatic detection of anode effects, 
in order to increase production efficiency and reduce perfluorocarbon GHG emissions (refer to section 4.8.2.3). 
 
20  CO2 emissions associated with the production of electricity from fossil fuel combustion to produce rare earth metals and 
alloys are covered in Volume 2: Energy. 
21  Due to similarities between the primary aluminium and rare earth metal smelting processes (both produce metal from 
electrolysis of metal oxides in molten fluoride-salts, using consumable carbon anodes), the guidelines here for the rare earths 
industry have been adapted using existing guidelines for primary aluminium production (2006 IPCC Guidelines, Volume 3, 
Chapter 4, sub-chapter 4.4) as a basis. Although both processes generate CO2 and PFC emissions through similar fundamental 
mechanisms, there are clear differences in technology and cell design, production scale, cathode and raw materials, operating 
conditions (amperage, voltage, temperature) and particularly levels of automation. Therefore, the guidance provided here is 
specific to current understanding of rare earth metals production.  
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions  
 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.83 
In the fluoride-based rare earths smelting process, the most significant GHG process emissions are (Liu et al. 2001; 
Vogel et al. 2017; Cai et al. 2018):  
1. CO2 emissions from the consumption of carbon anodes in the electrolytic reaction converting rare earth 
oxides to rare earth metals;  
2. PFCs emissions of CF4 and C2F6 during anode effects. While not commonly observed, very low levels of 
C3F8 and trace levels of other PFCs (e.g. c-C4F8 and C4F10) have also been reported (Cai et al. 2018).   
CO is another major process emission; SO2 might also be emitted in very small amounts.   
The decision trees in Figure 4.17 and Figure 4.18 provide guidance for selecting a methodology to estimate CO2 
and PFC emissions, respectively, from rare earth metal production. Since default emission factors have been 
provided, all inventory compilers in countries with rare earth metal production should be able to implement at a 
minimum level the Tier 1 method and thereby ensure completeness of reporting.  
4.8.2 
Methodological Issues 
4.8.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD FOR CO2 EMISSIONS FROM PRIMARY 
RARE EARTH METAL PRODUCTION 
During normal operations, rare earth metals are produced at the cathode and carbon is consumed at the anode, 
forming CO and CO2 gases by electrolysis, as per the generic electrolytic reduction reactions below for production 
of any RE from REO (Liu et al. 2001; Vogel et al. 2017) :

While CO is the most dominant gas produced in these reactions (Liu et al. 2001; Vogel et al. 2017), it is assumed 
that all CO gas oxidises in the process and is ultimately emitted to the atmosphere as CO2 gas (Vogel & Friedrich 
2018), as follows:

Most CO2 emissions therefore result from the electrolysis reaction of the carbon anode with rare earth oxides 
(REO). The consumption of carbon anodes is the principal source of process related CO2 emissions from primary 
rare earth production. The reactions leading to CO2 emissions are relatively well understood and the emissions are 
directly connected to the tonnes of RE metal or alloy produced, through the fundamental electrochemical equations 
for RE oxide reduction at a carbon anode and oxidation from thermal processes. Both of these fundamental 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use   
 
4.84 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
processes producing carbon dioxide should be included in process parameters routinely monitored at production 
facilities, i.e. the net anode carbon consumed.   
Due to a lack of published information, no other sources of process-related CO2 emissions have been considered 
in these guidelines. For example, it is assumed that industrial rare earth facilities currently do not manufacture or 
‘pre-bake’ their own carbon anodes, but rather they purchase graphite anodes. This is the case in the Chinese rare 
earth metal industry in 2018 (expert opinion), given the much lower process volumes and smaller anode sizes 
compared to the primary aluminium industry (which uses prebaked carbon anodes, refer to sub-chapter 4.4.2.1). 
Hence GHGs from anode baking (and associated energy use) are not considered here. 
The decision tree shown in Figure 4.17 describes good practice in choosing the CO2 inventory methodology 
appropriate for national circumstances.

Notes: 
1. For discussion of key categories and use of decision trees, see Volume 1, Chapter 4, Methodological Choice and Identification of Key 
Categories (noting Section 4.1.2 on limited resources). 
2. For Tier 1 CO2 emissions calculation, the production data does not require differentiation of specific rare earth metals and alloys produced 
(Nd, Pr, Ce, La metals and/or Nd-Pr, Dy-Fe alloys, etc). There is also no need for further differentiation as to the type of rare earth cell 
technology used at each facility.  
3. The decision tree only provides a two-tiered methodology: Tier 1 using default emission factors, and Tier 3 using facility-specific anode 
consumption + anode composition data. An additional Tier 2 method using default factors for anode composition data (corresponding to Tier 
2 in the CO2 decision tree for aluminium production, sub-chapter 4.4.2.1) has not been provided, since there is no default anode composition 
data for rare earths publicly available. 
 
 
Tier 1 method for CO2 emissions – default emission factors 
The Tier 1 method for calculating CO2 emissions is through multiplying a default emission factor by rare earth 
metal production. Given the uncertainty associated with the Tier 1 method, it is good practice to use higher tier

methods if CO2 from primary rare earths is a key category. Total CO2 emissions from all rare earth (RE) metals 
and alloys produced are calculated according to Equation 4.35.

Only one default CO2 emission factor has been provided in these guidelines, taking Nd metal as the base case – 
refer to Table 4.26. The scarcity of published data means that default emission factors are not available for other 
RE metals and alloys. However, Equation 4.35 includes a factor to correct the default to account for differences in 
atomic weight among the RE metals.  This factor is the atomic weight for Nd divided by the atomic weight of the 
metal or alloy actually produced. Taking Dy-Fe alloy as an example (assuming 80 percent Dy, 20 percent Fe by 
weight)22, the atomic weight is 117.59 g/mol and the atomic weight ratio (AWbase / AWi) is 1.23. Note that Equation 
4.35 could be used for more precise estimates of total CO2 emissions from RE metals production if more Tier 1 
default factors for specific RE metals/alloys become available in the future. In that case, where an emission factor 
for a particular RE metal was applied to that RE metal, the atomic weight ratio (AWbase / AWi) would simply be set 
to 1.  
 
Tier 3 method for CO2 emissions – by facility-specific carbon mass balance 
In the Tier 3 method, CO2 emissions are calculated using a mass balance approach that assumes that the carbon 
content of net anode consumption23 is all ultimately emitted to the atmosphere as CO2 gas24.  The Tier 3 method 
uses actual concentrations of anode impurities from each facility.  The choice of method between the Tier 1 and 
Tier 3 method will depend on whether process data for (i) net carbon anode consumption and (ii) baked anode 
composition are both available from individual facilities. Unfortunately, a more generic Tier 2 method (similar to 
that for aluminium production, in sub-section 4.4.2.1) using default factors for net anode consumption and anode 
composition (including impurity levels) is not available due to the scarcity of published information. 
CO2 emissions for the Tier 3 method are calculated according to Equation 4.36. This requires facility-specific 
operating data for all the components in Equation 4.36. Note this assumes the same anode composition is used for 
production of all RE metals and alloys; where the anode composition differs, replace Impa with Impi, the impurity 
content of the anodes used to produce each type of RE metal / alloy.

23  ‘Net anode consumption’ (NAC) refers to the total anode consumption per tonne of metal, minus any unused or ‘spent’ 
anode material when old anodes are exchanged for new anodes. This unused or ‘spent’ anode material is not consumed in 
the electrolysis process but might be recycled to make new anodes.  
24  While CO is the most dominant gas product from the rare earths electrolytic reduction reaction (Liu et al. 2001), it is assumed 
that any CO formed eventually is converted to CO2 gas. The same carbon mass-balance approach is assumed for the primary 
aluminium industry, in sub-chapter 4.4.2.1.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS FOR CO2 EMISSIONS FROM 
PRIMARY RARE EARTH METAL PRODUCTION 
Tier 1 method for CO2 emissions 
Table 4.26 lists the default emission factors for CO2 per tonne of RE metal, for use in Equation 4.35. Given the 
scarcity of published data and since only minor differences in emission factors are expected across different RE 
metals and alloy types25, only one default emission factor is provided for all RE metals. This uses Nd metal 
production as the basis, since it is the most common RE metal produced via fluoride-salt electrolysis. It is good 
practice to check the EFDB as a source for future CO2 emission factors for rare earth metals production.

Source:  
a CO2 default emission factor is based on a net anode carbon consumption of 152 kg C/tonne RE metal (average anode consumption 
reported from 4 industrial production lines in China - (Cai et al. 2018)) and converting this to CO2 by mass balance, assuming 100% 
conversion of anode carbon to CO2, an approach consistent with that used in aluminium production (refer to section 4.4.2.1). These 
production lines are considered representative of current technology in China, where >90% of global RE metal was produced in 2018 
(Cai et al. 2018); as such the default emission factor is considered representative of current global RE metal production, via fluoride-salt 
electrolysis. The emission factor is also consistent with values from a first principles / mass balance approach (see note b).  
b A first principles calculation for CO2 was done by taking electrolysis of Nd2O3 to Nd metal as a basis (see Section 4.8.2.1 for 
stoichiometric reactions), assuming a gas production ratio of ~75% CO, 25% CO2 by direct electrolysis at 1050°C and anode current 
density of 1.0 A/cm2 (Liu et al. 2001); Vogel and Friedrich (2015). CO2 is then calculated assuming: (i) all CO is ultimately oxidised to 
CO2, (ii) process has a 75% faradaic current efficiency (% anode carbon electrolytically consumed to produce metal), and (iii) an 
additional 10% anode carbon consumed via non-electrolytic processes (oxidation of carbon due to exposure with air). The obtained net 
anode carbon consumption (150 kg C / tonne RE metal) is consistent with that used for the default CO2 emission factor.  
 
TABLE 4.26 (NEW) (CONTINUED) 
TIER 1 DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS FOR CALCULATING CO2 EMISSIONS FROM ANODE CONSUMPTION 
c Assuming the default CO2 emissions factor represents a current efficiency of 75%, an uncertainty range of -22%/+24% from the default 
CO2 factor might be expected if individual facilities operate at a different current efficiency level (e.g. 60 to 95%), based on first principle 
calculations described in note b. However, actual variations in CO2 emissions may be as low as ±10%, based on highest and lowest 
industrial net carbon anode consumption values reported in (Cai et al. 2018), converted by mass balance to CO2. Therefore, where 
possible, development and use of Tier 3 emission factors is encouraged. 
 
 
25 A difference of only -4% / +8% in CO2 emission factors was estimated across different rare earth metals (from La to Gd 
metal, using Nd metal as a base case), when evaluating CO2 emissions by first principles (refer to note ‘b’ in Table 4.26). 
This is due to due to the similarities in atomic mass for these rare earth metals.

Tier 3 method for CO2 emissions  
Table 4.27 lists the facility-specific activity data (and uncertainties) at individual facilities, for use in Equation 
4.36. The most significant factors in Equation 4.36 are metal production and net anode consumption for each RE 
metal or alloy type i.  Both these parameters should be collected from individual operating facilities for use with 
Tier 3. The other compositional terms in the equation make minor adjustments for non-carbon components of the 
anodes (e.g. sulphur and ash, expected to be <3 percent wt) and thus are not as critical.  Tier 3 is based on the use 
of specific operating facility data for these minor components. Carbon consumed per tonne of metal produced is 
typically recorded by rare earth production facilities given its economic significance; facilities refer to this as ‘net 
anode consumption’ or ‘net carbon consumption’.

4.8.2.3 
CHOICE OF METHOD FOR PFCS  
During electrolysis of a RE metal, rare earth oxides (REOs) are dissolved in a fluoride melt comprising of rare 
earth fluorides (RExFy) and lithium fluoride (LiF). An example melt composition for Nd metal production is 85 
percent wt NdF3, 10 percent LiF and 5 percent Nd2O3.  
Perfluorocarbons (mainly CF4 and C2F6 – collectively referred to as PFCs) are formed from the reaction of the 
carbon anode with the fluoride melt (e.g. NdF3 or DyF3) during a process upset condition known as an ‘anode 
effect’. This occurs when the concentration of dissolved REO in the electrolyte is too low to completely support 
the standard anode reaction (normally producing RE metal and CO/CO2 gases), enabling additional anode reactions 
that form PFC gases (Vogel et al. 2017; Cai et al. 2018; Kjos et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). In addition to CF4 
and C2F6, other PFCs reported by Cai et al. (2018) during RE metal production included: very low levels of C3F8 
(<1 percent total PFCs) and trace levels of c-C4F8 and C4F10 (<0.05 percent total PFCs). However, quantification 
of these PFCs (other than CF4 and C2F6) in industrial measurements is extremely challenging and often impractical, 
given the extremely low detection limits required.

ANODE EFFECT DESCRIPTION (FOR RARE EARTH METAL PRODUCTION BY FLUORIDE ELECTROLYSIS) 
An ‘anode effect’ is a process upset condition where an insufficient amount of rare earth oxide is 
dissolved in the electrolyte, resulting in the emission of PFC-containing gases and causing voltage 
to be elevated above normal operating range. However, PFC generation might also occur in the 
absence of detectable changes in voltage (Vogel et al. 2017; Kjos et al. 2018). 
Unlike the analogous primary aluminium industry (refer to Box 4.2), many rare earth technologies 
currently do not use automated computer control systems to detect anode effects, for example using 
an elevated voltage threshold. As such, facility-specific activity data (e.g. anode effect performance 
data) is often not available to estimate PFC emissions.  
Due to reported differences in emissions profile (Cai et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018), PFC emissions can be 
estimated separately for two groups of rare earth metals and alloys: 
• 
Rare earth-iron (RE-Fe) alloys26 with high melting-point (>1300°C) rare earth elements, e.g. Dy-Fe, Gd-Fe 
and Ho-Fe;  
• 
All other rare earth (Other-RE) metals/alloys including single and mixed rare earth metals, e.g. Nd, La, Pr-
Nd, etc.  
In choosing a method for PFC emissions, it should be noted that the uncertainty associated with the Tier 3 
methodology is significantly lower than for Tier 1; therefore it is good practice to use Tier 3 methodologies if this 
is a key category. However, a pre-requisite for the Tier 3 method is the availability of facility-specific emission 
factors, obtained through individual facility measurements. While no good practice guidance currently exists on 
the measurement of PFCs and obtaining Tier 3 emission factors for the rare earth industry, the US EPA and IAI 
protocols for measurement of PFCs in the aluminium smelting industry provide good analogous references 
(International Aluminium Institute 2006; US Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium 
Institute 2008).  
The decision tree in Figure 4.18 describes good practice in choosing the PFC inventory methodology appropriate 
for national circumstances. The Tier 3 approach is preferred because plant-specific emission factors will lead to 
estimates that are more accurate. If no PFC measurements have been made to establish Tier 3 plant-specific 
emission factors, the Tier 1 method can be used until measurements have been made. Countries can use a 
combination of Tier 1 and Tier 3 depending on whether plant-specific emission factors are available from 
individual facilities.  
Note that while the fundamental mechanisms that generate PFCs and anode effects in the rare earths industry are 
similar to those in primary aluminium production (refer to sub-chapter 4.4), the lack of automation currently found 
in the rare earths industry prevents the use of facility-specific activity data (e.g. using anode effect performance 
data as per Tier 2 and 3 methods for PFC accounting in primary aluminium production) as a more accurate 
methodology for estimating PFCs. Therefore, higher Tier 2 and 3 methods using process performance statistics or 
activity data have not been included in these guidelines27. 
While rare earths production currently has a lower level of automation and process control compared to primary 
aluminium production (see sub-chapter 4.4), the industry is still very much under development. There is ongoing 
research to develop industrial technologies that can minimise PFC emissions (e.g. employing automation to ensure 
control of REO concentrations) (Vogel & Friedrich 2017; Martinez et al. 2018). However, due to the scarcity of 
published information on industrial emissions, separate PFC emission factors have not been provided for these 
technologies.  
Given the potential for further development within the industry, it is good practice to establish Tier 3 plant-specific 
emission factors for individual facilities where significant technology development and/or adoption of automated 
 
26  This category of RE-Fe alloys represented <5% of total rare earth metals/alloys produced by electrolysis in 2016 (expert 
opinion).  Due to their high melting point, these RE elements are typically produced using an alloying cathode (e.g. Fe) to 
form a liquid metal product, at higher operating cell voltage (compared to cells for all other RE metals/alloys in similar 
conditions). The higher operating temperature and cell voltage increases the risk of PFC generation and is thought to be one 
of the reasons behind the greater PFC emissions measured (expert opinion; Cai et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018).  
27  Accounting of PFCs using activity data - such as anode effect performance statistics - in the rare earths industry is possible. 
However this requires the industry to first have consistent definitions of anode effect performance, i.e. how to define the 
start/end of an anode effect to determine the frequency and the duration of anode effects. Secondly, the level of automation 
in rare earth facilities must be sufficiently high to ensure accurate and consistent records these anode effect performance 
statistics, a condition that does not currently reflect the majority of the rare earths industry.

control systems have taken place. Finally, it is good practice to check the EFDB as a source for future PFC 
emission factors for rare earths production.

Notes: 
1. While good practice guidelines for obtaining facility specific PFC emission factors from rare earth production facilities are currently not 
available, the IAI and US EPA/IAI greenhouse gas protocols for aluminium smelters are useful references due to the many similarities between 
primary aluminium and rare earth smelting using fluoride-salts (International Aluminium Institute 2006; US Environmental Protection Agency 
& International Aluminium Institute 2008).  
2. For discussion of key categories and use of decision trees, see Volume 1, Chapter 4, Methodological Choice and Identification of Key 
Categories (noting Section 4.1.2 on limited resources). 
3. For Tier 1 PFC emissions calculation, the production data requires differentiation of (a) rare-earth iron (RE-Fe) alloys, e.g. Dy-Fe and (b) 
all other rare earth (Other-RE) metals/alloys, e.g. Nd, Pr-Nd and La. However, there is no need for further differentiation as to the specific 
rare earth metal/alloy produced, or type of rare earth cell technology used at each facility.  
4. This decision tree only provides a two-tiered methodology: Tier 1 using default emission factors, Tier 3 using facility-specific emission 
factors. Additional Tier 2-3 methods using anode effect activity data to estimate PFC emissions (similar to the Tier 2-3 methods in the PFC 
decision tree for aluminium production, sub-chapter 4.4.2.3) has not been provided, due to the lack of available activity data.

Tier 1 and Tier 3 method for PFCs – by production  
Both Tier 1 and Tier 3 methods for calculating PFCs employ emission factors that are based on metal production. 
Methods are provided for CF4 and C2F6 gases since these are the major PFCs generated. C3F8 is also included for 
sake of completeness, however it is a very minor component of PFCs generated in rare earths (<1 percent total 
PFCs) and it can be challenging or impractical to quantify from industrial facilities (if obtaining Tier 3 facility-
specific emission factors), given the extremely low detection limits required. Estimation of all other PFCs are 
beyond the scope of this method as they are not significant (Cai et al. 2018). 
The Tier 1 method uses default emission factors based on industrial measurements. PFC emissions can be 
calculated according to Equation 4.37, where emission factors for CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 gases are default emission 
factors (refer to Table 4.28). The level of uncertainty in the Tier 1 methodology is greater because individual 
facility emissions performance28 is not taken into account. Note that some researchers (Vogel & Friedrich 2018) 
have estimated PFC emission factors two to three-orders of magnitude greater than the default values given in 
Table 4.28.  These higher values were not used here because they were not measured, but modelled based on a 
mass balance of NdF3 inputs to replace consumed fluorides, with the unlikely assumption that all consumed 
fluorides are due to PFC generation. Nevertheless, they do indicate that the PFC emission factors from some 
facilities may be higher than the Tier 1 factors presented here. Therefore, where possible, development and use of 
Tier 3 facility-specific PFC emission factors is encouraged. 
Note that Equation 4.37 enables calculation of PFC emissions by individual RE metal/alloy produced. However 
default emission factors are only available for two generic types of metals/alloys: (i) rare earth-iron alloys (e.g. 
Dy-Fe) and (ii) all other rare earth metals/alloys (e.g. Nd, Pr-Nd), rather than all possible combinations of RE 
metals / alloys due to the scarcity of published industrial emissions data29. RE-Fe alloys were reported to have 
greater PFC emissions than other RE metals (Cai et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018), consistent with the greater risk 
of PFC generation expected with the higher temperature and cell voltage operation required. Therefore, two default 
Tier 1 emission factors for RE metals have been provided in these guidelines (Table 4.28). Hence, Equation 4.37 
can be used with differentiation of RE metal production into these two metal/alloy types; further differentiation 
into specific RE metals/alloys is not required.

28  PFC emissions performance is impacted by technology, operating conditions and the anode effect performance of individual 
facilities. While anode effect performance data from facilities are used to directly estimate PFCs in the analogous aluminium 
smelting industry (refer to section 4.4.2.3), a similar method for rare earths has not been provided due to a lack of supporting 
data that characterises emissions according to process statistics, such as anode effect performance.   
29  While Tier 1 default emission factors are not available for all individual RE metal/alloy types, Equation 4.37 provides a 
template for the future (when such factors might become available) and for potential use in Tier 3 calculations. 
Chapter 4: Metal Industry Emissions  
 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.91 
The Tier 3 method uses facility-specific emission factors in place of Tier 1 default emission factors. Facility-
specific emission factors are calculated from direct PFC measurement data at the individual facility (either 
continuous or periodic measurements) and are obtained using established measurement practices and protocols – 
refer to analogues guidelines for the aluminium industry (International Aluminium Institute 2006; US 
Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 2008)).   It is good practice to use the Tier 
3 method to estimate PFCs from rare earths when that is a key category. 
For Tier 3, if facility-specific emission factors and production data are available for individual RE metals and 
alloys, then Equation 4.37 can be employed to calculate differentiated PFC emissions for each RE metal/alloy; 
total PFC emissions can be obtained via the summation of these differentiated emissions. However, if 
differentiated emission factors and production data by RE metal/alloy are unavailable, it is acceptable to use 
Equation 4.37 without differentiation of RE metals/alloys produced. 
Given the practical challenges in quantifying very low levels of C3F8, if a Tier-3 facility-specific emission factor 
cannot be determined, it is possible to use a hybrid Tier 1-Tier 3 approach (i.e. Tier 1 emission factor for C3F8; 
Tier 3 emission factors for CF4 and C2F6).

a  For rare earth-iron (RE-Fe) alloys, CF4 default emission factors is based on the average of industrial measurements from production of 
Dy-Fe alloy (1 cell, two measurements from the same facility) in China (Cai et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). Note that the (Zhang et al. 
2018) value of 106 g CF4/tonne RE metal was corrected by dividing out the 57.97% gas collection efficiency measured at the facility by 
(Cai et al. 2018). C2F6 and C3F8 default emission factors were calculated using the CF4 default factor, multiplied by the respective 
C2F6/CF4 and C3F8/CF4 ratio measured by (Cai et al. 2018) for Dy-Fe production. Given that default factors are based on only two data 
points, a higher uncertainty bound +/-99% has been estimated (expert opinion) rather than using the lowest/highest reported emission 
values. 
b  For all other rare earth (Other-RE) metals/alloys, CF4 default emission factors is based on the average of industrial measurements from 
production of: (i) Nd metal (16 cells, one facility) (Zhang et al. 2018), with the value of 26.9 g CF4/tonne metal corrected by dividing out 
the 57.97% gas collection  efficiency measured at the facility by (Cai et al. 2018) and (ii) Pr-Nd alloy (15 cells, 6 cells in two facilities) 
and La metal (6 cells, one facility) in China (Cai et al. 2018). C2F6 and C3F8 default emission factors were calculated using the CF4 
default factor, multiplied by the average C2F6/CF4 and C3F8/CF4 ratio, respectively, measured by (Cai et al. 2018) from Pr-Nd alloy (15 
cells, 6 cells) and La metal (6 cells) production. The uncertainty range is estimated from the lowest/highest emission values from both 
industrial studies.   
c Note that the default factors and uncertainty ranges here have been estimated with very limited sources of measured industrial data. 
Some researchers (Vogel & Friedrich 2018) have estimated PFC emission factors two to three-orders of magnitude greater than the 
default values in this table (modelled ‘medium-emissions’ scenario for Nd production, based on mass balance of NdF3 inputs to replace 
consumed fluorides, but with the unlikely assumption that all consumed fluorides are due to PFC generation). Therefore where possible, 
development and use of Tier 3 facility-specific PFC emission factors is encouraged.

a Uncertainties for facility-specific emission factors have been derived from estimated sampling and gas analysis uncertainties during 
direct industrial measurement of PFCs in rare earth facilities (Cai et al. 2018). Uncertainties for C2F6 and especially C3F8 can be higher, 
particularly when concentrations are close to detection limits of gas measurement systems.  Determination of Tier 3 facility-specific 
emission factors for C3F8 can be challenging and impractical, given the very low detection limits required to quantify these low-level 
emissions. It is possible therefore to use a hybrid Tier 1-Tier 3, where C3F8 emissions are estimated using Tier 1 default factors, and CF4 
and C2F6 using Tier 3, respectively. 
b Uncertainties in facility specific metal production records are expected to be low (i.e. ±10%, based on expert opinion). However (Vogel 
& Friedrich 2018) estimates an uncertainty of up to +40% (+15,000 tonnes) for the 35,000 tonnes estimated global RE metal production 
by fluoride electrolysis in 2015, due to unreported / illegal production of RE metals (Kingsnorth 2015). 
 
4.8.2.5 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Production statistics should be available from every facility to enable use of the Tier 1 methods for both CO2 and 
PFC emissions. Therefore, uncertainty in the tonnes of rare earth metals and alloys produced is likely to be low in 
most countries that have good reporting systems (±10 percent uncertainty, based on expert judgement); other 
sources (Vogel & Friedrich 2018) estimate up to +40 percent uncertainty in global RE metal production (in 2015) 
due to the presence of unreported or illegal RE metal production in some parts of the world. 
For PFC emissions, it is good practice to use Tier 3 facility-specific emission factors for individual facilities, 
where reliable measurements have been taken to establish facility-specific emission factors (i.e. using a method 
similar to that in the USEPA/IAI Protocol for Measurement of CF4 and C2F6 emissions from Primary Aluminium 
Production, 2008).  
For CO2 emissions, it is also good practice to collect data to support Tier 3 methods, which requires facility specific 
information on anode consumption and anode composition to calculate CO2 emissions. 
4.8.2.6 
COMPLETENESS 
Completeness for this source category requires accounting for both CO2 and PFC emissions during the production 
of rare earth metals. Primary RE metal production facilities (by fluoride-electrolysis of REOs) are expected to 
have the information required for these estimates, including records of the tonnes of RE metals produced (both 
total and by individual RE metal/alloy types) throughout the entire time series covered by the inventory. In addition, 
anode consumption data are expected to be available over the same period. Primary RE production (by fluoride-
electrolysis of REOs) also utilizes a high intensity of electricity (per tonne of RE metal); however carbon dioxide 
emissions associated with electricity input are covered separately under Volume 2: Energy.  
Completeness also requires that all rare earth metals production and/or all rare earth metal producers in the country 
be identified. As noted above, some sources have estimated that global RE metal production may have been 
underestimated by 40 percent in 2015 due to unreported or illegal RE metal production in some parts of the world 
(Vogel & Friedrich 2018).

4.8.2.7 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Rare earth metal/alloy production statistics should be available for the entire history of the facility.   
Developing a consistent time series for CO2 emissions should not be a problem since it is expected that most 
facilities have measured and recorded activity data for anode consumption and composition. Where historic anode 
consumption and compositional data are missing, carbon dioxide emissions can be estimated from RE metal 
production utilizing the Tier 1 method. 
Developing a consistent time series for PFC emissions should also be reasonably straightforward as both Tier 1 
and 3 methods utilise metal production statistics to estimate emissions. Backcasting of Tier 3 methods is preferred 
over the use of Tier 1 emission factors. Because PFC emissions have only recently become a focus area of the rare 
earths industry, the majority of facilities do not have further activity data to support any other methodologies (e.g. 
process-data on anode effect performance as per the primary aluminium industry, sub-chapter 4.4.2.3).  
It is good practice to consult with representatives from the operating facilities, either directly or through regional, 
national or international organizations representing the rare earths industry to develop the best strategy for the 
specific group of operating locations included in the national inventory.  
4.8.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
There are major differences in the uncertainty for PFC emissions depending on the choice of Tier 1 or Tier 3 
methods. The differences in uncertainty resulting from the choice of Tier 1 or Tier 3 methods for CO2 emissions 
is smaller, but still significant.  
4.8.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties in CO2 emission factors 
For CO2 emissions, there are major differences in the uncertainty of emissions depending on the choice of Tier 1 
or 3 methods. The overall uncertainty in calculating CO2 emissions from carbon anode consumption for Tier 3 
should be less than ±20 percent, and less than ±30 percent for Tier 1. While Tier 1 default emission factors are 
calculated using the same first principles as Tier 3 (mass-balance assuming all carbon content in the net anode 
consumed is emitted as CO2), there are assumptions for Tier 1 which increases the level of uncertainty. These 
include: (i) an assumed net anode consumption and (ii) assuming zero non-carbon impurities, i.e. 100 percent of 
net anode consumed is in the form of carbon. The use of facility-specific net anode consumption and anode 
compositional data in the Tier 3 method removes the need for these assumptions, leading to lower uncertainty in 
calculating CO2 using Tier 3. This is because the reactions leading to carbon dioxide emissions is reasonably well 
understood and the emissions are very directly connected to the tonnes of RE metal produced through fundamental 
electrochemical equations for REO reduction at the carbon anode and oxidation from thermal processes. Both 
these processes are taken into account when calculating CO2 using net anode consumption and anode 
compositional data.  
Uncertainties in PFC emission factors 
For PFC emissions, there are major reductions in uncertainty when choosing the Tier 3 over the Tier 1 method. 
The high level of uncertainty in the Tier 1 method results from the default emission factors being based on only 
two sets of industrial PFC measurements from rare earth facilities (Cai et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018). Due to the 
limited number of industrial measurements, there is no differentiation of Tier 1 default emission factors for 
different rare earth metals and production technologies, apart from the two generic metal/alloy types: (i) rare earth-
iron (RE-Fe) alloys and (ii) all other rare earth (Other-RE) metals/alloys. In order to achieve lower uncertainty 
using Tier 3 PFC calculations, it is important to use good practices in making facility specific PFC measurements. 
Measurement good practices have been established for the aluminium industry in a protocol available globally 
(International Aluminium Institute 2006; US Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium 
Institute 2008); due to the similarities between the industries, these are recommended as a guiding reference for 
measurements in the rare earths industry, until a RE industry-specific protocol or guideline is established. When 
properly obtained, the Tier 3 coefficients will have an uncertainty of ±10 percent for CF4 and C2F6 and ±35 percent 
for C3F8 at the time coefficients are measured (Cai et al. 2018).

4.8.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
While uncertainties in annual production data for RE metals should be minor (less than ±10 percent), there are 
some reports of unreported/illegal production in parts of the world that amount to ±40 percent of estimated global 
metal production in 2015 (Kingsnorth 2015; Vogel & Friedrich 2018). The uncertainty in recorded carbon anode 
consumption is estimated to be low (less than ±10 percent).  
 
4.8.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
4.8.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice at all primary rare earth metal production facilities to maintain records of all the necessary 
activity data to support calculations of emission factors as suggested in these guidelines. These records will include 
production of rare earth metals (ideally by RE metal/alloy type and by RE technology type) and consumption of 
carbon materials used. It is good practice to aggregate emission estimates from each smelter to estimate total 
national emissions. However, if smelter-level production data is unavailable, smelter capacity data may be used 
along with aggregate national production to estimate smelter production.  
It is good practice to verify facility CO2 emission factors per tonne of RE metal by comparison with the expected 
range of variation that would be predicted from the variation noted in Table 4.26 for CO2 specific emissions. 
Similarly, facility-specific PFC emission factors per tonne RE metal should be compared with the expected range 
of variation noted in Table 4.28. It is suggested that any inventory value outside the expected range of variation 
be confirmed with the data source. 
Use of standard measurement methods improves the consistency of the resulting data and knowledge of the 
statistical properties of the data. Until a rare earths industry-specific guideline or protocol has been established, 
the US EPA ‘Protocol for Measurement of Tetrafluoromethane (CF4) and Hexafluoroethane (C2F6) Emissions 
from Primary Aluminum Production’ (US Environmental Protection Agency & International Aluminium Institute 
2008) is an internationally recognized standard and can be used as a guidance document for obtaining PFC 
emission factors for a rare earths facility, given the similarities between aluminium and rare earths fluoride-
electrolysis processes30. It is good practice to encourage plants to use this method for developing Tier 3 PFC 
emission factors. Significant differences between calculated coefficients based on PFC measurements and the 
industry average Tier 1 emission factors should elicit further review and checks on calculations. Large differences 
should be explained and documented.  
Inter-annual changes in emissions of carbon dioxide per tonne RE metal are not likely to exceed ± 20 percent31 
based on the consistency of the underlying processes that produce carbon dioxide. In contrast, inter-annual changes 
in emissions of PFCs per tonne of RE metal may change by values as much as ±100 percent32. Increases in PFC 
specific emissions can result from process instability or major changes in process conditions, such as unforeseen 
power interruptions, changes in sources of REO feed materials, cell operational problems, and changes in 
amperage to increase RE metal production. Decreases in PFC specific emissions can result from upgrades in cell 
technology such as increasing automation, installation of equipment to continuously feed REO, improved work 
practices and better control of raw materials.  
 
30  Note that unlike the aluminium industry, the Tier 3 methodology for rare earths estimates PFCs using production-based 
emission factors only. The method does not consider more detailed process data, such as anode effect coefficients and 
performance data (as per the Tier 2-3 methodology for accounting PFCs from aluminium in sub-chapter 4.4), due to a lack 
of published data to support it.    
31 Inter-annual variations in CO2 emissions in the analogous aluminium industry (sub-chapter 4.4) typically do not vary more 
than ± 10%; however, given the scarcity of published data, greater variations (i.e. ± 20%) might be allowed for in the rare 
earth industry. 
32 Inter-annual variations in PFC emissions in the analogous aluminium industry (sub-chapter 4.4) typically do not vary more 
than ± 100%; a similar level of variations might be expected in the rare earth industry, as supported by reductions in measured 
emissions over time in one facility (Cai et al. 2018).

REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Internal Documentation and 
Archiving. Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category are provided 
below.  
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. To improve transparency, it is good practice to report 
emissions for PFCs from rare earths production separately from other source categories. Additionally, it is good 
practice that CF4, C2F6 and C3F8 emissions are reported separately on a mass basis.  
The supporting information necessary to ensure transparency in reported emissions estimates is shown in Table 
4.30 below.  
Much of the production and process data are considered proprietary by operators, especially where there is only 
one smelter in a country. It is good practice to exercise appropriate techniques, including aggregation of data, to 
ensure protection of confidential data.
