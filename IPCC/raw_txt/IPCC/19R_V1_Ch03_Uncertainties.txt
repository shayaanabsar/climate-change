3 UNCERTAINTIES 
Users are expected to go to Mapping Tables in Annex 1, before reading this chapter. This is required to correctly 
understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the corresponding chapter 
in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
3.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter provides guidance on estimating and reporting uncertainties associated with both annual estimates of 
emissions and removals, and emission and removal trends over time. It also explains why uncertainty assessment 
is a useful means of improving emission inventories. This guidance is written primarily for inventory compilers 
and provides, with examples, two approaches for combining category uncertainties into uncertainty estimates for 
total national net emissions and trends. 
3.1.1 
Overview of uncertainty analysis 0F1 
Uncertainty assessment is an important part of the effort of compiling an inventory of anthropogenic emissions 
and removals of GHGs (GHG inventory) and to understand changes over time. Since the GPG2000 report, the 
IPCC has adopted the concept of “Good Practice” in developing a GHG inventory. 
In accordance with good practice, estimates should be accurate in the sense that they are neither systematically 
over- nor under-estimating the true emissions or removals, so far as can be judged, and they should be precise so 
far as practicable. 
In the context of national GHG inventories, the purpose of the uncertainty assessment process is to qualitatively 
and quantitatively understand and document the causes of uncertainty in individual estimates and overall totals. 
The outputs of this process capture both accuracy and precision. For every value reported in an inventory there 
will exist an associated uncertainty. Causes of uncertainty are discussed in Section 3.1.5 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines. 
An inventory compiler’s efforts should focus on improving accuracy, meaning that estimation bias should be 
eliminated as far as can be judged. Figure 3.2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines illustrates the difference between 
accuracy and precision, showing that a precise estimate is of limited value if it is not accurate. 
The assessment of uncertainty is most effective while data is being collected and emission or removal estimates 
are calculated. The combination of quantitative uncertainty values is strongly linked to the equations used to 
estimate emissions and removals. Simple methods are based on equations that multiply activity data (AD) by an 
emission factor (EF). More generally, both AD and EF can be the result of several different parameters (see Section 
3.2.3 for a discussion). For some complex methods (e.g., Tier 3), models may be used that involve numerous 
equations and datasets capturing a range of spatial-temporal scales. Regardless of the complexity of the method, 
uncertainty of the results is related to the uncertainties in the data (activity data or emission factors) used in the 
equations. In short, all data collected should have an associated qualitative and quantitative uncertainty assessment 
(see Section 3.2). 
Finally, uncertainty assessment results are not absolute measures of the overall quality of the inventory. Even if 
the uncertainty calculation approach fully captures the complexity of the emission and removal estimation 
equations, the results also reflect the share of sectors and categories in each country (i.e., emission totals for some 
countries contain a larger fraction of emissions from categories that are inherently more uncertain). Nevertheless, 
uncertainty assessment is a useful tool for inventory improvement. Together with the key category analysis, it 
provides information for prioritizing methodological and data collection improvements across source and sink 
categories (see Section 3.1.2). 
 
1 The 2006 IPCC Guidelines use the formulations "uncertainty analysis" and "uncertainty assessment" interchangeably. In this 
report, the formulation "uncertainty assessment" is preferably used, and the term is intended to convey an exercise that 
includes the investigation of quantitative and qualitative aspects. In the glossary to the Guidelines, “uncertainty analysis” is 
defined as only a quantitative exercise. For easier cross-reference with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, however, section titles 
using the term “analysis” have not been changed.

3.1.1a   Uncertainty assessment as part of inventory 
management 
An uncertainty assessment is used by inventory compilers to improve inventories over time. Regardless of the 
framework under which national GHG inventories are developed and reported, inventories are not one-time tasks. 
Inventories are typically reported annually, biennially, or over longer periods and are updated and extended 
between reports. 
Between two reporting occasions, it is good practice to assess the data sources, data flows and methods used. 
Ideally, an inventory will be subject to Quality Assurance (QA) procedures in accordance with guidance provided 
in Chapter 6 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, as well as other review processes (e.g. reviews under the 
UNFCCC). Figure 1.1 in Section 1.1 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines illustrates the steps of a typical 
inventory cycle, and Chapter 1 of this report covers the steps to put in place the institutional arrangements 
necessary to manage the process, including the organization and resources for planning and preparing an inventory. 
Figure 3.1 builds from Figure 3.1 in Chapter 3 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines to show how the 
uncertainty assessment fits in this improvement cycle. 
The process of producing an uncertainty assessment can pragmatically be divided into four parts: (1) the rigorous 
investigation of the likely causes of data uncertainty; (2) the development of quantitative uncertainty estimates and 
parameter correlations; (3) the mathematical combination of those estimates when used as inputs to a statistical 
model (e.g., first-order error propagation or Monte Carlo method); and (4) the selection of inventory improvement 
actions (improvement plan) to take in response to the results of the previous three parts. 
An improvement plan will elaborate the opportunities to improve the inventory and prioritize those opportunities, 
taking into account the information provided in the key category analysis, the uncertainty assessment, the 
recommendations from quality assurance and verification processes (including review process), and resources 
available. 
Particularly in relation to the uncertainty assessment, the improvement plan will investigate ways to reduce biases 
that have been identified and ways to enhance precision for categories with high contribution to the overall 
uncertainty of the inventory.

3.1.2 
Overall structure of uncertainty analysis 
As part of an inventory planning process, an improvement plan will identify the emission and removal categories 
for which changes are to be implemented in future inventories. These improvements will likely address 
methodological choice, as well as data specification, availability and collection. For example, a typical 
improvement will focus on getting better data for the same methodology (e.g. collecting country-specific data). 
The goal of an improvement plan is to increase the quality of the inventory. 
Figure 4.1 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines shows the steps of methodology choice, which depend on 
the target category for improvement, data availability, and resources requirements. 
Figure 3.1a shows the general steps of an uncertainty assessment. It is important to note the strong link among 
these steps, especially between the data specification and collection steps and between the data collection and the 
quantification of data uncertainty steps. 
When assessing data uncertainty, it is essential to identify the causes of uncertainty. In particular, priority should 
be given to identifying causes of bias, as well as potential ways to correct those biases. 
Following the assessment of the uncertainty in input data used in emissions/removals estimation (e.g. activity data 
and emission factors), the next step is to combine or propagate the quantitative uncertainty estimates for these 
parameters to produce an uncertainty estimate for the source or sink category. Then these uncertainty values can 
be combined across all categories to determine the overall uncertainty of the total national net emissions in the 
inventory. 
There are two approaches presented in these guidelines for combining uncertainty values. Figure 3.1a shows a 
simple scheme for choosing which approach to select, although it is important to note that hybrid approaches are 
possible where the propagation technique varies among categories. It is also important to note that even when 
requirements for application of approach 1 are not fully present it still can provide useful information about the 
uncertainty of the inventory. Because of its simplicity when compared with Approach 2, it is recommended to also 
apply Approach 1 as a quality assurance / quality control (QA/QC) tool when applying Approach 2.

3.1.3 
Key concepts and terminology 
Definitions associated with conducting an uncertainty analysis include uncertainty, accuracy, precision and 
variability. These terms are sometimes used loosely and may be misunderstood. They have in fact clear statistical 
definitions that should be used in order to be clear about what is being quantified and reported. Several definitions 
are given here, in alphabetical order: 
Accuracy: Agreement between the true value and the average of repeated measured observations or estimates of a 
variable. An accurate measurement or prediction lacks bias or, equivalently, systematic error.  
Bias: Lack of accuracy. Bias (systematic error), can occur because of failure to capture all relevant processes 
involved or because the available data are not representative of all real-world situations, or because of instrument 
error. 
Confidence Interval (CI): A type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed/estimated data, 
that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. The interval has an associated confidence 
level that quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies in the interval. Most commonly, the 95 percent 
confidence level is used. 
Precision: Agreement among repeated measurements of the same variable. Better precision means less random 
error. Precision is independent of accuracy. 
 
Chapter 3: Uncertainties 
 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.9 
Probability density function (PDF): A function, whose value at any given sample (or point) in the sample space 
(the set of possible values taken by the random variable) can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that 
the value of the random variable would equal that sample. 
Random errors: Random variation above or below a mean value. Random error is inversely proportional to 
precision. Usually, the random error is quantified with respect to a mean value, but the mean could be biased or 
unbiased. Thus, random error is a distinct concept compared to systematic error. 
Systematic error: Another term for bias, which refers to lack of accuracy. 
Uncertainty: Lack of knowledge of the true value of a variable that can be described as a PDF characterising the 
range and likelihood of possible values. Uncertainty depends on the analyst’s state of knowledge, which in turn 
depends on the quality and quantity of applicable data as well as knowledge of underlying processes and inference 
methods. 
Variability: Heterogeneity of a variable over time, space or members of a population (Morgan and Henrion 1990; 
Cullen and Frey 1999). Variability may arise, for example, due to differences in design from one emitter to another 
(inter-plant or spatial variability) and in operating conditions from one time to another at a given emitter (intra-
plant variability). Variability is an inherent property of the system or of nature, and not of the analyst.

Inventories should be accurate in the sense that they are neither over- nor underestimated as far as can be judged, 
and precise as far as practicable. Figure 3.2 provides a conceptual comparison of accuracy and precision. An 
accurate inventory is one that is free of bias but that could be precise or imprecise. A precise inventory may appear 
to have low uncertainty but if the inventory is inaccurate, then the inventory systematically over- or under-
estimates the true emissions or removals. Inaccuracy, or bias, can occur because of failure to capture all relevant 
emissions or removal processes or because the available data are not representative of real-world situations. There 
is no predetermined level of precision, in part because of the inherent variability of some categories.

3.1.6 
Reducing uncertainty 
Uncertainties should be reduced as far as is practicable during the process of compiling an inventory, and it is 
particularly important to ensure that the model and the data collected are fair representations of the real world. 
When focusing efforts to reduce uncertainty, priority should be given to those inputs to the inventory that have the 
most impact on the overall uncertainty of the inventory, as opposed to inputs that are of minor or negligible 
importance to the assessment as described in Chapter 4, Methodological Choice and Identification of Key 
Categories. Tools for prioritising where uncertainties should be reduced include key category analysis (see Chapter 
4) and assessment of the contribution of uncertainties in specific categories to the total uncertainty in the inventory 
 
 
Volume 1: General Guidance and Reporting 
 
 
 
 
3.10 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(see Section 3.2.3). Depending on the cause of uncertainty present, uncertainties could be reduced in seven broad 
ways:  
• Improving conceptualisation: Improving the inclusiveness of the structural assumptions chosen can reduce 
uncertainties. An example is better treatment of seasonality effects that leads to more accurate annual estimates 
of emissions or removals for the AFOLU Sector.  
• Improving models: Improving the model structure and parameterisation can lead to better understanding and 
characterisation of the systematic and random errors, as well as reductions in these causes of uncertainty.  
• Improving representativeness: This may involve stratification or other sampling strategies, as set out in Section 
3.2.1.2. This is particularly important for categories in the agriculture, forestry and land use parts of an inventory, 
but also applies elsewhere, e.g., wherever different technologies are operating within a category. For example, 
continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) can be used to reduce uncertainty for some sources and gases 
as long as the representativeness is guaranteed. CEMS produces representative data at the facilities where it is 
used, but in order to be representative of an entire source category, CEMS data must be available for a sample or 
an entire set of individual facilities that comprise the category. When using CEMS both GHG emissions 
concentration and flow will vary, requiring simultaneous observations of both attributes.  
• Using more precise measurement methods: Measurement error can be reduced by using more precise 
measurement methods, avoiding simplifying assumptions, and ensuring that measurement technologies are 
appropriately used and calibrated. See Chapter 2, Approaches to Data Collection. 
• Collecting more data that are measured: Uncertainty associated with random sampling error can be reduced 
by increasing the sample size. Both bias and random error can be reduced by filling in data gaps. This applies 
both to measurements and surveys. 
• Eliminating known risk of bias: This is achieved by ensuring instrumentation is properly positioned and 
calibrated (see Section 2.2 in Chapter 2), models or other estimation procedures are appropriate and 
representative as indicated by the decision trees and other advice on methodological choice in sectoral volumes, 
and by applying expert judgements in a systematic way.  
• Improving state of knowledge: Generally, improving the understanding of the categories and the processes 
leading to emissions and removals can help to discover, and correct for, problems of incompleteness. It is good 
practice to continuously improve emissions and removal estimates based on new knowledge (see Chapter 5, 
Time Series Consistency). 
• Moving to higher tier method: For example, Tier 1 emission factors that are considered global defaults may be 
biased when they are applied in a specific country where emission rates deviate by significant amounts from 
global defaults. Moving to a higher tier method in these cases will likely increase accuracy. Applying a higher 
tier method may also improve the precision of estimates, as shown in Box 3.0. 
The effort to reduce uncertainty is also one that is tightly integrated with data collection and QA/QC processes. In 
many ways, uncertainty assessment is an in-depth approach to quality management. Both uncertainty assessment 
and QA/QC processes require rigorous investigation into the causes of data quality problems, especially ones that 
general QC checks are unlikely to identify. These problems will often involve issues of incomplete data or other 
systematic biases in the data, which also happen to be key issues for developing a quantitative uncertainty analysis 
(Gillenwater et al. 2007). 
Both QA/QC and uncertainty assessment are part of a learning process. While the uncertainty assessment provides 
a quantification of inventory uncertainty, its primary function is to understand what causes uncertainty and how to 
improve inventory quality. Conversely, the outcome of QA/QC procedures may result in a reassessment of 
individual category or parameter uncertainty estimates (e.g. if new systematic biases in data are identified). 
Procedures to check quality and analyse uncertainties should work together because both processes are intended 
to understand the causes of uncertainty and identify potential areas of improvement (US EPA 2002).

BOX 3.0 (NEW) 
EXAMPLE OF REDUCING UNCERTAINTY IN A CATEGORY BY ADOPTING HIGHER TIER METHODS 
Mineral soil C stock changes for Cropland Remaining Cropland have been estimated with all three 
methodological tiers for the United States, and this box provides information about how uncertainty 
has been reduced by moving to higher tiers. A Monte Carlo Analysis for propagating uncertainties 
addressing key dependencies in the underlying data, such as the relationship among the land use 
areas, was used for each methodological tier. As with other source categories, the Tier 1 method is 
relatively simple with default emission factors provided in the IPCC guidance, but does require 
compilation of activity data for a simple classification of lands, climate and soils. The 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines provide uncertainties in emission factors, while uncertainties in land use and 
management data were derived from the survey data used in the inventory. For example, land use 
data were based on a two-stage survey design used to derive joint probability distributions for land 
use and land use change over the inventory time series. By moving to Tier 2, the compilers derived 
country-specific emission factors (i.e. stock change factors) based on experimental data from the 
region (Ogle et al. 2003). Specifically, the new factors were derived using a linear mixed-effect 
modelling approach from 46 experiments evaluating the effect of tillage management on soil carbon, 
19 experiments evaluating the impact of variation in carbon input to soils, and 35 experiments 
evaluating the impact of land use change between native conditions and long-term cultivation. 
Compilers also had the option of refining the land representation and activity data into a country-
specific set of climate and soil types, in addition to management classes. However, the compilers 
did not change the classification in this application, and so the uncertainties in activity data were the 
same for the Tier 1 and 2 methods. Regardless, flexibility in deriving new emission factors improved 
the precision of the estimates, reducing the 95 percent confidence interval for the estimated soil C 
stock changes from ±59% of the estimate using the Tier 1 method to a ±40% for the Tier 2 method 
(see Figure 3.2a, US EPA 2017). 
The compilers further developed the inventory for Cropland Remaining Cropland with a Tier 3 
method. This method was based on the Century Ecosystem Model, and later the DayCent Ecosystem 
Model (Ogle et al. 2010; US EPA 2017). These models incorporate a more mechanistic 
representation of the processes influencing soil organic matter dynamics, including water flows 
through the soil, crop production, organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling (Parton et al. 
1987). With a more advanced representation of processes, the inventory was able to capture a broader 
suite of drivers influencing the change in soil carbon stocks. In addition, the inventory incorporated 
more detailed information on activity data and environmental variables, such as weather, soils, and 
management practices. There were additional uncertainties associated with these activity data, such 
as the variability in specific nitrogen fertilisation rates. Several of the main datasets, however, such 
as land use and cropping histories, did not differ across the three methods. In theory, Tier 3 methods 
allow compilers to develop a methodology that is more specific to national circumstances and in 
keeping with good practice. To address uncertainties in the emission rates (i.e., analogous to the 
emission factors for the Tier 1 and 2 methods), the compilers evaluated uncertainty in the 
Century/DayCent model predictions of soil carbon stock changes by comparing results to 
independent measurement data. They used these data comparisons to develop an empirical model to 
adjust for biases and assess precision in the inventory results (Ogle et al. 2007). More details about 
the uncertainty analysis are provided in Volume 4, Chapter 2, Box 2.2H. The Tier 3 inventory further 
constrained 95 percent confidence intervals in soil carbon stock change estimates over 5 years from 
a ±40% with the Tier 2 method to ±16% for the Tier 3 method (see Figure 3.2a). 
Incorporating data specific to a country for estimating Tier 2 emission factors will better represent 
the range of cropland fields in the country. Tier 1 default factors are based on samples from a larger 
global population of fields, which has considerably more variation in climates, soils and other 
variables driving soil organic matter dynamics, and all of this variation is not relevant for an 
individual country. Of course, the accuracy of the Tier 2 factors also depends on an adequate sample 
of emission measurements in a country. For the Tier 3 method, the compilers incorporated scientific 
understanding of soil organic matter dynamics using the Century/DayCent model, which embodies 
key processes and structure that influence soil carbon stock changes. In turn, the compilers could 
estimate management impacts on soil carbon stock changes with more specificity to physical and 
biogeochemical conditions of the plant-soil environments in the country than is possible with the 
lower tier methods.

QUANTIFYING UNCERTAINTIES 
The quantification of uncertainty will be based on the input data used in the methodology equations. The overall 
uncertainty of the emissions/removals will depend on the uncertainty associated with each data variable and parameter 
used. As such, good practice uncertainty assessment begins with good practice in data collection. Uncertainty 
consideration will need to be an integral part of the data collection effort, including selection of data sources and 
choice of methods following the guidance in Chapter 2 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
Section 3.2 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines covers the different techniques for quantifying uncertainties, 
which depend on the availability of information and data collection approaches. These include measured data, 
published information, model outputs, and expert judgement. At time, the pragmatic approach will be a combination 
of the techniques. 
Again, it is good practice to follow the procedures for QA/QC according to Chapter 6 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines. These procedures are fundamental in preventing mistakes and misreporting and misclassification errors 
and approach deviations.  
Ultimately, the measure of uncertainty will be a 95 percent confidence interval around a point estimate for the value. 
To develop this information a PDF will be associated with each quantity. The development of that PDF is an essential 
part of the uncertainty assessment. Section 3.2.2.4 of Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines provide guidance on 
how to select the form of PDF. The representativeness of the PDF will depend on the characteristics of the quantity, 
including domain (e.g., if it can have both positive or negative values, or only non-negative values), range (e.g., is the 
range narrow or does it cover orders-of-magnitude) and shape (e.g., symmetry). The same characteristics will be 
fundamental when the approaches for combining uncertainties are selected. 
Where the PDF is believed to be symmetrical, the confidence interval can be conveniently expressed as plus or minus 
half the confidence interval width divided by the estimated value of the variable (e.g., ±10%). Where the PDF is not 
symmetrical, the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval need to be specified separately (e.g., -30%, +50%). 
In both cases, the understanding is that the confidence interval has a 95 percent probability of enclosing the true but 
unknown value of the emission factor, parameter, or activity data. 
Box 3.0a provides some examples of appropriate estimators that the inventory compiler could use, within typical 
circumstances and available data, for uncertainty evaluation.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STANDARD DEVIATION AND STANDARD ERROR 
The following formulas may be chosen by an inventory compiler to evaluate the uncertainty of a 
parameter.  
A 95 percent confidence interval may be derived considering either the standard deviation (σ) or the 
standard error (SE) around the estimated parameter (µ).  
Under the assumption that values are normally distributed, the uncertainty of the estimate may be

* “n” is used instead of “n-1” as an approximation for large samples. 
Some considerations may help the inventory compiler choose between these two approaches. 
The standard deviation of a sample can be used to estimate the variability of the population from 
which the sample was drawn. For data with a normal distribution, about 95 percent of individuals 
will have values within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean, the other 5 percent being equally 
scattered above and below these limits. 
When the sample mean is known, the inventory compiler is usually not ultimately interested in the 
mean of that particular sample, but in the mean of the population from which the sample is drawn. 
For instance, for a sectoral category of the inventory, in order to estimate a specific parameter (e.g. 
emission factor, carbon stock change factor or AD), data are usually collected with the aim to 
generalize from them and use the sample mean as an estimate of the average parameter for the whole 
category. 
The sample mean will vary from sample to sample; the way this variation occurs is described by the 
“sampling distribution” of the mean. The variability of the mean is calculated using the standard 
deviation of this sampling distribution, which is defined as the standard error of the mean. 
The standard error falls as the sample size increases whereas the standard deviation will tend to 
remain the same. 
In summary, to calculate the uncertainty of a given parameter, the first step is to establish if the 
parameter (e.g. the mean value) is used to estimate an individual of the population (for example the 
case of using the average C stock of forest land to estimate the C stock of a specific stand of trees, 
or a subcategory if the forest land is stratified into forest types) or the entire population (when using 
the average C stock of forest land to estimate the C stock of the entire forest land category).

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STANDARD DEVIATION AND STANDARD ERROR 
In the first case, the variability (i.e. how much population values are spread) is measured using the 
standard deviation. In the second case the variability (i.e. how much the mean values of the samples 
taken from the population are spread), is measured using the standard error. 
The following examples are provided for emission factors:  
Case 1. 
Availability of annual information to derive country-specific emission factors of a specific 
category/gas/fuel.  
Data are collected yearly from the whole population or a representative sample(s) of the relevant 
category.  
This situation may occur when data are collected from facilities. 
In this case, the annual emission factor is calculated as the average emission factor from repeated 
measurements in specific years and may change over the years. Inventory compilers are interested 
in the variability of this average annual value. 
Assuming a normal distribution of the data collected, the 95 percent confidence interval may be 
expressed with the standard error and the uncertainty of the estimated emission factor as:  
Uncertainty =

Case 2. 
Availability of irregular information during the years used to derive country-specific emission 
factors of a specific category/gas/fuel.  
Data are not regularly collected and the result of data collected for one single year for a specific 
category, which well characterizes the population, is applied to a longer period of the time series.   
This situation may occur when data are sporadically collected from facilities, e.g. methane emissions 
and relevant activity data and parameters from landfills. 
In this case, the 95 percent confidence intervals can be calculated using the standard deviation of the 
point estimate because, assuming the value is representative of other years, the variability of the 
population has to be considered. The uncertainty will be:

specific value is applied to a specific area, e.g. carbon stock per hectare of deforested area.

UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVITY DATA 
Activity data are often more closely linked to economic activity than are emission factors are. However, unlike 
emission factor data, there is typically no statistical sample of alternative activity data estimates readily available 
to fit distributions and estimate uncertainty. There are often well-established price incentives and fiscal 
requirements for accurate accounting of economic activity. Activity data therefore tend to have lower uncertainties 
and a lower correlation between years than emission factor data. Activity data are often collected and published 
regularly by national statistical agencies, which may have already assessed the uncertainties associated with their 
data as part of their data collection procedures. These previously developed uncertainty estimates can be used to 
construct PDFs. This information will not necessarily have been published, so it is recommended to contact the 
statistical agencies directly. Since economic activity data are not usually collected for the purpose of estimating 
greenhouse gas emissions and removals, it is good practice to assess the applicability of the uncertainty estimates 
before using them.   
There are several approaches that may be helpful in assessing the uncertainty of activity data in particular 
circumstances: 
Activity data based on complete samples (censuses): Census data are based, in principle, on counting every 
instance of a particular activity. A census may include systematic and random errors. Systematic errors arise 
through systematic undercounting or overcounting. For example, undercounting may occur due to non-responses 
from a sub-group of individuals with characteristics and behaviour that differ from other individuals of the 
population, which may lead to bias. Random errors are typically the sum of a range of commonplace errors. 
Random errors usually can be expected to be normally distributed and serially uncorrelated. Because activity data 
are usually collected by the same people, using the same processes, for each observation, systematic errors are 
likely to take approximately the same value each year. There are several approaches to identifying the potential 
uncertainty of activity data for complete samples. These approaches are often an integrated part of a QA/QC plan: 
• To check for the size of random errors, look for fluctuations over time, and differential fluctuations in series 
that ought to be highly correlated with the data of interest. 
Volume 1: General Guidance and Reporting 
 
 
 
 
3.16 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• To check for bias errors, cross-check the data of interest with other, related information. One might, for instance, 
look up and down the supply chain for fuels, comparing coal production, coal import/export, and reported 
consumption. Or, one might study activities for which data are collected independently but which ought to be 
highly correlated with the data of interest, for instance reported fuel input vs. electricity output. One might also 
look at activity data of different frequencies (e.g., monthly, annual), if they are collected using different 
approaches. 
• Interpretation of statistical differences, within, for instance, national energy data is an example of cross-
checking. The comparison between energy-related carbon dioxide emissions derived from the IPCC reference 
approach is a formal cross-check with emissions estimates derived from other sources. 
Census-based activity data are often ‘precise but inaccurate’ in the taxonomy shown in Figure 3.2, the random 
errors are small, but there may be larger bias errors. Cross-checking can suggest upper and lower bounds for 
possible bias errors, and sometimes will permit an actual estimate of the bias error. A possible bias error lurking 
within these bounds may often be characterised as a truncated uniform distribution: cross-checking shows that the 
unobservable true value must lie within a particular range, but there may be no reason to think any point within 
that range is more or less likely. However, because the bias errors in activity data are likely to be highly correlated, 
the difference between the reported value and the unknown true value is likely to be about the same every year, 
and this characteristic should be taken into account when estimating trend uncertainty. 
Activity data based on random samples: Some kinds of activity data are derived from sample surveys, for instance 
consumer surveys, land use surveys, or forest cover surveys. The agency conducting the sample will normally be 
able to advise on sampling error. If this information is unavailable, it may be possible to identify or infer the sample 
and population sizes and calculate sampling error directly. 
The most common survey designs are simple random sampling, systematic sampling, stratified sampling, and two-
stage sampling. For a simple random sampling design, a sample of n elements is selected without replacement 
from a population of N total elements with equal probability. For example, a survey may sample the fuel usage 
from 2,000,000 vehicles in a country with 80,000,000 total vehicles by randomly selecting vehicles to be included 
in the sample. Each sampled vehicle is multiplied by a weight of 40 (i.e., total number of vehicles divided by the 
number that are sampled) and summed to estimate the total fuel usage. This design is commonly used when there 
is little additional information known about the population.  
With systematic sampling, an initial sample element is randomly selected then subsequent sampling elements are 
selected at equal increments, such as geographic distances apart. For example, a survey may be determining the 
amount of biomass C in forestlands by sampling 50 forest stands from a population 1000 stands in a country. A 
random location is selected for the first sample, and then additional samples are spaced at 20 km apart across all 
of the forestland in a country. The biomass C for each of the sampled forest stands is multiplied by a weight of 20 
in this example (total number of forest stands divided by the number in the sample), and then summed to obtain 
the total biomass C for forestlands in the country. Systematic sampling is used to ensure a wide dispersion of 
samples in a geographical region.  
Stratified sampling designs subdivide population into separate groups, referred to as strata. An individual stratum 
may be sampled using simple random sampling or systematic sampling. The differences among strata should be 
as heterogeneous as possible, whilst the subpopulation within a stratum should be as homogeneous as possible. 
For example, farms may be sampled to determine the amount of livestock manure N production by stratifying the 
farms according to the production systems in a country, which could be based on livestock types, products (e.g., 
meat, eggs, milk or other products), manure management practices, or other relevant criteria. For this example, 
assume that there are 15 production systems with 100 farms in each production system for a total of 1500 farms. 
If 10 farms are sampled in each production system, then the total amount of manure N production for each 
production system is estimated by multiplying each farm’s value by a weight of 10 (total number of farms in a 
stratum, i.e., production system, divided by the number of farms in the sample for the stratum). The national total 
is the sum of the manure N production for the 15 production systems. In addition, individual stratum can have 
different sample sizes, and the weight would change in this case based on the total number of farms and number 
sampled in each stratum. 
With a two-stage sampling design, the population is first divided into primary sampling units, and each primary 
sampling unit is further divided into secondary sampling units. The primary sampling units are typically selected 
using simple random sampling, stratified or systematic sampling, while secondary sampling units within the 
sampled primary sampling units are typically selected using simple random sampling. Total estimates are made 
for each primary sampling unit, and then combined to estimate the total for the entire population. For example, the 
amount of waste transported to landfills may be determined by creating primary sampling units based on random 
selection of provinces, and then municipalities within provinces are randomly selected for the secondary sampling 
units. The total amount of waste is determined for the individual provinces in the first step given the total number 
of municipalities in a province and the number of municipalities that are sampled. In the second step, the total

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.17 
waste production for the entire country is determined based on the total number of provinces and the number of 
provinces that are sampled. This type of sampling design may be the best approach for optimizing the precision of 
activity data with limited funding.  
All of these designs have standard formulas that can be used to derive variances in the resulting estimates for the 
activity data (e.g., see Särndal et al. 1992). The estimated variances can be converted into probability distribution 
functions for the activity data and used to propagate uncertainty through the emissions calculations with guidance 
provided in Section 3.2.3 of this chapter.

Methods to combine uncertainties 
This section further elaborates on the two approaches to combine uncertainties presented in Section 3.2.3 of the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines: Approach 1, simple propagation of error equations, and Approach 2, Monte Carlo 
simulation. A tool for the implementation of Approach 1 is also included as an addendum.  
Once the uncertainties in activity data, emission factor or other parameters for a category have been determined, 
they may be combined to provide uncertainty estimates for the category emissions. Once these have been 
determined, they may be combined to provide uncertainty estimates for the total national net emissions in any year 
and the overall inventory trend over time.  
Two approaches for the estimation of combined uncertainties are presented in the following sections: Approach 1 
uses simple error propagation equations, while Approach 2 uses Monte Carlo or similar techniques. Either 
Approach may be used for emission sources or sinks, subject to the assumptions and limitations of each Approach 
and availability of resources. 
Figure 3.1a in Section 3.1.2 shows a basic step-by-step process for choosing an approach. In practice, however, 
the options are not always straightforward. 
Approach 1 is simpler to apply but requires assumptions that frequently are not entirely met, such as lack of 
significant correlations among the quantities used in the inventory, uncertainties that are less than ±30% of the 
quantity value or uncertainties that are symmetrically distributed. Approach 2 requires more information on the 
probability distributions of the data involved in the calculations. As such, it also involves assumptions and more 
information on the underlying processes and its application depends on the capacity to acquire this information. 
In turn, Approach 2 may provide a more representative confidence interval for the uncertainty in the category. 
Approach 2 will be particularly appropriate to use when uncertainties are large, their distribution are non-Gaussian, 
and algorithms are complex functions. 
3.2.3.1 APPROACH 1: PROPAGATION OF ERROR 
Approach 1 is based upon error propagation and is used to estimate uncertainty in individual categories, in the 
inventory as a whole, and in trends between a year of interest and a base year. The key assumptions, requirements, 
and procedures are described here.  
Approach 1 should be implemented using Table 3.1, Approach 1 Uncertainty Calculation. A tool set up on a 
commercial spreadsheet software is provided, as an addendum to this chapter, to facilitate the implementation of 
Table 3.1. The table is completed at the category level using uncertainty ranges for activity data and emission 
factors consistent with the sectoral good practice guidance1F2. Different gases should be entered separately as CO2 
 
2 Where estimates are derived from models, enter the uncertainty associated with the activity data used to drive the model, and 
enter the uncertainty associated with the model parameters instead of the emission factor uncertainty. It may be necessary to 
use expert judgement, or error propagation calculations associated with the model structure. If it is impractical to separate 
the uncertainty estimate obtained from a model for a category into separate activity and emission factor components, then 
enter the total uncertainty for the category in the emission factor column and assign zero uncertainty to the activity factor 
column.

equivalents. Categories should be disaggregated to the level where methodologies are applied and AD and EF are 
estimated, unless correlation between the subcategories exist. 
KEY ASSUMPTIONS OF APPROACH 1 
In Approach 1 uncertainty in emissions or removals can be propagated from uncertainties in the activity data, 
emission factor and other estimation parameters through the error propagation equation (Mandel 1984; Bevington 
and Robinson 1992). If correlations exist, then either the correlation can be included explicitly or data can be 
aggregated to an appropriate level such that correlations become less important. Approach 1 also theoretically 
requires that the standard deviation divided by the mean value is less than 0.3. In practice, however, the approach 
will give informative results even if this criterion is not strictly met and some correlations remain. Approach 1 
assumes that the relative ranges of uncertainty in the emission and activity factors are the same in the base year 
and in year t. This assumption is often correct or approximately correct. If any of the key assumptions of Approach 
1 do not apply, then either an alternative version of Approach 1 can be developed (e.g., see Section 3.4) or 
Approach 2 can be used instead. 
Where the standard deviation divided by the mean is greater than 0.3 the reliability of Approach 1 can be improved. 
The Section 3.7.3 ‘Dealing with Large and Asymmetric Uncertainties in the Results of Approach 1’ of the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines describes how to do this. 
KEY REQUIREMENTS OF APPROACH 1 
To quantify uncertainty using Approach 1, estimates of the uncertainty for each input are required, as well as the 
equation through which all inputs are combined to estimate an output. The simplest equations include statistically 
independent (uncorrelated) inputs. When inputs are known to be fully (or mostly) correlated, modified equations 
should be used or a preliminary step should be performed to combine these inputs before the application of the 
basic rules. 
Uncertainty of the inputs will represent a 95 percent confidence interval expressed as a percentage of the point 
estimate of the input (e.g. ± 20%). When the probability distribution function is known to be asymmetrical, upper 
and lower limits of the confidence interval need to be specified separately (e.g., -10 %, +20%). In this case, 
Approach 1 will provide only a rough approximation and in order to be used the interval needs to be replaced by 
a symmetrical interval built using the larger of the two quantities (e.g. ±20%). When uncertainties are known to 
be large and asymmetrical, more elaborated techniques may be applied as described in Section 3.7.3 of the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines. 
PROCEDURE OF APPROACH 1 
The Approach 1 analysis estimates uncertainties by using the error propagation equation in two steps. First, the 
Equation 3.1 approximation is used to combine emission factor, activity data and other estimation parameter ranges 
by category and greenhouse gas. Second, the Equation 3.2 approximation is used to arrive at the overall uncertainty 
in national emissions and the trend in national emissions between the base year and the current year. 
Uncertainty of an Annual Estimate 
The error propagation equation2F3 yields two convenient rules for combining uncorrelated uncertainties under 
addition and multiplication: 
Where uncertain quantities are to be combined by multiplication a simple equation (Equation 3.1) can then be 
derived for the uncertainty of the product, expressed in percentage terms. This rule is approximate for all random 
variables. Under typical circumstances, this rule is reasonably accurate as long as the percentage uncertainty is 
less than approximately 30%. This rule is not applicable to division.

The GHG Inventory is principally the sum of products of emission factors, activity data and other estimation 
parameters. Therefore, Equations 3.1 and 3.2 can be used repeatedly to estimate the uncertainty of the total 
inventory. In practice, uncertainties found in inventory categories vary from a few percent to orders of magnitude 
and may be correlated. This is not consistent with the assumptions of Equations 3.1 and 3.2 that the variables are 
uncorrelated, and with the assumption of Equation 3.2 that the coefficient of variation is less than about 30 percent, 
but under these circumstances, Equations 3.1 and 3.2 may still be used to obtain an approximate result. 
Applying Approach 1 (level) in practice 
Simple methods for estimation of the emissions of a category are usually based on the multiplication of activity 
data (AD) by an emission factor (EF). In many cases, it will be a reasonable assumption that these values are 
uncorrelated. The uncertainty associated with the emissions can then be calculated by Equation 3.2a:

More generally, both AD and EF can be the result of several different parameters and this frequently occurs for 
the EF (e.g. EF = a • b • c). The uncertainty of the EF will be calculated as:

The uncertainties associated with the emissions for each subcategory will be combined to obtain the uncertainty 
associated with a whole category and further combined to obtain the uncertainty of the whole inventory. In these 
steps, the uncertainties are combined through addition and therefore Equation 3.2 should be applied. 
Particular attention should be given to the correlation in this step. The subcategories can be highly correlated, 
because either the AD are derived from the same source or the EFs have parameters in common. A special situation 
occurs when an input is entirely dependent on a set of other inputs. As noted in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines this 
could occur, for example, if residential fuel is estimated as the difference between total consumption and usage in 
the transportation, industrial, and commercial sectors. Similarly, in the AFOLU sector, when land transitions are 
assessed, total area transitions depend on the total area of the country, resulting in less degrees of freedom for the 
variables. 
 
4 The option for expressing uncertainties in percent terms allows the results to be presented in a user-friendly way. However, 
caution should be exercised in the interpretation of the results in cases where the point estimate is very small when compared 
with the size of the confidence interval (e.g. a sector or inventory where removals and emissions are of similar sizes). 
Moreover, in the unique case the sum of negative quantities is equal to the sum of positive ones, the denominator in the 
Equation 3.2 is equal to "0" and the formula has no sense.

Approach 1 has limitations to the consideration of correlation as it only allows for full correlation or independency 
between the variables. Still broad sensibility can be implemented, either for correlation between variables in the 
same year or different years. This flexibility is included in the tool for the implementation of Approach 1 included 
in the addendum. It is important to note that in the case of full correlation among categories, aggregation of these 
categories is the recommended procedure. When information is lacking for either uncertainties of AD or EF for 
subcategories of a category, pre-processing by expert judgement may be necessary to either provide individual 
values to the subcategories or recommend their aggregation. Where partial correlations are known to exist and are 
relevant, Approach 2 is recommended.

Essentially, by these equations, the CH4 emissions are estimated by a sum of products of parameters 
and, as such, Equations 3.1 and 3.2 apply and could be successively used, always under usual 
assumptions. The parameters may be classified as AD or EF, although this is not really necessary 
and sometimes artificial.   
To estimate the uncertainty, a point estimate and a confidence interval are necessary for each of the 
parameters. In some cases, it may be difficult to develop simple confidence intervals, particularly in 
cases where calculations are not linear (e.g. when using the gross energy intake (GE) from the 
agricultural enteric fermentation Tier 2). As an example, the formulas are applied for the Tier 1 
method for calculation of methane emissions from manure management from dairy cows. Data are 
from Volume 4, Chapter 10 and Monni et al. 2007. Three types of manure management systems 
(pasture, slurry and solid storage) are considered.

BOX 3.1A (NEW) (CONTINUED) 
EXAMPLE OF UNCERTAINTY CALCULATION: CH4 EMISSIONS FROM MANURE MANAGEMENT 
It is important to note that AWMS fractions are not independent quantities (as AWMS1+AWMS2 
+AWMS3=1). Before calculating the uncertainty, AWMSdairy,3 needs to be replaced by  
(1–AWMSdairy,1–AWMSdairy,2). 
The terms of the resulting equation will not be all independent and this contradicts the assumptions 
behind Equations 3.1 and 3.2. To correctly consider the correlation between the values of AWMSi, 
Approach 2 is recommended to be used. Nonetheless, due to the overwhelming effect of liquid 
manure management systems in the calculation of the emission factor, in this case, the simplifying 
assumption can be applied. 
The results of application of Approach 1 are shown below: 
Point estimates for CH4: 
CH4,pasture = 0.09 Gg 
CH4,slurry  = 4.61 Gg 
CH4,solid = 0.82 Gg 
CH4,Total 
= 5.53 Gg

To compare this result with the result of Approach 2, two cases of Monte Carlo simulation have 
been developed, assuming normal distribution for all parameters. In the first case, the correlation 
between the share of systems (AWMS) was disregarded. In the second case, the correlation between 
the systems was taken into consideration. The results obtained were: 
Case without correlations: UMC = 37.21 
Case with correlations: UMC2 = 36.41 
 
The results show that if correlation is disregarded the uncertainty result is higher than when the 
correlation is considered and that in this example, Approach 1 underestimates the uncertainty. 
It is interesting to note that, although the result of Approach 2 will be more accurate than the result 
of Approach 1, the result of Approach 1, in this example, is not too far apart from the result of 
Approach 2 due to the minor role of the two AWMS systems that were correlated in the calculation 
of the emission factor. However, this will not always be the case, depending on the data and their 
distribution. Nevertheless, Approach 1 would still qualify as a tool for QA/QC and for helping in  
prioritizing improvements to the inventory if there are not enough data and resources for using 
Approach 2.

Uncertainty in the Trend 
The trend of the net emissions of a category is expressed as a percentage calculated in relation to the emissions in 
the base year. The uncertainty in the trend will be a function of the uncertainties of the emissions in both the base 
year and the current year. As a direct consequence, the uncertainty of the trend will be a function of the 
uncertainties of the activity data and the emission factors at both these points in time. 
Similar to the level uncertainty, Approach 1 for the trend uncertainty applies a simple propagation method based 
on the uncertainties of the input data (activity data and emission factors) for both the base year and the current 
year. In addition to the assumptions already described, the approach for calculating the trend uncertainty requires 
assumptions on data correlation between the base year and the current year. 
In general, emission factors (and other estimation parameters) uncertainties will tend to be correlated between 
years while activity data will tend to be uncorrelated between years. The basic approach presented assumes full 
correlation between emission factors in the base year and the current year and independence between activity data 
in the base year and the current year. The method allows for change in case the activity data for a category is fully 
correlated between years or emission factor for a category is independent between years reflecting national 
circumstances. However, as for the level approach, the method does not provide for partial correlations. 
The uncertainty in the trend in total emissions from the country is estimated as:

UTe,I 
= trend uncertainty introduced by the uncertainty associated with the emission factor of the 
category/gas i 
UTa,I 
= trend uncertainty introduced by the uncertainty associated with the activity data of the category/ 
gas i 
It is important to note that while the level uncertainty is reported as a confidence interval expressed as percentage 
uncertainties in relation to the point estimate, the uncertainty of the trend is reported as a confidence interval 
expressed in percentage points to be added to or subtracted from the trend estimation. For example, if the emissions 
for year t are 10 Gg and the result of the level uncertainty is ±2%, the confidence interval for the emissions will 
be [9.8, 10.2]. Differently, if the trend in the emissions is 10% between the base year and year t and the result of 
the trend uncertainty is ±2%, this means that the confidence interval for the trend will be [8%, 12%]. 
In order to know how the uncertainty of the emission factors and activity data affects the trend in the emissions 
Type A and Type B sensitivities need to be developed as follows: 
• Type A sensitivity: the change in the difference in overall emissions between the base year and the current year, 
expressed as a percentage, resulting from a 1 percent increase in emissions or removals of a given category and 
gas in both the base year and the current year.

Under the assumption that the emission factors are fully correlated, variation in the base year emission factor will 
correspond to the same variation in the current year emission factor. Hence, the emission factor uncertainty will 
be propagated to the trend through a Type A sensitivity.

Worksheet for Approach 1 Uncertainty Calculation 
The columns of Table 3.2, Approach 1 Uncertainty Calculation, are labelled A to Q and contain the following 
information, of which the derivation of key equations is given in Section 3.7.1 in Section 3.7, Technical 
Background Information. 
• A shows the sector of the IPCC category. 
• B shows the code of the IPCC category. 
 
Chapter 3: Uncertainties 
 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
3.25 
• C shows the name of the IPCC category. 
• D shows the greenhouse gas. 
• E and F are the inventory estimates in the base year and the current year4F5 respectively, for the category and gas 
specified in Columns C and D, expressed in CO2 equivalents. 
• G and I contain the uncertainties for the activity data and emission factors respectively, derived from a mixture 
of empirical data and expert judgement as previously described in this chapter, entered as half the 95 percent 
confidence interval divided by the mean and expressed as a percentage. The reason for halving the 95 percent 
confidence interval is that the value entered in Columns G and I corresponds to the familiar plus or minus value 
when uncertainties are loosely quoted as ‘plus or minus x percent’, so expert judgements of this type can be 
directly entered in the spreadsheet. If uncertainty is known to be highly asymmetrical, enter the larger 
percentage difference between the mean and the confidence limit. 
• H indicates if the uncertainty in activity data is correlated across years. 
• J indicates if the uncertainty in emission factor is correlated across years. 
• K is the combined uncertainty by category derived from the data in Columns G and I using the error propagation 
equation (Equation 3.2). The entry in Column K is therefore the square root of the sum of the squares of the 
entries in Columns G and I.  
• L shows the uncertainty in Column K as a percentage of total national emissions in the current year. The entry 
in each row of Column L is the square of the entry in Column K multiplied by the square of the entry in Column 
F, divided by the square of total at the foot of Column F. The value at the foot of Column L is an estimate of 
the percentage uncertainty in total national net emissions in the current year, calculated from the entries above 
using Equation 3.1. This total is obtained by summing the entries in Column L and taking the square root. 
• M shows how the percentage difference in emissions between the base year and the current year changes in 
response to a one percent increase in category emissions/removals for both the base year and the current year. 
This shows the sensitivity of the trend in emissions to a systematic uncertainty in the estimate (i.e., one that is 
correlated between the base year and the current year). This is the Type A sensitivity as defined above.  
• N shows how the percentage difference in emissions between the base year and the current year changes in 
response to a one percent increase in category emissions/removals in the current year only. This shows the 
sensitivity of the trend in emissions to random error in the estimate (i.e., one that is not correlated, between the 
base year and the current year). This is the Type B sensitivity as described above.  
• O shows the uncertainty introduced into the trend in emissions by emission factor uncertainty. If the uncertainty 
in emission factors is correlated between years (J = Y) the result is the product of the information in Columns 
M and I. If the emission factor uncertainties are not correlated between years (J = N) then the entry in Column 
N should be used in place of that in Column M and the result multiplied by √2.  
• P shows the uncertainty introduced into the trend in emissions by activity data uncertainty. If the uncertainty 
in activity data is not correlated between years (H = N) the result is the product of the information in Columns 
N and G multiplied by √2. If the activity data uncertainties are correlated between years (H = Y) then the entry 
in Column M should be used in place of that in Column N and the √2 factor does not then apply.  
• Q is an estimate of the uncertainty introduced into the trend in national emissions by the category in question. 
Under Approach 1, this is derived from the data in Columns O and P using Equation 3.2. The entry in Column 
Q is therefore the sum of the squares of the entries in Columns O and P. The total at the foot of this column is 
an estimate of the total uncertainty in the trend, calculated from the entries above using the error propagation 
equation. This total is obtained by summing the entries in Column Q and taking the square root. The uncertainty 
in the trend is a percentage point range relative to the inventory trend. For example, if the current year 
emissions are 10 percent greater than the base year emissions, and if the trend uncertainty at the foot of Column 
Q is reported as 5 percent, then the trend uncertainty is 10% ±5% (or from 5% to 15% increase) for the current 
year emissions relative to the base year emissions. 
• Explanatory footnotes go at the bottom of the table and give documentary references of uncertainty data 
(including measured data) or other relevant comments. 
 
5 The current year is the most recent year for which inventory data are available.

Note A: If only total uncertainty is known for a category (not for emission factor and activity data separately), 
then: 
• If uncertainty is correlated across years, enter the uncertainty into Column I, and enter 0 in Column G; it is 
suggested to assume correlation across years if some of the parameters used in the estimates are the same in 
both years or derived from the same source. 
• If uncertainty is not correlated across years, enter the uncertainty into Column G, and enter 0 in Column I; it is 
suggested to assume no correlation between years if the estimates for the two years are independent from each 
other, for example based on independent measurements.

The section further elaborates on the two approaches to combine uncertainties presented in Section 3.2.3 of the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines: Approach 1, simple propagation of error equations, and Approach 2, Monte Carlo 
simulation. A tool for the implementation of Approach 1 is also included as an addendum. 
Two examples of uncertainty estimates for inventories are described, one based upon Finland’s GHG inventory 
(Statistics Finland 2018), and the other one on Italy’s GHG inventory (ISPRA 2018).  
The example of Table 3.4 is based upon Approach 1, and is shown in the general format of Approach 1 worksheet

Step-by-step example for Approach 2 based on the Italian GHG Inventory (CH4 emissions from enteric 
fermentation in the Agriculture sector) is provided below (ISPRA 2018). This example focuses on the process of 
obtaining the data for all parameters involved and the analysis of results. CH4 emissions are estimated by a Tier 2 
approach (for cattle and buffalo) and Tier 1 approach for other livestock species. 
Step 1 
A list of selected parameters used in the CH4 emission factors estimation process is indicated in Table 3.6. For 
each parameter, the choices of distributions and underlying assumptions are described with identification whether 
they were modeled by Monte Carlo.

For each parameter, the choice of distribution and distribution parameters (mean, median, range etc.) is based on 
actual information if available (literature, distribution of measurements, past data information) or/and expert 
judgment. The shape of distribution may vary from the classical normal or lognormal distributions to more 
sophisticated ones. Whenever assumptions or constraints on variables are known, this information is reflected on 
the choice of type and shape of distributions (e.g. variability, asymmetry and multimodal). 
Examples of selected distributions for some parameters are shown in Figure 3.8a.

The application of Approach 1 uncertainty assessment to this category, considering an uncertainty value equal to 
±3% for activity data and a default uncertainty value of ±20% (for emission factors based on Tier 2 methodology), 
results in an overall uncertainty equal to ±20.2% at category level.  
The probability density function resulting from the Monte Carlo assessment is shown in the Figure 3.8b. 
Figure 3.8b (New) Probability density function from Monte Carlo assessment (based on ISPRA 
2018) 
 
Step 3 
The most relevant parameters for the uncertainty of CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation, measured by the 
rank correlation coefficient have been individuated from the application of Monte Carlo. These are the number of 
dairy cattle, digestibility and the weight of animals. As far as feasible, it is important to reduce the associated 
uncertainty. 
The results of this analysis are shown in the Figure 3.8c.
