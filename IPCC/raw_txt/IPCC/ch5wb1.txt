LAND-USE CHANGE &
FORESTRY
5.1 
Introduction
The priority calculations of emissions from land-use change and forestry
focus upon three activities which are sources or sinks of carbon dioxide.  It
must be pointed out that there are inherently large uncertainties or errors
associated with these calculations.  Future work will develop guidance for
estimating and expressing these errors.  One of these activity types is also a
source of non-CO2 trace gas (CH4, CO, N2O, and NOx) emissions, and
these are also calculated here.  NMVOCs are not treated here, although it
is recognised that forests are a potential anthropogenic source of these
gases.
On a global scale the most important land-use changes and management
practices that result in CO2 emissions and uptake are:
•
changes in forest and other woody biomass stocks
•
forest and grassland conversion
•
abandonment of managed lands
The immediate release of non-CO2 trace gases from the burning associated
with forest/grassland conversion is also calculated.  These calculations are
very similar to calculations of non-CO2 trace gas emissions from burning of
savannas and agricultural residues (in the Agriculture module, Chapter 4).
Calculations of non-CO2emissions from biomass fuel combustion is done in
the Energy Module.  The present module deals with the sources and sinks
of greenhouse gases from biomass and soil.

The diagram above illustrates the relationships between the categories in
this module and also with biomass fuel combustion in the Energy module.
The key linkages are:
1
To estimate CO2 emissions from burning during forest/grassland
conversion it is only necessary to know the total amount of biomass
burned as a result of that land conversion in the particular year of the
inventory.
2
Total biomass burned must be divided into on-site and off-site (i.e.,
fuelwood) because the type of burning affects the emissions of non-
CO2 trace gases such as methane, and therefore different emissions
factors may be applied to open burning (on-site) and to fuelwood use
(off-site).

Countries which have good statistics on direct harvesting of all types of
woody biomass and all uses of biomass for fuel should use these data. In
many countries, significant amounts of wood removed from forests and
other biomass stocks (primarily for domestic use) are not included in
commercial harvest statistics. These countries can use statistics of
fuelwood consumption published by the FAO.  These statistics are
based on household and other fuel consumption surveys, scaled to
population, in order to estimate annual demand for fuelwood and other
traditional fuels. This information can be used instead of or in
combination with commercial harvest and sales statistics.
Fuelwood consumption information is used in two ways:
•
for estimating non-CO2 trace gas emissions from biomass fuel
combustion.
•
total wood consumption, corrected to deduct any wood which has
come from forest and grassland conversion (CO2 already
accounted for) is also a key input for calculating net CO2 emissions
or removals due to changes in forest and other woody biomass
stocks.

To calculate the net uptake of CO2, the annual increment of biomass in
plantations, forests which are logged or otherwise harvested, the growth of
trees in villages, farms and urban areas and any other significant stocks of
woody biomass, is estimated.
Wood harvested for fuelwood, commercial timber and other uses is also
estimated as significant quantities may be gathered informally for traditional
fuelwood consumption.  In this case the commercial statistics should be
supplemented by FAO fuelwood consumption data.
The net carbon uptake due to these sources is then calculated. If the figure
is positive then this counts as a removal of CO2, and if the figure is negative,
it counts as an emission. Finally, the net carbon uptake/emission is
expressed as CO2.

For each type of biomass stock, enter the Area of Forest/Biomass
Stocks in kilohectares (kha) in lower column A.
2 
For dispersed (non-forest) trees (e.g., urban, village and farm trees),
enter the number of trees (in 1000s of trees) in lower column A.
3 
For each type of forest, enter the Annual Growth Rate (in tonnes of
dry matter per hectare) in column B.
The default statistics in Tables 5-1 or 5-6 can be used if national data are
not available.  Using defaults would result in highly uncertain national
estimates.
CATEGORIES OF WOODY BIOMASS
Village, farm or urban trees and other
afforestation 
programmes 
are
included to allow users to account
for biomass in trees outside normal
forests. These may be important for
fuelwood 
accounting 
in 
some
countries. Users must provide all
data for these categories.

USING COMMERCIAL HARVEST
STATISTICS
Commercial harvest statistics are often
provided for the commercial portion of the
biomass only, in cubic metres (m3) of
roundwood. In this case the harvested
amounts must be adjusted in two ways to
reflect 
the 
values 
needed 
for 
the
emissions/removals calculations. The volume
of biomass expressed as m3 must be
converted to mass of dry matter expressed
as tonnes (t dm).
•
The default conversion ratio is
0.5 t dm/m3.
In addition, an expansion ratio can be
applied to account for the non-commercial
biomass (limbs, small trees etc.) harvested
with the commercial roundwood and left to
decay. The following default ratios can be
used:
•
Undisturbed forests  1.75
Logged forests  1.90
Unproductive forests  2.00
If the forest type from which commercial
roundwood has been harvested is known,
the appropriate ratio can be applied. The
value for logged forests could be used as a
general default. More detailed formulae for
deriving expansion ratio as a function of pre-
harvest biomass density are discussed in the
Reference Manual.
If both conversion and expansion are
needed, they can be combined by using
ratios which are the product of the two:
Forest type
t dm total biomass/ m3
commercial roundwood
Undisturbed
forests
0.88
Logged forests
0.95
Unproductive
forests
1.0
Some harvest statistics are provided on a
total biomass basis (expansion ratios already
applied) or may be provided in mass of dry
matter rather than volume. It is important
that users determine carefully the nature of
the values in their sources of commercial
harvest data, then apply the appropriate
conversions or expansions to get total
biomass harvested. This can be:
a volume to mass conversion alone
b expansion from commercial to total mass
of dry matter
c a combination of both (a and b)

CO 2 Emissions from Forest and
Grassland Conversion
5 . 3 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
Forest and grassland conversion to permanent cropland or pasture is primarily
an activity of the tropics.  Tropical forest clearing is usually accomplished by
cutting undergrowth and felling trees followed by burning biomass on-site or as
fuelwood.  By this process some of the biomass is burned while some remains
on the ground where it decays slowly (usually over a period of ten years in the
tropics).  Of the burned material, a small fraction (5-10 per cent) is converted to
charcoal which resists decay for 100 years or more, and the remainder is
released instantaneously into the atmosphere as CO2.
Where conversion of forest and grassland to permanent cropland and
pasture occurs outside the tropics, the basic calculations should still be the
same.
Carbon is also lost from the soils after conversion, particularly when the
land is cultivated.  Conversion of grasslands into cultivated lands also results
in CO2 emissions, mainly from soils.  Estimates of carbon emissions from
these practices in Section 5.6.
5 . 3 . 2  D a t a  S o u r c e s
To carry out the inventory task in this section you need the following
forest/grassland area statistics.
Forest/grassland areas converted to cropland and pasture, by type over two
time periods:
•

• 
the past ten years
Satellite images, aerial photography and land-based surveys are all possible

5 . 3 . 3  M e t h o d o l o g y
Three sets of calculations are used to produce estimates of CO2 emissions
due to forest/grassland conversion:
•
Carbon dioxide emitted by burning aboveground biomass
(immediate emissions, occurring in the year of conversion)
•
Carbon dioxide released by decay of aboveground biomass (delayed
emissions, occurring over a ten-year period)
•
Carbon dioxide released from soil (calculated in Section 5.6).
The totals are added together to arrive at total for carbon released from
vegetation.  Total carbon released is then converted to CO2 emissions.

FRACTIONS
Various

are 
used 
in
calculating 
the 
emissions 
from
forest/grassland conversion.
• 
Fraction biomass burned on-site
and off-site.
• 
Fraction left to decay.  This is the
portion of the biomass which is
simply left to decay and so
releases gases at a slower rate.
• 
Fraction which oxidises during
burning.  This is the fraction of
burned biomass which actually
oxidises instead of turning to
charcoal.

On-site Burning of Forests:
Emissions of Non-CO 2 Trace Gases
5 . 4 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
All burning of biomass (e.g., fuelwood, dung) for energy and of savannas and
agricultural wastes is a significant source of CH4, N2O, CO and NOx.  Net
CO2 emissions from forest/grassland conversion were calculated in
Section 5.3 above.  Emissions of non-CO2 trace gases from on-site burning
of forests are calculated here.
5 . 4 . 2  M e t h o d o l o g y
The method relies on estimation of the gross carbon flux based on work
done in Section 5.3 of this Workbook.
CH4 and CO are estimated as ratios to carbon fluxes emitted during
burning.  Total nitrogen content is estimated based on the nitrogen-carbon
ratio.  N2O and NOx are estimated as ratios to total nitrogen.
ESTIMATING FRACTION LEFT TO
DECAY
In the Amazon, Fraction Left to Decay
is typically about 0.5 but this varies
greatly by region.  Country experts
must provide this value.
There is a relationship between the
fraction left to decay here and the
fraction burned on and off site.  For a
given year the fraction burned, the
fraction left to decay (and possibly a
fraction harvested as 
commercial
timber or other non-fuel use) should
sum to 1.0, accounting for all biomass
cleared.  Because the burning and
decay portions are averaged over
different 
time 
periods 
in 
the
methodology, the relationship need
not be precise.  However, assumptions
made for these different fractions
should be consistent.
Furthermore, in countries 
where
fuelwood is critically short no wood
may be left on site to burn or decay.

Abandonment of Managed Lands
5 . 5 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
This submodule deals with net-CO2 removals in biomass accumulation
resulting from the abandonment of managed lands.  Managed lands include:
•
Cultivated lands (arable land used for the cultivation of crops)
•
Pasture (land used for grazing animals)
Carbon accumulation on abandoned lands is sensitive to the type of natural
ecosystem (forest type or grasslands) which is regrowing.  Therefore
abandoned lands regrowing should be entered by type.  For grasslands the
default assumption is that net accumulation aboveground is zero.
Because regrowth rates become slower after a time, the periods considered
are:
•
Land abandoned during the 20 years prior to the Inventory Year (i.e.,
1990)
•
Land abandoned between 20 and 100 years ago (i.e., before 1970 and
after 1870)
When managed lands are abandoned, carbon may or may not reaccumulate
on the land.  Abandoned areas are therefore split into those which
reaccumulate carbon and those which do not regrowth or which continue
to degrade.
Only natural lands which are regrowing towards a natural state should be
included.  Lands which do not regrow or degrade should be ignored in this
calculation.
As with forest and grassland conversion, effect of forest regrowth on soil
carbon is dealt with in Section 5.6 of the Workbook.
                                                  
     1 The molecular weight ratios given above for the emitted gases are with
respect to the weight of nitrogen and carbon in the molecule.  Thus for
N2O the ratio is 44/28 and for NOx it is 46/14.  NO2 has been used as the
reference molecule for NOx.

Two sets of calculations are used to estimate CO2 removals from biomass
regrowth and soils recovery.  They relate to the quantity of land abandoned
and the length of time for which it has been abandoned:
• 
Annual carbon uptake in aboveground biomass (land abandoned in the
last twenty years)
• 
Annual carbon uptake in aboveground biomass (land abandoned for
between twenty and a hundred years, if applicable).
These are then totalled and the carbon uptake is converted into CO2
removals.
