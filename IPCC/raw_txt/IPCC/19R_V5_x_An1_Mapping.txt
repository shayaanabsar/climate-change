CHAPTER 6 WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND DISCHARGE 
This chapter presents an update of the Wastewater Treatment and Discharge chapter of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines. The refinements laid out in this chapter provide clarity over how to apply the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
and definitions of treatment systems presented and introduce new and improved default values and emission 
factors based on further scientific research into the mechanisms associated with GHG emissions from 
wastewater treatment (including sludge treatment that occurs within the WWTP). In addition, these refinements 
present an updated section on N2O emissions to better address emissions from domestic wastewater, including 
centralised treatment plants, and to include emissions from industrial wastewater.   
Sections 
• 
New subsections have been added to the Introduction to provide a discussion of technical topics related to 
new guidance presented in the chapter. 
• 
Sections that discuss CH4 emissions from domestic and industrial wastewater, as well as N2O emissions 
from domestic wastewater have been updated to reflect the refinements presented throughout the chapter. 
• 
A new section, Section 6.4, has been added to provide new guidance on estimating N2O emissions from 
industrial wastewater. 
• 
A series of annexes have been included to provide additional details related to new or revised emission 
factors and default activity data. 
• 
An appendix has been added to provide a discussion of non-biogemic CO2 emissions from wastewater 
treatment and discharge.

Tables 
• 
Table 6.1 was updated to reflect refinements to the overall wastewater treatment systems and discharge 
pathways covered in this chapter. 
• 
Tables 6.3, 6.7, 6.8, and 6.11 have been updated, and Tables 6.8a (New) and 6.13 (New) introduced, to 
reflect updated or new emissions factors for CH4 and N2O emissions and the resulting uncertainty ranges. 
An alternate set of emission factors is provided for CH4 and N2O emissions from wastewater after disposal 
of untreated wastewater or wastewater treatment effluent into aquatic environments when the country has 
activity data to differentiate the conditions of the waterbody receiving the discharge. 
• 
Tables 6.6a (New) and 6.6b (New) have been introduced to provide default values for the removal of 
organic component from wastewater as sludge (KREM) and wastewater treatment organics removal fractions 
(TOWREM), according to treatment type. 
• 
Table 6.10a (New) provides regional default factors for sources of nitrogen in domestic wastewater.

• 
Table 6.10b (New) has been added to provide additional country-specific information on the use of food 
waste disposals if needing to calculate a country-specific value for the fraction of protein not consumed. 
• 
Table 6.10c (New) has been introduced to provide default values for the removal of nitrogen from 
wastewater (NREM). 
• 
Table 6.12 (New) has been added to provide default values for use in estimating N2O emissions from 
industrial wastewater.
