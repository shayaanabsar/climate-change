Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
Executive Summary
Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would 
require transformative systemic change, integrated with 
sustainable development. Such change would require the 
upscaling and acceleration of the implementation of far-
reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation 
and addressing barriers. Such systemic change would need 
to be linked to complementary adaptation actions, including 
transformational adaptation, especially for pathways that 
temporarily overshoot 1.5°C (medium evidence, high agreement) 
{Chapter 2, Chapter 3, 4.2.1, 4.4.5, 4.5}. Current national pledges 
on mitigation and adaptation are not enough to stay below the Paris 
Agreement temperature limits and achieve its adaptation goals. While 
transitions in energy efficiency, carbon intensity of fuels, electrification 
and land-use change are underway in various countries, limiting 
warming to 1.5°C will require a greater scale and pace of change to 
transform energy, land, urban and industrial systems globally. {4.3, 4.4, 
Cross-Chapter Box 9 in this Chapter} 
Although multiple communities around the world are 
demonstrating the possibility of implementation consistent with 
1.5°C pathways {Boxes 4.1-4.10}, very few countries, regions, 
cities, communities or businesses can currently make such 
a claim (high confidence). To strengthen the global response, 
almost all countries would need to significantly raise their level 
of ambition. Implementation of this raised ambition would 
require enhanced institutional capabilities in all countries, 
including building the capability to utilize indigenous and local 
knowledge (medium evidence, high agreement). In developing 
countries and for poor and vulnerable people, implementing the 
response would require financial, technological and other forms of 
support to build capacity, for which additional local, national and 
international resources would need to be mobilized (high confidence). 
However, public, financial, institutional and innovation capabilities 
currently fall short of implementing far-reaching measures at scale in 
all countries (high confidence). Transnational networks that support 
multilevel climate action are growing, but challenges in their scale-up 
remain. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7}
Adaptation needs will be lower in a 1.5°C world compared to 
a 2°C world (high confidence) {Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Box 11 
in this chapter}. Learning from current adaptation practices and 
strengthening them through adaptive governance {4.4.1}, lifestyle 
and behavioural change {4.4.3} and innovative financing mechanisms 
{4.4.5} can help their mainstreaming within sustainable development 
practices. Preventing maladaptation, drawing on bottom-up approaches 
{Box 4.6} and using indigenous knowledge {Box 4.3} would effectively 
engage and protect vulnerable people and communities. While 
adaptation finance has increased quantitatively, significant further 
expansion would be needed to adapt to 1.5°C. Qualitative gaps in the 
distribution of adaptation finance, readiness to absorb resources, and 
monitoring mechanisms undermine the potential of adaptation finance 
to reduce impacts. {Chapter 3, 4.4.2, 4.4.5, 4.6}
System Transitions
The energy system transition that would be required to limit 
global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial conditions is 
underway in many sectors and regions around the world 
(medium evidence, high agreement). The political, economic, social 
and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity 
storage technologies has improved dramatically over the past few 
years, while that of nuclear energy and carbon dioxide capture 
and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector have not shown similar 
improvements. {4.3.1}
Electrification, hydrogen, bio-based feedstocks and substitution, 
and, in several cases, carbon dioxide capture, utilization and 
storage (CCUS) would lead to the deep emissions reductions 
required in energy-intensive industries to limit warming to 
1.5°C. However, those options are limited by institutional, economic and 
technical constraints, which increase financial risks to many incumbent 
firms (medium evidence, high agreement). Energy efficiency in industry 
is more economically feasible and helps enable industrial system 
transitions but would have to be complemented with greenhouse gas 
(GHG)-neutral processes or carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to make 
energy-intensive industries consistent with 1.5°C (high confidence). 
{4.3.1, 4.3.4}
Global and regional land-use and ecosystems transitions and 
associated changes in behaviour that would be required to 
limit warming to 1.5°C can enhance future adaptation and 
land-based agricultural and forestry mitigation potential. Such 
transitions could, however, carry consequences for livelihoods 
that depend on agriculture and natural resources {4.3.2, Cross-
Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3}. Alterations of agriculture and forest 
systems to achieve mitigation goals could affect current ecosystems 
and their services and potentially threaten food, water and livelihood 
security. While this could limit the social and environmental feasibility 
of land-based mitigation options, careful design and implementation 
could enhance their acceptability and support sustainable development 
objectives (medium evidence, medium agreement). {4.3.2, 4.5.3}
Changing agricultural practices can be an effective climate 
adaptation strategy. A diversity of adaptation options exists, 
including mixed crop-livestock production systems which can be a 
cost-effective adaptation strategy in many global agriculture systems 
(robust evidence, medium agreement). Improving irrigation efficiency 
could effectively deal with changing global water endowments, 
especially if achieved via farmers adopting new behaviours and water-
efficient practices rather than through large-scale infrastructural 
interventions (medium evidence, medium agreement). Well-designed 
adaptation processes such as community-based adaptation can be 
effective depending upon context and levels of vulnerability. {4.3.2, 
4.5.3}
Improving the efficiency of food production and closing yield 
gaps have the potential to reduce emissions from agriculture, 
reduce pressure on land, and enhance food security and future 
316
Chapter 4 
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response

mitigation potential (high confidence). Improving productivity of 
existing agricultural systems generally reduces the emissions intensity 
of food production and offers strong synergies with rural development, 
poverty reduction and food security objectives, but options to reduce 
absolute emissions are limited unless paired with demand-side 
measures. Technological innovation including biotechnology, with 
adequate safeguards, could contribute to resolving current feasibility 
constraints and expand the future mitigation potential of agriculture. 
{4.3.2, 4.4.4}
Shifts in dietary choices towards foods with lower emissions 
and requirements for land, along with reduced food loss and 
waste, could reduce emissions and increase adaptation options 
(high confidence). Decreasing food loss and waste and changing 
dietary behaviour could result in mitigation and adaptation (high 
confidence) by reducing both emissions and pressure on land, with 
significant co-benefits for food security, human health and sustainable 
development {4.3.2, 4.4.5, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 5.4.2}, but evidence of 
successful policies to modify dietary choices remains limited. 
Mitigation and Adaptation Options and Other Measures
A mix of mitigation and adaptation options implemented in a 
participatory and integrated manner can enable rapid, systemic 
transitions – in urban and rural areas – that are necessary 
elements of an accelerated transition consistent with limiting 
warming to 1.5°C. Such options and changes are most effective 
when aligned with economic and sustainable development, 
and when local and regional governments are supported by 
national governments {4.3.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.3}. Various mitigation 
options are expanding rapidly across many geographies. Although 
many have development synergies, not all income groups have so 
far benefited from them. Electrification, end-use energy efficiency 
and increased share of renewables, amongst other options, are 
lowering energy use and decarbonizing energy supply in the built 
environment, especially in buildings. Other rapid changes needed in 
urban environments include demotorization and decarbonization of 
transport, including the expansion of electric vehicles, and greater use 
of energy-efficient appliances (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Technological and social innovations can contribute to limiting 
warming to 1.5°C, for example, by enabling the use of smart grids, 
energy storage technologies and general-purpose technologies, such 
as information and communication technology (ICT) that can be 
deployed to help reduce emissions. Feasible adaptation options include 
green infrastructure, resilient water and urban ecosystem services, 
urban and peri-urban agriculture, and adapting buildings and land use 
through regulation and planning (medium evidence, medium to high 
agreement). {4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}
Synergies can be achieved across systemic transitions through 
several overarching adaptation options in rural and urban areas. 
Investments in health, social security and risk sharing and spreading 
are cost-effective adaptation measures with high potential for scaling 
up (medium evidence, medium to high agreement). Disaster risk 
management and education-based adaptation have lower prospects of 
scalability and cost-effectiveness (medium evidence, high agreement) 
but are critical for building adaptive capacity. {4.3.5, 4.5.3}
Converging adaptation and mitigation options can lead to 
synergies and potentially increase cost-effectiveness, but 
multiple trade-offs can limit the speed of and potential for 
scaling up. Many examples of synergies and trade-offs exist in 
all sectors and system transitions. For instance, sustainable water 
management (high evidence, medium agreement) and investment in 
green infrastructure (medium evidence, high agreement) to deliver 
sustainable water and environmental services and to support urban 
agriculture are less cost-effective than other adaptation options but 
can help build climate resilience. Achieving the governance, finance 
and social support required to enable these synergies and to avoid 
trade-offs is often challenging, especially when addressing multiple 
objectives, and attempting appropriate sequencing and timing of 
interventions. {4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4}
Though CO2 dominates long-term warming, the reduction of 
warming short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), such as methane 
and black carbon, can in the short term contribute significantly to 
limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Reductions 
of black carbon and methane would have substantial co-benefits 
(high confidence), including improved health due to reduced air 
pollution. This, in turn, enhances the institutional and socio-
cultural feasibility of such actions. Reductions of several warming 
SLCFs are constrained by economic and social feasibility (low evidence, 
high agreement). As they are often co-emitted with CO2, achieving the 
energy, land and urban transitions necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C 
would see emissions of warming SLCFs greatly reduced. {2.3.3.2, 4.3.6} 
Most CDR options face multiple feasibility constraints, which 
differ between options, limiting the potential for any single 
option to sustainably achieve the large-scale deployment 
required in the 1.5°C-consistent pathways described in 
Chapter 2 (high confidence). Those 1.5°C pathways typically rely 
on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation 
and reforestation (AR), or both, to neutralize emissions that are 
expensive to avoid, or to draw down CO2 emissions in excess of the 
carbon budget {Chapter 2}. Though BECCS and AR may be technically 
and geophysically feasible, they face partially overlapping yet different 
constraints related to land use. The land footprint per tonne of CO2 
removed is higher for AR than for BECCS, but given the low levels of 
current deployment, the speed and scales required for limiting warming 
to 1.5°C pose a considerable implementation challenge, even if the 
issues of public acceptance and absence of economic incentives were 
to be resolved (high agreement, medium evidence). The large potential 
of afforestation and the co-benefits if implemented appropriately (e.g., 
on biodiversity and soil quality) will diminish over time, as forests 
saturate (high confidence). The energy requirements and economic 
costs of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) and enhanced 
weathering remain high (medium evidence, medium agreement). At the 
local scale, soil carbon sequestration has co-benefits with agriculture 
and is cost-effective even without climate policy (high confidence). Its 
potential feasibility and cost-effectiveness at the global scale appears 
to be more limited. {4.3.7}
Uncertainties 
surrounding 
solar 
radiation 
modification 
(SRM) measures constrain their potential deployment. These 
uncertainties include: technological immaturity; limited physical 
317
4
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
understanding about their effectiveness to limit global warming; and 
a weak capacity to govern, legitimize, and scale such measures. Some 
recent model-based analysis suggests SRM would be effective but that 
it is too early to evaluate its feasibility. Even in the uncertain case that 
the most adverse side-effects of SRM can be avoided, public resistance, 
ethical concerns and potential impacts on sustainable development 
could render SRM economically, socially and institutionally undesirable 
(low agreement, medium evidence). {4.3.8, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in 
this chapter}
Enabling Rapid and Far-Reaching Change 
The speed of transitions and of technological change required 
to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels has been 
observed in the past within specific sectors and technologies 
{4.2.2.1}. But the geographical and economic scales at which 
the required rates of change in the energy, land, urban, 
infrastructure and industrial systems would need to take place 
are larger and have no documented historic precedent (limited 
evidence, medium agreement). To reduce inequality and alleviate 
poverty, such transformations would require more planning and 
stronger institutions (including inclusive markets) than observed in the 
past, as well as stronger coordination and disruptive innovation across 
actors and scales of governance. {4.3, 4.4}
Governance consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and the 
political economy of adaptation and mitigation can enable and 
accelerate systems transitions, behavioural change, innovation and 
technology deployment (medium evidence, medium agreement). 
For 1.5°C-consistent actions, an effective governance framework 
would include: accountable multilevel governance that includes non-
state actors, such as industry, civil society and scientific institutions; 
coordinated sectoral and cross-sectoral policies that enable collaborative 
multi-stakeholder partnerships; strengthened global-to-local financial 
architecture that enables greater access to finance and technology; 
addressing climate-related trade barriers; improved climate education 
and greater public awareness; arrangements to enable accelerated 
behaviour change; strengthened climate monitoring and evaluation 
systems; and reciprocal international agreements that are sensitive 
to equity and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). System 
transitions can be enabled by enhancing the capacities of public, private 
and financial institutions to accelerate climate change policy planning 
and implementation, along with accelerated technological innovation, 
deployment and upkeep. {4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4}
Behaviour change and demand-side management can 
significantly reduce emissions, substantially limiting the 
reliance on CDR to limit warming to 1.5°C {Chapter 2, 4.4.3}.
Political and financial stakeholders may find climate actions more cost-
effective and socially acceptable if multiple factors affecting behaviour 
are considered, including aligning these actions with people’s core 
values (medium evidence, high agreement). Behaviour- and lifestyle-
related measures and demand-side management have already led 
to emission reductions around the world and can enable significant 
future reductions (high confidence). Social innovation through bottom-
up initiatives can result in greater participation in the governance of 
systems transitions and increase support for technologies, practices 
and policies that are part of the global response to limit warming to 
1.5°C . {Chapter 2, 4.4.1, 4.4.3, Figure 4.3} 
This rapid and far-reaching response required to keep warming 
below 1.5°C and enhance the capacity to adapt to climate risks 
would require large increases of investments in low-emission 
infrastructure and buildings, along with a redirection of financial 
flows towards low-emission investments (robust evidence, high 
agreement). An estimated mean annual incremental investment of 
around 1.5% of global gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) for the 
energy sector is indicated between 2016 and 2035, as well as about 
2.5% of global GFCF for other development infrastructure that could 
also address SDG implementation. Though quality policy design and 
effective implementation may enhance efficiency, they cannot fully 
substitute for these investments. {2.5.2, 4.2.1, 4.4.5}
Enabling this investment requires the mobilization and better 
integration of a range of policy instruments that include the 
reduction of socially inefficient fossil fuel subsidy regimes and innovative 
price and non-price national and international policy instruments. These 
would need to be complemented by de-risking financial instruments 
and the emergence of long-term low-emission assets. These instruments 
would aim to reduce the demand for carbon-intensive services and shift 
market preferences away from fossil fuel-based technology. Evidence 
and theory suggest that carbon pricing alone, in the absence of 
sufficient transfers to compensate their unintended distributional cross-
sector, cross-nation effects, cannot reach the incentive levels needed 
to trigger system transitions (robust evidence, medium agreement). 
But, embedded in consistent policy packages, they can help mobilize 
incremental resources and provide flexible mechanisms that help reduce 
the social and economic costs of the triggering phase of the transition 
(robust evidence, medium agreement). {4.4.3, 4.4.4, 4.4.5}
Increasing 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
a 
climate-sensitive 
realignment of savings and expenditure towards low-emission, 
climate-resilient infrastructure and services requires an 
evolution of global and national financial systems. Estimates 
suggest that, in addition to climate-friendly allocation of public 
investments, a potential redirection of 5% to 10% of the annual 
capital revenues1 is necessary for limiting warming to 1.5°C {4.4.5, 
Table 1 in Box 4.8}. This could be facilitated by a change of incentives 
for private day-to-day expenditure and the redirection of savings 
from speculative and precautionary investments towards long-
term productive low-emission assets and services. This implies the 
mobilization of institutional investors and mainstreaming of climate 
finance within financial and banking system regulation. Access by 
developing countries to low-risk and low-interest finance through 
multilateral and national development banks would have to be 
facilitated (medium evidence, high agreement). New forms of public–
private partnerships may be needed with multilateral, sovereign and 
sub-sovereign guarantees to de-risk climate-friendly investments, 
support new business models for small-scale enterprises and help 
households with limited access to capital. Ultimately, the aim is to

promote a portfolio shift towards long-term low-emission assets that 
would help redirect capital away from potentially stranded assets 
(medium evidence, medium agreement). {4.4.5}
Knowledge Gaps
Knowledge gaps around implementing and strengthening the 
global response to climate change would need to be urgently 
resolved if the transition to a 1.5°C world is to become reality.  
Remaining questions include: how much can be realistically expected 
from innovation and behavioural and systemic political and economic 
changes in improving resilience, enhancing adaptation and reducing 
GHG emissions? How can rates of changes be accelerated and scaled 
up? What is the outcome of realistic assessments of mitigation and 
adaptation land transitions that are compliant with sustainable 
development, poverty eradication and addressing inequality? What are 
life-cycle emissions and prospects of early-stage CDR options? How 
can climate and sustainable development policies converge, and how 
can they be organised within a global governance framework and 
financial system, based on principles of justice and ethics (including 
‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ 
(CBDR-RC)), reciprocity and partnership? To what extent would 
limiting warming to 1.5°C require a harmonization of macro-financial 
and fiscal policies, which could include financial regulators such as 
central banks? How can different actors and processes in climate 
governance reinforce each other, and hedge against the fragmentation 
of initiatives? {4.1, 4.3.7, 4.4.1, 4.4.5, 4.6}

Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
4.1 
Accelerating the Global Response 
to Climate Change
This chapter discusses how the global economy and socio-technical 
and socio-ecological systems can transition to 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways and adapt to warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. 
In the context of systemic transitions, the chapter assesses adaptation 
and mitigation options, including carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and 
potential solar radiation modification (SRM) remediative measures 
(Section 4.3), as well as the enabling conditions that would be required 
for implementing the rapid and far-reaching global response of limiting 
warming to 1.5°C (Section 4.4), and render the options more or less 
feasible (Section 4.5). 
The impacts of a 1.5°C-warmer world, while less than in a 2°C-warmer 
world, would require complementary adaptation and development 
action, typically at local and national scale. From a mitigation 
perspective, 1.5°C-consistent pathways require immediate action on 
a greater and global scale so as to achieve net zero emissions by mid-
century, or earlier (Chapter 2). This chapter and Chapter 5 highlight 
the potential that combined mitigation, development and poverty 
reduction offer for accelerated decarbonization. 
The global context is an increasingly interconnected world, with the 
human population growing from the current 7.6 billion to over 9 billion 
by mid-century (UN DESA, 2017). There has been a consistent growth of 
global economic output, wealth and trade with a significant reduction 
in extreme poverty. These trends could continue for the next few 
decades (Burt et al., 2014), potentially supported by new and disruptive 
information and communication, and nano- and bio-technologies. 
However, these trends co-exist with rising inequality (Piketty, 2014), 
exclusion and social stratification, and regions locked in poverty traps 
(Deaton, 2013) that could fuel social and political tensions. 
The aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis generated a challenging 
environment in which leading economists have issued repeated alerts 
about the ‘discontents of globalisation’ (Stiglitz, 2002), ‘depression 
economics’ (Krugman, 2009), an excessive reliance of export-led 
development strategies (Rajan, 2011), and risks of ‘secular stagnation’ 
due to the ‘saving glut’ that slows down the flow of global savings 
towards productive 1.5°C-consistent investments (Summers, 2016). 
Each of these affects the implementation of both 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways and sustainable development (Chapter 5). 
The range of mitigation and adaptation actions that can be deployed in 
the short run are well-known: for example, low-emission technologies, 
new infrastructure, and energy efficiency measures in buildings, 
industry and transport; transformation of fiscal structures; reallocation 
of investments and human resources towards low-emission assets; 
sustainable land and water management; ecosystem restoration; 
enhancement of adaptive capacities to climate risks and impacts; 
disaster risk management; research and development; and mobilization 
of new, traditional and indigenous knowledge. 
The convergence of short-term development co-benefits from 
mitigation and adaptation to address ‘everyday development failures’ 
(e.g., institutions, market structures and political processes) (Hallegatte 
et al., 2016; Pelling et al., 2018) could enhance the adaptive capacity 
of key systems at risk (e.g., water, energy, food, biodiversity, urban, 
regional and coastal systems) to 1.5°C climate impacts (Chapter 
3). The issue is whether aligning 1.5°C-consistent pathways with 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will secure support for 
accelerated change and a new growth cycle (Stern, 2013, 2015). It is 
difficult to imagine how a 1.5°C world would be attained unless the 
SDG on cities and sustainable urbanization is achieved in developing 
countries (Revi, 2016), or without reforms in the global financial 
intermediation system. 
Unless affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable 
CDR becomes feasible and available at scale well before 2050, 
1.5°C-consistent pathways will be difficult to realize, especially in 
overshoot scenarios. The social costs and benefits of 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways depend on the depth and timing of policy responses and 
their alignment with short term and long-term development objectives, 
through policy packages that bring together a diversity of  policy 
instruments, including public investment (Grubb et al., 2014; Winkler 
and Dubash, 2015; Campiglio, 2016). 
Whatever its potential long-term benefits, a transition to a 1.5°C 
world may suffer from a lack of broad political and public support, 
if it exacerbates existing short-term economic and social tensions, 
including unemployment, poverty, inequality, financial tensions, 
competitiveness issues and the loss of economic value of carbon-
intensive assets (Mercure et al., 2018). The challenge is therefore how 
to strengthen climate policies without inducing economic collapse or 
hardship, and to make them contribute to reducing some of the ‘fault 
lines’ of the world economy (Rajan, 2011).
This chapter reviews literature addressing the alignment of climate 
with other public policies (e.g., fiscal, trade, industrial, monetary, urban 
planning, infrastructure, and innovation) and with a greater access to 
basic needs and services, defined by the SDGs. It also reviews how 
de-risking low-emission investments and the evolution of the financial 
intermediation system can help reduce the ‘savings glut’ (Arezki et 
al., 2016) and the gap between cash balances and long-term assets 
(Aglietta et al., 2015b) to support more sustainable and inclusive 
growth. 
As the transitions associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways require 
accelerated and coordinated action, in multiple systems across all 
world regions, they are inherently exposed to risks of freeriding and 
moral hazards. A key governance challenge is how the convergence 
of voluntary domestic policies can be organized via aligned global, 
national and sub-national governance, based on reciprocity (Ostrom 
and Walker, 2005) and partnership (UN, 2016), and how different 
actors and processes in climate governance can reinforce each other 
to enable this (Gupta, 2014; Andonova et al., 2017). The emergence of 
polycentric sources of climate action and transnational and subnational 
networks that link these efforts (Abbott, 2012) offer the opportunity to 
experiment and learn from different approaches, thereby accelerating 
approaches led by national governments (Cole, 2015; Jordan et al., 
2015).

Section 4.2 of this chapter outlines existing rates of change and 
attributes of accelerated change. Section 4.3 identifies global systems, 
and their components, that offer options for this change. Section 4.4 
documents the enabling conditions that influence the feasibility of 
those options, including economic, financial and policy instruments that 
could trigger the transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Section 4.5 
assesses mitigation and adaptation options for feasibility, strategies for 
implementation and synergies and trade-offs between mitigation and 
adaptation.

Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C: Starting 
Points for Strengthening Implementation
4.2.1 
Implications for Implementation of 
1.5°C-Consistent Pathways 
The 1.5°C-consistent pathways assessed in Chapter 2 form the 
basis for the feasibility assessment in section 4.5. A wide range of 
1.5°C-consistent pathways from integrated assessment modelling 
(IAM), supplemented by other literature, are assessed in Chapter 2 
(Sections 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5). The most common feature shared 
by these pathways is their requirement for faster and more radical 
changes compared to 2°C and higher warming pathways.
A variety of 1.5°C-consistent technological options and policy targets 
is identified in the assessed modelling literature (Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.5). 
These technology and policy options include energy demand reduction, 
greater penetration of low-emission and carbon-free technologies 
as well as electrification of transport and industry, and reduction of 
land-use change. Both the detailed integrated modelling pathway 
literature and a number of broader sectoral and bottom-up studies 
provide examples of how these sectoral technological and policy 
characteristics can be broken down sectorally for 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways (see Table 4.1).
Both the integrated pathway literature and the sectoral studies agree 
on the need for rapid transitions in the production and use of energy 
across various sectors, to be consistent with limiting global warming 
to 1.5°C. The pace of these transitions is particularly significant for 
the supply mix and electrification (Table 4.1). Individual, sectoral 
studies may show higher rates of change compared to IAMs (Figueres 
et al., 2017; Rockström et al., 2017; WBCSD, 2017; Kuramochi et al., 
2018). These trends and transformation patterns create opportunities 
and challenges for both mitigation and adaptation (Sections 4.2.1.1 
and 4.2.1.2) and have significant implications for the assessment of 
feasibility and enablers, including governance, institutions, and policy 
instruments addressed in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

Chapter 4
4.2.1.1 Challenges and Opportunities for Mitigation Along 
the Reviewed Pathways
Greater scale, speed and change in investment patterns. There 
is agreement in the literature reviewed by Chapter 2 that staying 
below 1.5°C would entail significantly greater transformation in terms 
of energy systems, lifestyles and investments patterns compared 
to 2°C-consistent pathways. Yet there is limited evidence and low 
agreement regarding the magnitudes and costs of the investments 
(Sections 2.5.1, 2.5.2 and 4.4.5). Based on the IAM literature reviewed 
in Chapter 2, climate policies in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C 
would require a marked upscaling of supply-side energy system 
investments between now and mid-century, reaching levels of between 
1.6–3.8 trillion USD yr−1 globally with an average of about 3.5 trillion 
USD yr−1 over 2016–2050 (see Figure 2.27). This can be compared to 
an average of about 3.0 trillion USD yr−1 over the same period for 
2°C-consistent pathways (also in Figure 2.27). 
Not only the level of investment but also the type and speed of 
sectoral transformation would be impacted by the transitions 
associated with 1.5°C-consistent pathways. IAM literature projects 
that investments in low-emission energy would overtake fossil 
fuel investments globally by 2025 in 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
(Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). The projected low-emission investments 
in electricity generation allocations over the period 2016–2050 are: 
solar (0.09–1.0 trillion USD yr−1), wind (0.1–0.35 trillion USD yr−1), 
nuclear (0.1–0.25 trillion USD yr−1), and transmission, distribution, 
and storage (0.3–1.3 trillion USD yr−1). In contrast, investments in 
fossil fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity generation along 
a 1.5°C-consistent pathway are projected to drop by 0.3–0.85 trillion 
USD yr−1 over the period 2016–2050, with investments in unabated 
coal generation projected to halt by 2030 in most 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2). Estimates of investments in 
other infrastructure are currently unavailable, but they could be 
considerably larger in volume than solely those in the energy sector 
(Section 4.4.5). 
Greater policy design and decision-making implications. The 
1.5°C-consistent pathways raise multiple challenges for effective 
policy design and responses to address the scale, speed, and pace 
of mitigation technology, finance and capacity building needs. These 
policies and responses would also need to deal with their distributional 
implications while addressing adaptation to residual climate impacts 
(see Chapter 5). The available literature indicates that 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways would require robust, stringent and urgent transformative 
policy interventions targeting the decarbonization of energy supply, 
electrification, fuel switching, energy efficiency, land-use change, and 
lifestyles (Chapter 2, Section 2.5, 4.4.2, 4.4.3). Examples of effective 
approaches to integrate mitigation with adaptation in the context of 
sustainable development and to deal with distributional implications 
proposed in the literature include the utilization of dynamic adaptive 
policy pathways (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Mathy et al., 2016) and 
transdisciplinary knowledge systems (Bendito and Barrios, 2016). 
Yet, even with good policy design and effective implementation, 
1.5°C-consistent pathways would incur higher costs. Projections of the 
magnitudes of global economic costs associated with 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways and their sectoral and regional distributions from the 
currently assessed literature are scant, yet suggestive. For example, IAM 
simulations assessed in Chapter 2 project (with a probability greater 
than 50%) that marginal abatement costs, typically represented in 
IAMs through a carbon price, would increase by about 3–4 times by 
2050 under a 1.5°C-consistent pathway compared to a 2°C-consistent 
pathway (Chapter 2, Section 2.5.2, Figure 2.26). Managing these 
costs and distributional effects would require an approach that takes 
account of unintended cross-sector, cross-nation, and cross-policy 
trade-offs during the transition (Droste et al., 2016; Stiglitz et al., 2017; 
Pollitt, 2018; Sands, 2018; Siegmeier et al., 2018). 
Greater sustainable development implications. Few studies 
address the relations between the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways 
(SSPs) and the Sustainable Developments Goals (SDGs) (O’Neill et al., 
2015; Riahi et al., 2017). Nonetheless, literature on potential synergies 
and trade-offs between 1.5°C-consistent mitigation pathways and 
sustainable development dimensions is emerging (Chapter 2, Section 
2.5.3, Chapter 5, Section 5.4). Areas of potential trade-offs include 
reduction in final energy demand in relation to SDG 7 (the universal 
clean energy access goal) and increase of biomass production in 
relation to land use, water resources, food production, biodiversity 
and air quality (Chapter 2, Sections 2.4.3, 2.5.3). Strengthening the 
institutional and policy responses to deal with these challenges is 
discussed in Section 4.4 together with the linkage between disruptive 
changes in the energy sector and structural changes in other 
infrastructure (transport, building, water and telecommunication) 
sectors. A more in-depth assessment of the complexity and interfaces 
between 1.5°C-consistent pathways and sustainable development is 
presented in Chapter 5.
4.2.1.2 Implications for Adaptation Along the Reviewed 
Pathways
Climate variability and uncertainties in the underlying assumptions 
in Chapter 2’s IAMs as well as in model comparisons complicate 
discerning the implications for climate impacts, adaptation options and 
avoided adaptation investments at the global level of 2°C compared to 
1.5°C warming (James et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2017). 
Incremental warming from 1.5°C to 2°C would lead to significant 
increases in temperature and precipitation extremes in many regions 
(Chapter 3, Section 3.3.2, 3.3.3). Those projected changes in climate 
extremes under both warming levels, however, depend on the 
emissions pathways, as they have different greenhouse gas (GHG)/
aerosol forcing ratios. Impacts are sector-, system- and region-specific, 
as described in Chapter 3. For example, precipitation-related impacts 
reveal distinct regional differences (Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.3, 3.3.4, 
3.3.5, 3.4.2). Similarly, regional reduction in water availability and 
the lengthening of regional dry spells have negative implications for 
agricultural yields depending on crop types and world regions (see for 
example Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.6). 
Adaptation helps reduce impacts and risks. However, adaptation has 
limits. Not all systems can adapt, and not all impacts can be reversed 
(Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5). For example, tropical coral reefs 
are projected to be at risk of severe degradation due to temperature-
induced bleaching (Chapter 3, Box 3.4).

4.2.2 
System Transitions and Rates of Change
Society-wide transformation involves socio-technical transitions 
and social-ecological resilience (Gillard et al., 2016). Transitional 
adaptation pathways would need to respond to low-emission 
energy and economic systems, and the socio-technical transitions 
for mitigation involve removing barriers in social and institutional 
processes that could also benefit adaptation (Pant et al., 2015; Geels 
et al., 2017; Ickowitz et al., 2017). In this chapter, transformative 
change is framed in mitigation around socio-technical transitions, and 
in adaptation around socio-ecological transitions. In both instances, 
emphasis is placed on the enabling role of institutions (including 
markets, and formal and informal regulation). 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways and adaptation needs associated with warming of 1.5°C 
imply both incremental and rapid, disruptive and transformative 
changes. 
4.2.2.1 Mitigation: historical rates of change and state 
of decoupling
Realizing 1.5°C-consistent pathways would require rapid and 
systemic changes on unprecedented scales (see Chapter 2 and 
Section 4.2.1). This section examines whether the needed rates of 
change have historical precedents and are underway.
Some studies conduct a de-facto validation of IAM projections. For CO2 
emission intensity over 1990–2010, this resulted in the IAMs projecting 
declining emission intensities while actual observations showed an 
increase. For individual technologies (in particular solar energy), IAM 
projections have been conservative regarding deployment rates and 
cost reductions (Creutzig et al., 2017), suggesting that IAMs do not 
always impute actual rates of technological change resulting from 
influence of shocks, broader changes and mutually reinforcing factors 
in society and politics (Geels and Schot, 2007; Daron et al., 2015; 
Sovacool, 2016; Battiston et al., 2017).
Other studies extrapolate historical trends into the future (Höök et al., 
2011; Fouquet, 2016), or contrast the rates of change associated with 
specific temperature limits in IAMs (such as those in Chapter 2) with 
historical trends to investigate plausibility of emission pathways and 
associated temperature limits (Wilson et al., 2013; Gambhir et al., 2017; 
Napp et al., 2017). When metrics are normalized to gross domestic 
product (GDP; as opposed to other normalization metrics such as 
primary energy), low-emission technology deployment rates used by 
IAMs over the course of the coming century are shown to be broadly 
consistent with past trends, but rates of change in emission intensity 
are typically overestimated (Wilson et al., 2013; Loftus et al., 2014; van 
Sluisveld et al., 2015). This bias is consistent with the findings from 
the ‘validation’ studies cited above, suggesting that IAMs may under-
report the potential for supply-side technological change assumed 
in 1.5°-consistent pathways, but may be more optimistic about the 
systemic ability to realize incremental changes in reduction of emission 
intensity as a consequence of favourable energy efficiency payback 
times (Wilson et al., 2013). This finding suggests that barriers and 
enablers other than costs and climate limits play a role in technological 
change, as also found in the innovation literature (Hekkert et al., 2007; 
Bergek et al., 2008; Geels et al., 2016b). 
One barrier to a greater rate of change in energy systems is that 
economic growth in the past has been coupled to the use of fossil 
fuels. Disruptive innovation and socio-technical changes could enable 
the decoupling of economic growth from a range of environmental 
drivers, including the consumption of fossil fuels, as represented by 
1.5°C-consistent pathways (UNEP, 2014; Newman, 2017). This may 
be relative decoupling due to rebound effects that see financial 
savings generated by renewable energy used in the consumption of 
new products and services (Jackson and Senker, 2011; Gillingham et 
al., 2013), but in 2015 and 2016 total global GHG emissions have 
decoupled absolutely from economic growth (IEA, 2017g; Peters 
et al., 2017). A longer data trend would be needed before stable 
decoupling can be established. The observed decoupling in 2015 
and 2016 was driven by absolute declines in both coal and oil use 
since the early 2000s in Europe, in the past seven years in the United 
States and Australia, and more recently in China (Newman, 2017). 
In 2017, decoupling in China reversed by 2% due to a drought 
and subsequent replacement of hydropower with coal-fired power 
(Tollefson, 2017), but this reversal is expected to be temporary (IEA, 
2017c). Oil consumption in China is still rising slowly, but absolute 
decoupling is ongoing in megacities like Beijing (Gao and Newman, 
2018) (see Box 4.9). 
4.2.2.2 Transformational adaptation
In some regions and places, incremental adaptation would not 
be sufficient to mitigate the impacts of climate change on social-
ecological systems (see Chapter 3). Transformational adaptation 
would then be required (Bahadur and Tanner, 2014; Pant et al., 
2015; Gillard, 2016; Gillard et al., 2016; Colloff et al., 2017; Termeer 
et al., 2017). Transformational adaptation refers to actions aiming 
at adapting to climate change resulting in significant changes in 
structure or function that go beyond adjusting existing practices 
(Dowd et al., 2014; IPCC, 2014a; Few et al., 2017), including 
approaches that enable new ways of decision-making on adaptation 
(Colloff et al., 2017). Few studies have assessed the potentially 
transformative character of adaptation options (Pelling et al., 2015; 
Rippke et al., 2016; Solecki et al., 2017), especially in the context of 
warming of 1.5°C. 
Transformational adaptation can be adopted at a large scale, can lead 
to new strategies in a region or resource system, transform places 
and potentially shift locations (Kates et al., 2012). Some systems 
might require transformational adaptation at 1.5°C. Implementing 
adaptation policies in anticipation of 1.5°C would require 
transformation and flexible planning of adaptation (sometimes 
called adaptation pathways) (Rothman et al., 2014; Smucker et 
al., 2015; Holland, 2017; Gajjar et al., 2018), an understanding of 
the varied stakeholders involved and their motives, and knowledge 
of less visible aspects of vulnerability based on social, cultural, 
political, and economic factors (Holland, 2017). Transformational 
adaptation would seek deep and long-term societal changes that 
influence sustainable development (Chung Tiam Fook, 2017; Few 
et al., 2017). 
Adaptation requires multidisciplinary approaches integrating 
scientific, technological and social dimensions. For example, a 
323
4
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
framework for transformational adaptation and the integration 
of mitigation and adaptation pathways can transform rural 
indigenous communities to address risks of climate change and 
other stressors (Thornton and Comberti, 2017). In villages in rural 
Nepal, transformational adaptation has taken place, with villagers 
changing their agricultural and pastoralist livelihood strategies after 
years of lost crops due to changing rain patterns and degradation 
of natural resources (Thornton and Comberti, 2017). Instead, they 
are now opening stores, hotels, and tea shops. In another case, the 
arrival of an oil pipeline altered traditional Alaskan communities’ 
livelihoods. With growth of oil production, investments were made 
for rural development. A later drop in oil production decreased these 
investments. Alaskan indigenous populations are also dealing with 
impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, which is altering 
their livelihood sources. Transformational adaptation is taking 
place by changing the energy matrix to renewable energy, in which 
indigenous people apply their knowledge to achieve environmental, 
economic, and social benefits (Thornton and Comberti, 2017).
4.2.2.3 Disruptive innovation
Demand-driven disruptive innovations that emerge as the product 
of political and social changes across multiple scales can be 
transformative (Seba, 2014; Christensen et al., 2015; Green and 
Newman, 2017a). Such innovations would lead to simultaneous, 
profound changes in behaviour, economies and societies (Seba, 2014; 
Christensen et al. 2015), but are difficult to predict in supply-focused 
economic models (Geels et al., 2016a; Pindyck, 2017). Rapid socio-
technical change has been observed in the solar industry (Creutzig et 
al. (2017). Similar changes to socio-ecological systems can stimulate 
adaptation and mitigation options that lead to more climate-resilient 
systems (Adger et al., 2005; Ostrom, 2009; Gillard et al., 2016) (see 
the Alaska and Nepal examples in Section 4.2.2.2). The increase in 
roof-top solar and energy storage technology as well as the increase in 
passive housing and net zero-emissions buildings are further examples 
of such disruptions (Green and Newman, 2017b). Both roof-top solar 
and energy storage have benefitted from countries’ economic growth 
strategies and associated price declines in photovoltaic technologies, 
particularly in China (Shrivastava and Persson, 2018), as well as from 
new information and communication technologies (Koomey et al., 
2013), rising demand for electricity in urban areas, and global concern 
regarding greenhouse gas emissions (Azeiteiro and Leal Filho, 2017; 
Lutz and Muttarak, 2017; Wamsler, 2017).
System co-benefits can create the potential for mutually enforcing 
and demand-driven climate responses (Jordan et al., 2015; 
Hallegatte and Mach, 2016; Pelling et al., 2018), and for rapid and 
transformational change (Cole, 2015; Geels et al., 2016b; Hallegatte 
and Mach, 2016). Examples of co-benefits include gender equality, 
agricultural productivity (Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr, 2015), 
reduced indoor air pollution (Satterthwaite and Bartlett, 2017), flood 
buffering (Colenbrander et al., 2017), livelihood support (Shaw et 
al., 2014; Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014), economic growth (GCEC, 2014; 
Stiglitz et al., 2017), social progress (Steg et al., 2015; Hallegatte and 
Mach, 2016) and social justice (Ziervogel et al., 2017; Patterson et 
al., 2018). 
Innovations that disrupt entire systems may leave firms and utilities 
with stranded assets, as the transition can happen very quickly (IPCC, 
2014b; Kossoy et al., 2015). This may have consequences for fossil 
fuels that are rendered ‘unburnable’ (McGlade and Ekins, 2015) and 
fossil fuel-fired power and industry assets that would become obsolete 
(Caldecott, 2017; Farfan and Breyer, 2017). The presence of multiple 
barriers and enablers operating in a system implies that rapid change, 
whether the product of many small changes (Termeer et al., 2017) 
or large-scale disruptions, is seldom an insular or discrete process 
(Sterling et al., 2017). This finding informs the multidimensional nature 
of feasibility in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 which is applied in 
Section 4.5. Climate responses that are aligned with multiple feasibility 
dimensions and combine adaptation and mitigation interventions with 
non-climate benefits can accelerate change and reduce risks and costs 
(Fazey et al., 2018). Also political, social and technological influences on 
energy transitions, for example, can accelerate them faster than narrow 
techno-economic analysis suggests is possible (Kern and Rogge, 2016), 
but could also introduce new constraints and risks (Geels et al., 2016b; 
Sovacool, 2016; Eyre et al., 2018). 
Disruptive innovation and technological change may play a role in 
mitigation and in adaptation. The next section assesses mitigation 
and adaptation options in energy, land and ecosystem, urban and 
infrastructure and industrial systems.
4.3 
Systemic Changes for 1.5°C-Consistent 
Pathways
Section 4.2 emphasizes the importance of systemic change for 
1.5°C-consistent pathways. This section translates this into four 
main system transitions: energy, land and ecosystem, urban and 
infrastructure, and industrial system transitions. This section assesses 
the mitigation, adaptation and carbon dioxide removal options that 
offer the potential for such change within those systems, based on 
options identified by Chapter 2 and risks and impacts in Chapter 3. 
The section puts more emphasis on those adaptation options (Sections 
4.3.1–4.3.5) and mitigation options (Sections 4.3.1–4.3.4, 4.3.6 
and 4.3.7) that are 1.5°C-relevant and have developed considerably 
since AR5. They also form the basis for the mitigation and adaptation 
feasibility assessments in Section 4.5. Section 4.3.8 discusses solar 
radiation modification methods. 
This section emphasizes that no single solution or option can enable a 
global transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways or adapting to projected 
impacts. Rather, accelerating change, much of which is already starting 
or underway, in multiple global systems, simultaneously and at different 
scales, could provide the impetus for these system transitions. The 
feasibility of individual options as well as the potential for synergies 
and reducing trade-offs will vary according to context and the local 
enabling conditions. These are explored at a high level in Section 4.5. 
Policy packages that bring together multiple enabling conditions can 
provide building blocks for a strategy to scale up implementation and 
intervention impacts.

4.3.1 
Energy System Transitions
This section discusses the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation 
options related to the energy system transition. Only options relevant 
to 1.5°C and with significant changes since AR5 are discussed, which 
means that for options like hydropower and geothermal energy, 
the chapter refers to AR5 and does not provide a discussion. Socio-
technical inertia of energy options for 1.5°C-consistent pathways are 
increasingly being surmounted as fossil fuels start to be phased out. 
Supply-side mitigation and adaptation options and energy demand-
side options, including energy efficiency in buildings and transportation, 
are discussed in Section 4.3.3; options around energy use in industry 
are discussed in Section 4.3.4. 
Section 4.5 assesses the feasibility in a systematic manner based on 
the approach outlined in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1.
4.3.1.1 Renewable electricity: solar and wind
All renewable energy options have seen considerable advances over 
the years since AR5, but solar energy and both onshore and offshore 
wind energy have had dramatic growth trajectories. They appear well 
underway to contribute to 1.5°C-consistent pathways (IEA, 2017c; 
IRENA, 2017b; REN21, 2017). 
The largest growth driver for renewable energy since AR5 has been 
the dramatic reduction in the cost of solar photovoltaics (PV) (REN21, 
2017). This has made rooftop solar competitive in sunny areas between 
45° north and south latitude (Green and Newman, 2017b), though 
IRENA (2018) suggests it is cost effective in many other places too. Solar 
PV with batteries has been cost effective in many rural and developing 
areas (Pueyo and Hanna, 2015; Szabó et al., 2016; Jimenez, 2017), 
for example 19 million people in Bangladesh now have solar-battery 
electricity in remote villages and are reporting positive experiences on 
safety and ease of use (Kabir et al., 2017). Small-scale distributed energy 
projects are being implemented in developed and developing cities 
where residential and commercial rooftops offer potential for consumers 
becoming producers (called prosumers) (ACOLA, 2017; Kotilainen and 
Saari, 2018). Such prosumers could contribute significantly to electricity 
generation in sun-rich areas like California (Kurdgelashvili et al., 2016) 
or sub-Saharan Africa in combination with micro-grids and mini-grids 
(Bertheau et al., 2017). It could also contribute to universal energy 
access (SDG 7) as shown by (IEA, 2017c).
The feasibility of renewable energy options depends to a large 
extent on geophysical characteristics of the area where the option is 
implemented. However, technological advances and policy instruments 
make renewable energy options increasingly attractive in other areas. 
For example, solar PV is deployed commercially in areas with low solar 
insolation, like northwest Europe (Nyholm et al., 2017). Feasibility also 
depends on grid adaptations (e.g., storage, see below) as renewables 
grow (IEA, 2017c). For regions with high energy needs, such as 
industrial areas (see Section 4.3.4), high-voltage DC transmission 
across long distances would be needed (MacDonald et al., 2016). 
Another important factor affecting feasibility is public acceptance, in 
particular for wind energy and other large-scale renewable facilities 
(Yenneti and Day, 2016; Rand and Hoen, 2017; Gorayeb et al., 2018) 
that raise landscape management (Nadaï and Labussière, 2017) and 
distributional justice (Yenneti and Day, 2016) challenges. Research 
indicates that financial participation and community engagement can 
be effective in mitigating resistance (Brunes and Ohlhorst, 2011; Rand 
and Hoen, 2017) (see Section 4.4.3). 
Bottom-up studies estimating the use of renewable energy in the future, 
either at the global or at the national level, are plentiful, especially in 
the grey literature. It is hotly debated whether a fully renewable energy 
or electricity system, with or without biomass, is possible (Jacobson et 
al., 2015, 2017) or not (Clack et al., 2017; Heard et al., 2017), and by 
what year. Scale-up estimates vary with assumptions about costs and 
technological maturity, as well as local geographical circumstances 
and the extent of storage used (Ghorbani et al., 2017; REN21, 2017). 
Several countries have adopted targets of 100% renewable electricity 
(IEA, 2017c) as this meets multiple social, economic and environmental 
goals and contributes to mitigation of climate change (REN21, 2017).
4.3.1.2 Bioenergy and biofuels
Bioenergy is renewable energy from biomass. Biofuel is biomass-based 
energy used in transport. Chapter 2 suggests that pathways limiting 
warming to 1.5°C would enable supply of 67–310 (median 150) 
EJ yr−1 (see Table 2.8) from biomass. Most scenarios find that bioenergy 
is combined with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS, BECCS) if it 
is available but also find robust deployment of bioenergy independent 
of the availability of CCS (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4.2 and Section 
4.3.7 for a discussion of BECCS). Detailed assessments indicate that 
deployment is similar for pathways limiting global warming to below 
2°C (Chum et al., 2011; P. Smith et al., 2014; Creutzig et al., 2015b). 
There is however high agreement that the sustainable bioenergy 
potential in 2050 would be restricted to around 100 EJ yr−1 (Slade 
et al., 2014; Creutzig et al., 2015b). Sustainable deployment at such 
or higher levels envisioned by 1.5°C-consistent pathways may put 
significant pressure on available land, food production and prices 
(Popp et al., 2014b; Persson, 2015; Kline et al., 2017; Searchinger et 
al., 2017), preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity (Creutzig et 
al., 2015b; Holland et al., 2015; Santangeli et al., 2016), and potential 
water and nutrient constraints (Gerbens-Leenes et al., 2009; Gheewala 
et al., 2011; Bows and Smith, 2012; Smith and Torn, 2013; Bonsch et 
al., 2016; Lampert et al., 2016; Mouratiadou et al., 2016; Smith et al., 
2016b; Wei et al., 2016; Mathioudakis et al., 2017); but there is still low 
agreement on these interactions (Robledo-Abad et al., 2017). Some 
of the disagreement on the sustainable capacity for bioenergy stems 
from global versus local assessments. Global assessments may mask 
local dynamics that exacerbate negative impacts and shortages while 
at the same time niche contexts for deployment may avoid trade-offs 
and exploit co-benefits more effectively. In some regions of the world 
(e.g., the case of Brazilian ethanol, see Box 4.7, where land may be less 
of a constraint, the use of bioenergy is mature and the industry is well 
developed), land transitions could be balanced with food production 
and biodiversity to enable a global impact on CO2 emissions (Jaiswal 
et al., 2017).
The carbon intensity of bioenergy, key for both bioenergy as an 
emission-neutral energy option and BECCS as a CDR measure, is 
325

Chapter 4
still a matter of debate (Buchholz et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018) and 
depends on management (Pyörälä et al., 2014; Torssonen et al., 2016; 
Baul et al., 2017; Kilpeläinen et al., 2017); direct and indirect land-use 
change emissions (Plevin et al., 2010; Schulze et al., 2012; Harris et 
al., 2015; Repo et al., 2015; DeCicco et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2016)2; the 
feedstock considered; and time frame (Zanchi et al., 2012; Daioglou et 
al., 2017; Booth, 2018; Sterman et al., 2018), as well as the availability 
of coordinated policies and management to minimize negative 
side effects and trade-offs, particularly those around food security 
(Stevanović et al., 2017) and livelihood and equity considerations 
(Creutzig et al., 2013; Calvin et al., 2014) .
Biofuels are a part of the transport sector in some cities and countries, 
and may be deployed as a mitigation option for aviation, shipping 
and freight transport (see Section 4.3.3.5) as well as industrial 
decarbonization (IEA, 2017g) (Section 4.3.4), though only Brazil has 
mainstreamed ethanol as a substantial, commercial option. Lower 
emissions and reduced urban air pollution have been achieved there 
by use of ethanol and biodiesel as fuels (Hill et al., 2006; Salvo et al., 
2017) (see Box 4.7).
4.3.1.3 Nuclear energy
Many scenarios in Chapter 2 and in AR5 (Bruckner et al., 2014) 
project an increase in the use of nuclear power, while others project 
a decrease. The increase can be realized through existing mature 
nuclear technologies or new options (generation III/IV reactors, 
breeder reactors, new uranium and thorium fuel cycles, small reactors 
or nuclear cogeneration).  
Even though scalability and speed of scaling of nuclear plants have 
historically been high in many nations, such rates are currently not 
achieved anymore. In the 1960s and 1970s, France implemented a 
programme to rapidly get 80% of its power from nuclear in about 
25 years (IAEA, 2018), but the current time lag between the decision 
date and the commissioning of plants is observed to be 10-19 years 
(Lovins et al., 2018). The current deployment pace of nuclear energy is 
constrained by social acceptability in many countries due to concerns 
over risks of accidents and radioactive waste management (Bruckner 
et al., 2014). Though comparative risk assessment shows health risks 
are low per unit of electricity production (Hirschberg et al., 2016), and 
land requirement is lower than that of other power sources (Cheng and 
Hammond, 2017), the political processes triggered by societal concerns 
depend on the country-specific means of managing the political 
debates around technological choices and their environmental impacts 
(Gregory et al., 1993). Such differences in perception explain why the 
2011 Fukushima incident resulted in a confirmation or acceleration of 
phasing out nuclear energy in five countries (Roh, 2017) while 30 other 
countries have continued using nuclear energy, amongst which 13 are 
building new nuclear capacity, including China, India and the United 
Kingdom (IAEA, 2017; Yuan et al., 2017). 
Costs of nuclear power have increased over time in some developed 
nations, principally due to market conditions where increased 
investment risks of high-capital expenditure technologies have 
become significant. ‘Learning by doing’ processes often failed to 
compensate for this trend because they were slowed down by the 
absence of standardization and series effects (Grubler, 2010). What 
the costs of nuclear power are and have been is debated in the 
literature (Lovering et al., 2016; Koomey et al., 2017). Countries with 
liberalized markets that continue to develop nuclear employ de-risking 
instruments through long-term contracts with guaranteed sale prices 
(Finon and Roques, 2013). For instance, the United Kingdom works 
with public guarantees covering part of the upfront investment costs 
of newly planned nuclear capacity. This dynamic differs in countries 
such as China and South Korea, where monopolistic conditions in 
the electric system allow for reducing investment risks, deploying 
series effects and enhancing the engineering capacities of users 
due to stable relations between the security authorities and builders 
(Schneider et al., 2017).
The safety of nuclear plants depends upon the public authorities of 
each country. However, because accidents affect worldwide public 
acceptance of this industry, questions have been raised about the risk 
of economic and political pressures weakening the safety of the plants 
(Finon, 2013; Budnitz, 2016). This raises the issue of international 
governance of civil nuclear risks and reinforced international 
cooperation involving governments, companies and engineering 
(Walker and Lönnroth, 1983; Thomas, 1988; Finon, 2013), based on the 
experience of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
4.3.1.4 Energy storage 
The growth in electricity storage for renewables has been around grid 
flexibility resources (GFR) that would enable several places to source 
more than half their power from non-hydro renewables (Komarnicki, 
2016). Ten types of GFRs within smart grids have been developed 
(largely since AR5)(Blaabjerg et al., 2004; IRENA, 2013; IEA, 2017d; 
Majzoobi and Khodaei, 2017), though how variable renewables 
can be balanced  without hydro or natural gas-based power back-
up at a larger scale would still need demonstration. Pumped hydro 
comprised 150 GW of storage capacity in 2016, and grid-connected 
battery storage just 1.7 GW, but the latter grew between 2015 to 
2016 by 50% (REN21, 2017). Battery storage has been the main 
growth feature in energy storage since AR5 (Breyer et al., 2017). 
This appears to the result of significant cost reductions due to mass 
production for electric vehicles (EVs) (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015; Dhar 
et al., 2017). Although costs and technical maturity look increasingly 
positive, the feasibility of battery storage is challenged by concerns 
over the availability of resources and the environmental impacts of 
its production (Peters et al., 2017). Lithium, a common element in 
the earth’s crust, does not appear to be restricted and large increases 
in production have happened in recent years with eight new mines 
in Western Australia where most lithium is produced (GWA, 2016). 
Emerging battery technologies may provide greater efficiency and 
recharge rates (Belmonte et al., 2016) but remain significantly more 
expensive due to speed and scale issues compared to lithium ion 
batteries (Dhar et al., 2017; IRENA, 2017a).
2 
While there is high agreement that indirect land use change (iLUC) could occur, there is low agreement about the actual extent of iLUC (P. Smith et al., 2014; Verstegen et 
al., 2015; Zilberman, 2017)
326
Chapter 4 
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response

Research and demonstration of energy storage in the form of thermal 
and chemical systems continues, but large-scale commercial systems 
are rare (Pardo et al., 2014). Renewably derived synthetic liquid (like 
methanol and ammonia) and gas (like methane and hydrogen) are 
increasingly being seen as a feasible storage options for renewable 
energy (producing fuel for use in industry during times when solar 
and wind are abundant) (Bruce et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2010; Ezeji, 
2017) but, in the case of carbonaceous storage media, would need a 
renewable source of carbon to make a positive contribution to GHG 
reduction (von der Assen et al., 2013; Abanades et al., 2017) (see also 
Section 4.3.4.5). The use of electric vehicles as a form of storage has 
been modelled and evaluated as an opportunity, and demonstrations 
are emerging (Dhar et al., 2017; Green and Newman, 2017a), but 
challenges to upscaling remain.
4.3.1.5 Options for adapting electricity systems to 1.5°C  
Climate change has started to disrupt electricity generation and, if 
climate change adaptation options are not considered, it is predicted 
that these disruptions will be lengthier and more frequent (Jahandideh-
Tehrani et al., 2014; Bartos and Chester, 2015; Kraucunas et al., 2015; 
van Vliet et al., 2016). Adaptation would both secure vulnerable 
infrastructure and ensure the necessary generation capacity (Minville 
et al., 2009; Eisenack and Stecker, 2012; Schaeffer et al., 2012; Cortekar 
and Groth, 2015; Murrant et al., 2015; Panteli and Mancarella, 2015; 
Goytia et al., 2016). The literature shows high agreement that climate 
change impacts need to be planned for in the design of any kind of 
infrastructure, especially in the energy sector (Nierop, 2014), including 
interdependencies with other sectors that require electricity to function, 
including water, data, telecommunications and transport (Fryer, 2017). 
Recent research has developed new frameworks and models that 
aim to assess and identify vulnerabilities in energy infrastructure 
and create more proactive responses (Francis and Bekera, 2014; 
Ouyang and Dueñas-Osorio, 2014; Arab et al., 2015; Bekera and 
Francis, 2015; Knight et al., 2015; Jeong and An, 2016; Panteli et al., 
2016; Perrier, 2016; Erker et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2017). Assessments of 
energy infrastructure adaptation, while limited, emphasize the need 
for redundancy (Liu et al., 2017). The implementation of  controllable 
and islandable microgrids, including the use of residential batteries, 
can increase resiliency, especially after extreme weather events (Qazi 
and Young Jr., 2014; Liu et al., 2017). Hybrid renewables-based power 
systems with non-hydro capacity, such as with high-penetration wind 
generation, could provide the required system flexibility (Canales et 
al., 2015). Overall, there is high agreement that hybrid systems, taking 
advantage of an array of sources and time of use strategies, can help 
make electricity generation more resilient (Parkinson and Djilali, 2015), 
given that energy security standards are in place (Almeida Prado et 
al., 2016).
Interactions between water and energy are complex (IEA, 2017g). 
Water scarcity patterns and electricity disruptions will differ across 
regions. There is high agreement that mitigation and adaptation 
options for thermal electricity generation (if that remains fitted with 
CCS) need to consider increasing water shortages, taking into account 
other factors such as ambient water resources and demand changes in 
irrigation water (Hayashi et al., 2018). Increasing the efficiency of power 
plants can reduce emissions and water needs (Eisenack and Stecker, 
2012; van Vliet et al., 2016), but applying CCS would increase water 
consumption (Koornneef et al., 2012). The technological, economic, 
social and institutional feasibility of efficiency improvements is high, 
but insufficient to limit temperature rise to 1.5°C (van Vliet et al., 2016).
In addition, a number of options for water cooling management 
systems have been proposed, such as hydraulic measures (Eisenack 
and Stecker, 2012) and alternative cooling technologies (Chandel et al., 
2011; Eisenack and Stecker, 2012; Bartos and Chester, 2015; Murrant 
et al., 2015; Bustamante et al., 2016; van Vliet et al., 2016; Huang et al., 
2017b). There is high agreement on the technological and economic 
feasibility of these technologies, as their absence can severely impact 
the functioning of the power plant as well as safety and security 
standards.
4.3.1.6 Carbon dioxide capture and storage in the power sector  
The AR5 (IPCC, 2014b) as well as Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2, assign 
significant emission reductions over the course of this century to CO2 
capture and storage (CCS) in the power sector. This section focuses 
on CCS in the fossil-fuelled power sector; Section 4.3.4 discusses 
CCS in non-power industry, and Section 4.3.7 discusses bioenergy 
with CCS (BECCS). Section 2.4.2 puts the cumulative CO2 stored 
from fossil-fuelled power at 410 (199–470 interquartile range) GtCO2 
over this century. Such modelling suggests that CCS in the power 
sector can contribute to cost-effective achievement of emission 
reduction requirements for limiting warming to 1.5°C. CCS may also 
offer employment and political advantages for fossil fuel-dependent 
economies (Kern et al., 2016), but may entail more limited co-benefits 
than other mitigation options (that, e.g., generate power) and therefore 
relies on climate policy incentives for its business case and economic 
feasibility. Since 2017, two CCS projects in the power sector capture 
2.4 MtCO2 annually, while 30 MtCO2 is captured annually in all CCS 
projects (Global CCS Institute, 2017). 
The technological maturity of CO2 capture options in the power sectors 
has improved considerably (Abanades et al., 2015; Bui et al., 2018), 
but costs have not come down between 2005 and 2015 due to limited 
learning in commercial settings and increased energy and resources 
costs (Rubin et al., 2015). Storage capacity estimates vary greatly, but 
Section 2.4.2 as well as literature (V. Scott et al., 2015) indicate that 
perhaps 10,000 GtCO2 could be stored in underground reservoirs. 
Regional availability of this may not be sufficient, and it requires 
efforts to have this storage and the corresponding infrastructure 
available at the necessary rates and times (de Coninck and Benson, 
2014). CO2 retention in the storage reservoir was recently assessed 
as 98% over 10,000 years for well-managed reservoirs, and 78% 
for poorly regulated ones (Alcalde et al., 2018).  A paper reviewing 
42 studies on public perception of CCS (Seigo et al., 2014) found that 
social acceptance of CCS is predicted by trust, perceived risks and 
benefits. The technology itself mattered less than the social context of 
the project. Though insights on communication of CCS projects to the 
general public and inhabitants of the area around the CO2 storage sites 
have been documented over the years, project stakeholders are not 
consistently implementing these lessons, although some projects have 
observed good practices (Ashworth et al., 2015).

Chapter 4
CCS in the power sector is hardly being realized at scale, mainly 
because the incremental costs of capture, and the development of 
transport and storage infrastructures are not sufficiently compensated 
by market or government incentives (IEA, 2017c). In the two full-scale 
projects in the power sector mentioned above, part of the capture costs 
are compensated for by revenues from enhanced oil recovery (EOR) 
(Global CCS Institute, 2017), demonstrating that EOR helps developing 
CCS further. EOR is a technique that uses CO2 to mobilize more oil 
out of depleting oil fields, leading to additional CO2 emissions by 
combusting the additionally recovered oil (Cooney et al., 2015). 
4.3.2 
Land and Ecosystem Transitions
This section assesses the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options 
related to land use and ecosystems. Land transitions are grouped around 
agriculture and food, ecosystems and forests, and coastal systems. 
4.3.2.1 Agriculture and food
In a 1.5°C world, local yields are projected to decrease in tropical 
regions that are major food producing areas of the world (West Africa, 
Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central and northern South America) 
(Schleussner et al., 2016). Some high-latitude regions may benefit from 
the combined effects of elevated CO2 and temperature because their 
average temperatures are below optimal temperature for crops. In both 
cases there are consequences for food production and quality (Cross-
Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3 on Food Security), conservation agriculture, 
irrigation, food wastage, bioenergy and the use of novel technologies.
Food production and quality. Increased temperatures, including 
1.5°C warming, would affect the production of cereals such as wheat 
and rice, impacting food security (Schleussner et al., 2016). There is 
medium agreement that elevated CO2 concentrations can change food 
composition, with implications for nutritional security (Taub et al., 
2008; Högy et al., 2009; DaMatta et al., 2010; Loladze, 2014; De Souza 
et al., 2015), with the effects being different depending on the region 
(Medek et al., 2017).
Meta-analyses of the effects of drought, elevated CO2, and temperature 
conclude that at 2°C local warming and above, aggregate production of 
wheat, maize, and rice are expected to decrease in both temperate and 
tropical areas (Challinor et al., 2014). These production losses could be 
lowered if adaptation measures are taken (Challinor et al., 2014), such 
as developing varieties better adapted to changing climate conditions. 
Adaptation options can help ensure access to sufficient, quality food. 
Such options include conservation agriculture, improved livestock 
management, increasing irrigation efficiency, agroforestry and 
management of food loss and waste. Complementary adaptation and 
mitigation options, for example, the use of climate services (Section 
4.3.5), bioenergy (Section 4.3.1) and biotechnology (Section 4.4.4) can 
also serve to reduce emissions intensity and the carbon footprint of food 
production.
Conservation agriculture (CA) is a soil management approach 
that reduces the disruption of soil structure and biotic processes by 
minimising tillage. A recent meta-analysis showed that no-till practices 
work well in water-limited agroecosystems when implemented jointly 
with residue retention and crop rotation, but when used independently, 
may decrease yields in other situations (Pittelkow et al., 2014). 
Additional climate adaptations include adjusting planting times and 
crop varietal selection and improving irrigation efficiency. Adaptations 
such as these may increase wheat and maize yields by 7–12% under 
climate change (Challinor et al., 2014). CA can also help build adaptive 
capacity (medium evidence, medium agreement) (H. Smith et al., 2017; 
Pradhan et al., 2018) and have mitigation co-benefits through improved 
fertiliser use or efficient use of machinery and fossil fuels (Harvey et al., 
2014; Cui et al., 2018; Pradhan et al., 2018). CA practices can also raise 
soil carbon and therefore remove CO2 from the atmosphere (Aguilera 
et al., 2013; Poeplau and Don, 2015; Vicente-Vicente et al., 2016). 
However, CA adoption can be constrained by inadequate institutional 
arrangements and funding mechanisms (Harvey et al., 2014; Baudron 
et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Dougill et al., 2017; H. Smith et al., 2017).
Sustainable intensification of agriculture consists of agricultural 
systems with increased production per unit area but with management 
of the range of potentially adverse impacts on the environment (Pretty 
and Bharucha, 2014). Sustainable intensification can increase the 
efficiency of inputs and enhance health and food security (Ramankutty 
et al., 2018).
Livestock management. Livestock are responsible for more GHG 
emissions than all other food sources. Emissions are caused by feed 
production, enteric fermentation, animal waste, land-use change 
and livestock transport and processing. Some estimates indicate that 
livestock supply chains could account for 7.1 GtCO2 per year, equivalent 
to 14.5% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Gerber 
et al., 2013). Cattle (beef, milk) are responsible for about two-thirds 
of that total, largely due to methane emissions resulting from rumen 
fermentation (Gerber et al., 2013; Opio et al., 2013). 
Despite ongoing gains in livestock productivity and volumes, the 
increase of animal products in global diets is restricting overall 
agricultural efficiency gains because of inefficiencies in the conversion 
of agricultural primary production (e.g., crops) in the feed-animal 
products pathway (Alexander et al., 2017), offsetting the benefits of 
improvements in livestock production systems (Clark and Tilman, 2017). 
There is increasing agreement that overall emissions from food systems 
could be reduced by targeting the demand for meat and other livestock 
products, particularly where consumption is higher than suggested 
by human health guidelines. Adjusting diets to meet nutritional 
targets could bring large co-benefits, through GHG mitigation and 
improvements in the overall efficiency of food systems (Erb et al., 2009; 
Tukker et al., 2011; Tilman and Clark, 2014; van Dooren et al., 2014; 
Ranganathan et al., 2016). Dietary shifts could contribute one-fifth of 
the mitigation needed to hold warming below 2°C, with one-quarter of 
low-cost options (Griscom et al., 2017). There, however, remains limited 
evidence of effective policy interventions to achieve such large-scale 
shifts in dietary choices, and prevailing trends are for increasing rather 
than decreasing demand for livestock products at the global scale 
(Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012; OECD/FAO, 2017). How the role 
of dietary shift could change in 1.5°C-consistent pathways is also not 
clear (see Chapter 2).

Adaptation of livestock systems can include a suite of strategies such 
as using different breeds and their wild relatives to develop a genetic 
pool resilient to climatic shocks and longer-term temperature shifts 
(Thornton and Herrero, 2014), improving fodder and feed management 
(Bell et al., 2014; Havet et al., 2014) and disease prevention and control 
(Skuce et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2016). Most interventions that 
improve the productivity of livestock systems and enhance adaptation 
to climate changes would also reduce the emissions intensity of food 
production, with significant co-benefits for rural livelihoods and the 
security of food supplies (Gerber et al., 2013; FAO and NZAGRC, 2017a, 
b, c). Whether such reductions in emission intensity result in lower 
or higher absolute GHG emissions depends on overall demand for 
livestock products, indicating the relevance of integrating supply-side 
with demand-side measures within food security objectives (Gerber 
et al., 2013; Bajželj et al., 2014). Transitions in livestock production 
systems (e.g., from extensive to intensive) can also result in significant 
emission reductions as part of broader land-based mitigation strategies 
(Havlik et al., 2014).
Overall, there is high agreement that farm strategies that integrate 
mixed crop–livestock systems can improve farm productivity and 
have positive sustainability outcomes (Havet et al., 2014; Thornton 
and Herrero, 2014; Herrero et al., 2015; Weindl et al., 2015). Shifting 
towards mixed crop–livestock systems is estimated to reduce 
agricultural adaptation costs to 0.3% of total production costs while 
abating deforestation by 76 Mha globally, making it a highly cost-
effective adaptation option with mitigation co-benefits (Weindl et 
al., 2015). Evidence from various regions supports this (Thornton and 
Herrero, 2015), although the feasible scale varies between regions and 
systems, as well as being moderated by overall demand in specific 
food products. In Australia, some farmers have successfully shifted 
to crop–livestock systems where, each year, they allocate land and 
forage resources in response to climate and price trends (Bell et al., 
2014) . However, there can be some unintended negative impacts 
of such integration, including increased burdens on women, higher 
requirements of capital, competing uses of crop residues (e.g., feed 
vs. mulching vs. carbon sequestration) and higher requirements 
of management skills, which can be a challenge across several low 
income countries (Thornton and Herrero, 2015; Thornton et al., 2018). 
Finally, the feasibility of improving livestock efficiency is dependent 
on socio-cultural context and acceptability: there remain significant 
issues around widespread adoption of crossbred animals, especially by 
smallholders (Thornton et al., 2018).  
Irrigation efficiency. Irrigation efficiency is especially critical since 
water endowments are expected to change, with  20–60 Mha of 
global cropland being projected to revert from irrigated to rain-fed 
land, while other areas will receive higher precipitation in shorter time 
spans, thus affecting irrigation demand (Elliott et al., 2014). While 
increasing irrigation system efficiency is necessary, there is mixed 
evidence on how to enact efficiency improvements (Fader et al., 2016; 
Herwehe and Scott, 2018). Physical and technical strategies include 
building large-scale reservoirs or dams, renovating or deepening 
irrigation channels, building on-farm rainwater harvesting structures, 
lining ponds, channels and tanks to reduce losses through percolation 
and evaporation, and investing in small infrastructure such as sprinkler 
or drip irrigation sets (Varela-Ortega et al., 2016; Sikka et al., 2018). 
Each strategy has differing costs and benefits relating to unique 
biophysical, social, and economic contexts. Also, increasing irrigation 
efficiency may foster higher dependency on irrigation, resulting in a 
heightened sensitivity to climate that may be maladaptive in the long 
term (Lindoso et al., 2014).
Improvements in irrigation efficiency would need to be supplemented 
with ancillary activities, such as shifting to crops that require less water 
and improving soil and moisture conservation (Fader et al., 2016; 
Hong and Yabe, 2017; Sikka et al., 2018). Currently, the feasibility of 
improving irrigation efficiency is constrained by issues of replicability 
across scale and sustainability over time (Burney and Naylor, 2012), 
institutional barriers and inadequate market linkages (Pittock et al., 
2017). 
Growing evidence suggests that investing in behavioural shifts 
towards using irrigation technology such as micro-sprinklers or drip 
irrigation, is an effective and quick adaptation strategy (Varela-Ortega 
et al., 2016; Herwehe and Scott, 2018; Sikka et al., 2018) as opposed 
to large dams which have high financial, ecological and social costs 
(Varela-Ortega et al., 2016). While improving irrigation efficiency is 
technically feasible (R. Fishman et al., 2015) and has clear benefits for 
environmental values (Pfeiffer and Lin, 2014; R. Fishman et al., 2015), 
feasibility is regionally differentiated as shown by examples as diverse 
as Kansas (Jägermeyr et al., 2015), India (R. Fishman et al., 2015) and 
Africa (Pittock et al., 2017).  
Agroforestry. The integration of trees and shrubs into crop and 
livestock systems, when properly managed, can potentially restrict soil 
erosion, facilitate water infiltration, improve soil physical properties 
and buffer against extreme events (Lasco et al., 2014; Mbow et al., 
2014; Quandt et al., 2017; Sida et al., 2018). There is medium evidence 
and high agreement on the feasibility of agroforestry practices that 
enhance productivity, livelihoods and carbon storage (Lusiana et al., 
2012; Murthy, 2013; Coulibaly et al., 2017; Sida et al., 2018), including 
from indigenous production systems (Coq-Huelva et al., 2017), with 
variation by region, agroforestry type, and climatic conditions (Place 
et al., 2012; Coe et al., 2014; Mbow et al., 2014; Iiyama et al., 2017; 
Abdulai et al., 2018). Long-term studies examining the success of 
agroforestry, however, are rare (Coe et al., 2014; Meijer et al., 2015; 
Brockington et al., 2016; Zomer et al., 2016). 
The extent to which agroforestry practices employed at the farm level 
could be scaled up globally while satisfying growing food demand 
is relatively unknown. Agroforestry adoption has been relatively low 
and uneven (Jacobi et al., 2017; Hernández-Morcillo et al., 2018), with 
constraints including the expense of establishment and lack of reliable 
financial support, insecure land tenure, landowner’s lack of experience 
with trees, complexity of management practices, fluctuating market 
demand and prices for different food and fibre products, the time and 
knowledge required for management, low intermediate benefits to 
offset revenue lags, and inadequate market access (Pattanayak et al., 
2003; Mercer, 2004; Sendzimir et al., 2011; Valdivia et al., 2012; Coe et 
al., 2014; Meijer et al., 2015; Coulibaly et al., 2017; Jacobi et al., 2017).
Managing food loss and waste. The way food is produced, 
processed and transported strongly influences GHG emissions. Around 
329
4
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
one-third of the food produced on the planet is not consumed (FAO, 
2013), affecting food security and livelihoods (See Cross-Chapter Box 
6 on Food Security in Chapter 3). Food wastage is a combination 
of food loss – the decrease in mass and nutritional value of food 
due to poor infrastructure, logistics, and lack of storage technologies 
and management – and food waste that derives from inappropriate 
human consumption that leads to food spoilage associated with 
inferior quality or overproduction. Food wastage could lead to an 
increase in emissions estimated to 1.9–2.5 GtCO2-eq yr−1 (Hiç et al., 
2016). 
Decreasing food wastage has high mitigation and adaptation potential 
and could play an important role in land transitions towards 1.5°C, 
provided that reduced food waste results in lower production-side 
emissions rather than increased consumption (Foley et al., 2011). There 
is medium agreement that a combination of individual–institutional 
behaviour (Refsgaard and Magnussen, 2009; Thornton and Herrero, 
2014), and improved technologies and management (Lin et al., 2013; 
Papargyropoulou et al., 2014) can transform food waste into products 
with marketable value. Institutional behaviour depends on investment 
and policies, which if adequately addressed could enable mitigation 
and adaptation co-benefits in a relatively short time.
Novel technologies. New molecular biology tools have been 
developed that can lead to fast and precise genome modification (De 
Souza et al., 2016; Scheben et al., 2016) (e.g., CRISPR Cas9; Ran et 
al., 2013; Schaeffer and Nakata, 2015). Such genome editing tools 
may moderately assist in mitigation and adaptation of agriculture 
in relation to climate changes, elevated CO2, drought and flooding 
(DaMatta et al., 2010; De Souza et al., 2015, 2016). These tools could 
contribute to developing new plant varieties that can adapt to warming 
of 1.5°C and overshoot, potentially avoiding some of the costs of crop 
shifting (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; De Souza et al., 2016). However, 
biosafety concerns and government regulatory systems can be a major 
barrier to the use of these tools as this increases the time and cost 
of turning scientific discoveries into ready applicable technologies 
(Andow and Zwahlen, 2006; Maghari and Ardekani, 2011).
The strategy of reducing enteric methane emissions by ruminants 
through the development of inhibitors or vaccines has already been 
attempted with some successes, although the potential for application 
at scale and in different situations remains uncertain. A methane 
inhibitor has been demonstrated to reduce methane from feedlot 
systems by 30% over a 12-week period (Hristov et al., 2015) with 
some productivity benefits, but the ability to apply it in grazing systems 
will depend on further technological developments as well as costs 
and incentives. A vaccine could potentially modify the microbiota of 
the rumen and be applicable even in extensive grazing systems by 
reducing the presence of methanogenic micro-organisms (Wedlock et 
al., 2013) but has not yet been successfully demonstrated to reduce 
emissions in live animals. Selective breeding for lower-emitting 
ruminants is becoming rapidly feasible, offering small but cumulative 
emissions reductions without requiring substantial changes in farm 
systems (Pickering et al., 2015).
Technological innovation in culturing marine and freshwater micro 
and macro flora has significant potential to expand food, fuel and 
fibre resources, and could reduce impacts on land and conventional 
agriculture (Greene et al., 2017).
Technological innovation could assist in increased agricultural efficiency 
(e.g., via precision agriculture), decrease food wastage and genetics 
that enhance plant adaptation traits (Section 4.4.4). Technological and 
associated management improvements may be ways to increase the 
efficiency of contemporary agriculture to help produce enough food 
to cope with population increases in a 1.5°C warmer world, and help 
reduce the pressure on natural ecosystems and biodiversity.
4.3.2.2 Forests and other ecosystems
Ecosystem restoration. Biomass stocks in tropical, subtropical, 
temperate and boreal biomes currently hold 1085, 194, 176, 190 Gt CO2, 
respectively. Conservation and restoration can enhance these natural 
carbon sinks (Erb et al., 2017). 
Recent studies explore options for conservation, restoration and 
improved land management estimating up to 23 GtCO2 (Griscom et 
al., 2017). Mitigation potentials are dominated by reduced rates of 
deforestation, reforestation and forest management, and concentrated 
in tropical regions (Houghton, 2013; Canadell and Schulze, 2014; Grace 
et al., 2014; Houghton et al., 2015; Griscom et al., 2017). Much of the 
literature focuses on REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and 
forest degradation) as an institutional mechanism. However, restoration 
and management activities need not be limited to REDD+, and locally 
adapted implementation may keep costs low, capitalize on co-benefits 
and ensure consideration of competing for socio-economic goals (Jantke 
et al., 2016; Ellison et al., 2017; Perugini et al., 2017; Spencer et al., 2017).
Half of the estimated potential can be achieved at <100 USD/tCO2; and 
a third of the cost-effective potential at <10 USD/tCO2 (Griscom et al., 
2017). Variation of costs in projects aiming to reduce emissions from 
deforestation is high when considering opportunity and transaction 
costs (Dang Phan et al., 2014; Overmars et al., 2014; Ickowitz et al., 
2017; Rakatama et al., 2017).
However, the focus on forests raises concerns of cross-biome leakage 
(medium evidence, low agreement) (Popp et al., 2014a; Strassburg 
et al., 2014; Jayachandran et al., 2017) and encroachment on other 
ecosystems (Veldman et al., 2015). Reducing rates of deforestation 
constrains the land available for agriculture and grazing, with trade-
offs between diets, higher yields and food prices (Erb et al., 2016a; 
Kreidenweis et al., 2016). Forest restoration and conservation are 
compatible with biodiversity (Rey Benayas et al., 2009; Jantke et al., 
2016) and available water resources; in the tropics, reducing rates of 
deforestation maintains cooler surface temperatures (Perugini et al., 
2017) and rainfall (Ellison et al., 2017). 
Its multiple potential co-benefits have made REDD+ important for local 
communities, biodiversity and sustainable landscapes (Ngendakumana 
et al., 2017; Turnhout et al., 2017). There is low agreement on whether 
climate impacts will reverse mitigation benefits of restoration (Le Page 
et al., 2013) by increasing the likelihood of disturbance (Anderegg et 
al., 2015), or reinforce them through carbon fertilization (P. Smith et 
al., 2014).
330
Chapter 4 
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response

Emerging regional assessments offer new perspectives for upscaling. 
Strengthening coordination, additional funding sources, and access 
and disbursement points increase the potential of REDD+ in working 
towards 2°C and 1.5°C limits (Well and Carrapatoso, 2017). While 
there are indications that land tenure has a positive impact (Sunderlin 
et al., 2014), a meta-analysis by Wehkamp et al. (2018a) shows that 
there is medium evidence and low agreement on which aspects of 
governance improvements are supportive of conservation. Local 
benefits, especially for indigenous communities, will only be accrued if 
land tenure is respected and legally protected, which is not often the 
case (Sunderlin et al., 2014; Brugnach et al., 2017). Although payments 
for reduced rates of deforestation may benefit the poor, the most 
vulnerable populations could have limited, uneven access (Atela et al., 
2014) and face lower opportunity costs from deforestation (Ickowitz 
et al., 2017).
Community-based adaptation (CbA). There is medium evidence 
and high agreement for the use of CbA. The specific actions to take 
will depend upon the location, context, and vulnerability of the specific 
community. CbA is defined as ‘a community-led process, based on 
communities’ priorities, needs, knowledge, and capacities, which aim 
to empower people to plan for and cope with the impacts of climate 
change’ (Reid et al., 2009). The integration of CbA with ecosystems-
based adaptation (EbA) has been increasingly promoted, especially in 
efforts to alleviate poverty (Mannke, 2011; Reid, 2016).
Despite the potential and advantages of both CbA and EbA, including 
knowledge exchange, information access and increased social capital 
and equity; institutional and governance barriers still constitute a 
challenge for local adaptation efforts (Wright et al., 2014; Fernández-
Giménez et al., 2015).
Wetland management. In wetland ecosystems, temperature rise has 
direct and irreversible impacts on species functioning and distribution, 
ecosystem equilibrium and services, and second-order impacts on local 
livelihoods (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4.3). The structure and function 
of wetland systems are changing due to climate change. Wetland 
management strategies, including adjustments in infrastructural, 
behavioural, and institutional practices have clear implications for 
adaptation (Colloff et al., 2016b; Finlayson et al., 2017; Wigand et al., 
2017) 
Despite international initiatives on wetland restoration and 
management through the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, policies 
have not been effective (Finlayson, 2012; Finlayson et al., 2017). 
Institutional reform, such as flexible, locally relevant governance, 
drawing on principles of adaptive co-management, and multi-
stakeholder participation becomes increasingly necessary for effective 
wetland management (Capon et al., 2013; Finlayson et al., 2017).
4.3.2.3 Coastal systems
Managing coastal stress. Particularly to allow for the landward 
relocation of coastal ecosystems under a transition to a 1.5°C warmer 
world, planning for climate change would need to be integrated with 
the use of coastlines by humans (Saunders et al., 2014; Kelleway et al., 
2017). Adaptation options for managing coastal stress include coastal 
hardening through the building of seawalls and the re-establishment 
of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves (André et al., 2016; Cooper 
et al., 2016). While the feasibility of the solutions is high, they are 
expensive to scale (robust evidence, medium agreement).  
There is low evidence and high agreement that reducing the impact 
of local stresses (Halpern et al., 2015) will improve the resilience of 
marine ecosystems as they transition to a 1.5°C world (O’Leary et 
al., 2017).  Approaches to reducing local stresses are considered 
feasible, cost-effective and highly scalable. Ecosystem resilience 
may be increased through alternative livelihoods (e.g., sustainable 
aquaculture), which are among a suite of options for building resilience 
in coastal ecosystems. These options enjoy high levels of feasibility yet 
are expensive, which stands in the way of scalability (robust evidence, 
medium agreement) (Hiwasaki et al., 2015; Brugnach et al., 2017).  
Working with coastal communities has the potential for improving 
the resilience of coastal ecosystems. Combined with the advantages 
of using indigenous knowledge to guide transitions, solutions can be 
more effective when undertaken in partnership with local communities, 
cultures, and knowledge (See Box 4.3).
Restoration of coastal ecosystems and fisheries. Marine 
restoration is expensive compared to terrestrial restoration, and the 
survival of projects is currently low, with success depending on the 
ecosystem and site, rather than the size of the financial investment 
(Bayraktarov et al., 2016). Mangrove replanting shows evidence 
of success globally, with numerous examples of projects that have 
established forests (Kimball et al., 2015; Bayraktarov et al., 2016).
Efforts with reef-building corals have been attempted with a low level 
of success (Bayraktarov et al., 2016). Technologies to help re-establish 
coral communities are limited (Rinkevich, 2014), as are largely 
untested disruptive technologies (e.g., genetic manipulation, assisted 
evolution) (van Oppen et al., 2015). Current technologies also have 
trouble scaling given the substantial costs and investment required 
(Bayraktarov et al., 2016).
Johannessen and Macdonald (2016) report the ‘blue carbon’ sink to 
be 0.4–0.8% of global anthropogenic emissions. However, this does 
not adequately account for post-depositional processes and could 
overestimate removal potentials, subject to a risk of reversal. Seagrass 
beds will thus not contribute significantly to enabling 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways.
4.3.3 
Urban and Infrastructure System Transitions
There will be approximately 70 million additional urban residents every 
year through to the middle part of this century (UN DESA, 2014). The 
majority of these new urban citizens will reside in small and medium-
sized cities in low- and middle-income countries (Cross-Chapter Box 
13 in Chapter 5). The combination of urbanization and economic 
and infrastructure development could account for an additional 
226 GtCO2 by 2050 (Bai et al. 2018). However, urban systems can 
harness the mega-trends of urbanization, digitalization, financialization 
and growing sub-national commitment to smart cities, green cities, 
resilient cities, sustainable cities and adaptive cities, for the type of 
331
4
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
transformative change required by 1.5°C-consistent pathways (SDSN, 
2013; Parag and Sovacool, 2016; Roberts, 2016; Wachsmuth et al., 2016; 
Revi, 2017; Solecki et al., 2018). There is a growing number of urban 
climate responses driven by cost-effectiveness, development, work 
creation and inclusivity considerations (Solecki et al., 2013; Ahern et 
al., 2014; Floater et al., 2014; Revi et al., 2014a; Villarroel Walker et 
al., 2014; Kennedy et al., 2015; Rodríguez, 2015; McGranahan et al., 
2016; Dodman et al., 2017a; Newman et al., 2017; UN-Habitat, 2017; 
Westphal et al., 2017). 
In addition, low-carbon cities could reduce the need to deploy carbon 
dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation modification (SRM) (Fink, 
2013; Thomson and Newman, 2016).  
Cities are also places in which the risks associated with warming of 
1.5°C, such as heat stress, terrestrial and coastal flooding, new disease 
vectors, air pollution and water scarcity, will coalesce (see Chapter 3, 
Section 3.3) (Dodman et al., 2017a; Satterthwaite and Bartlett, 2017). 
Unless adaptation and mitigation efforts are designed around the need 
to decarbonize urban societies in the developed world and provide 
low-carbon solutions to the needs of growing urban populations in 
developing countries, they will struggle to deliver the pace or scale 
of change required by 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Hallegatte et al., 
2013; Villarroel Walker et al., 2014; Roberts, 2016; Solecki et al., 2018). 
The pace and scale of urban climate responses can be enhanced by 
attention to social equity (including gender equity), urban ecology 
(Brown and McGranahan, 2016; Wachsmuth et al., 2016; Ziervogel 
et al., 2016a) and participation in sub-national networks for climate 
action (Cole, 2015; Jordan et al., 2015). 
The long-lived urban transport, water and energy systems that will be 
constructed in the next three decades to support urban populations in 
developing countries and to retrofit cities in developed countries will 
have to be different to those built in Europe and North America in the 
20th century, if they are to support the required transitions (Freire et al., 
2014; Cartwright, 2015; McPhearson et al., 2016; Roberts, 2016; Lwasa, 
2017). Recent literature identifies energy, infrastructure, appliances, 
urban planning, transport and adaptation options as capable of 
facilitating systemic change. It is these aspects of the urban system that 
are discussed below and from which options in Section 4.5 are selected.
4.3.3.1 Urban energy systems
Urban economies tend to be more energy intensive than national 
economies due to higher levels of per capita income, mobility and 
consumption (Kennedy et al., 2015; Broto, 2017; Gota et al., 2018). 
However, some urban systems have begun decoupling development 
from the consumption of fossil fuel-powered energy through energy 
efficiency, renewable energy and locally managed smart grids 
(Dodman, 2009; Freire et al., 2014; Eyre et al., 2018; Glazebrook and 
Newman, 2018).
The rapidly expanding cities of Africa and Asia, where energy poverty 
currently undermines adaptive capacity (Westphal et al., 2017; 
Satterthwaite et al., 2018), have the opportunity to benefit from recent 
price changes in renewable energy technologies to enable clean 
energy access to citizens (SDG 7) (Cartwright, 2015; Watkins, 2015; 
Lwasa, 2017; Kennedy et al., 2018; Teferi and Newman, 2018). This will 
require strengthened energy governance in these countries (Eberhard 
et al., 2017). Where renewable energy displaces paraffin, wood fuel 
or charcoal feedstocks in informal urban settlements, it provides 
the co-benefits of improved indoor air quality, reduced fire risk and 
reduced deforestation, all of which can enhance adaptive capacity 
and strengthen demand for this energy (Newham and Conradie, 2013; 
Winkler, 2017; Kennedy et al., 2018; Teferi and Newman, 2018). 
4.3.3.2 Urban infrastructure, buildings and appliances
Buildings are responsible for 32% of global energy consumption (IEA, 
2016c) and have a large energy saving potential with available and 
demonstrated technologies such as energy efficiency improvements 
in technical installations and in thermal insulation (Toleikyte et al., 
2018) and energy sufficiency (Thomas et al., 2017). Kuramochi et 
al. (2018) show that 1.5°C-consistent pathways require building 
emissions to be reduced by 80–90% by 2050, new construction to 
be fossil-free and near-zero energy by 2020, and an increased rate of 
energy refurbishment of existing buildings to 5% per annum in OECD 
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries 
(see also Section 4.2.1).
Based on the IEA-ETP (IEA, 2017g), Chapter 2 identifies large saving 
potential in heating and cooling through improved building design, 
efficient equipment, lighting and appliances. Several examples of 
net zero energy in buildings are now available (Wells et al., 2018). 
In existing buildings, refurbishment enables energy saving (Semprini 
et al., 2017; Brambilla et al., 2018; D’Agostino and Parker, 2018; Sun 
et al., 2018) and cost savings (Toleikyte et al., 2018; Zangheri et al., 
2018).
Reducing the energy embodied in building materials provides further 
energy and GHG savings (Cabeza et al., 2013; Oliver and Morecroft, 
2014; Koezjakov et al., 2018), in particular through increased use of bio-
based materials (Lupíšek et al., 2015) and wood construction (Ramage 
et al., 2017). The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP3) 
estimates that improving embodied energy, thermal performance, and 
direct energy use of buildings can reduce emissions by 1.9 GtCO2e yr −1 
(UNEP, 2017b), with an additional reduction of 3 GtCO2e yr−1 through 
energy efficient appliances and lighting (UNEP, 2017b). Further 
increasing the energy efficiency of appliances and lighting, heating 
and cooling offers the potential for further savings (Parikh and Parikh, 
2016; Garg et al., 2017). 
Smart technology, drawing on the internet of things (IoT) and building 
information modelling, offers opportunities to accelerate energy 
efficiency in buildings and cities (Moreno-Cruz and Keith, 2013; Hoy, 
2016) (see also Section 4.4.4). Some cities in developing countries 
are drawing on these technologies to adopt ‘leapfrog’ infrastructure, 
buildings and appliances to pursue low-carbon development (Newman 
et al., 2017; Teferi and Newman, 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 13 in 
Chapter 5).

4.3.3.3 Urban transport and urban planning
Urban form impacts demand for energy (Sims et al., 2014) and other 
welfare related factors: a meta-analysis of 300 papers reported 
energy savings of 26 USD per person per year attributable to a 10% 
increase in urban population density (Ahlfeldt and Pietrostefani, 
2017). Significant reductions in car use are associated with dense, 
pedestrianized cities and towns and medium-density transit corridors 
(Newman and Kenworthy, 2015; Newman et al., 2017) relative to low-
density cities in which car dependency is high (Schiller and Kenworthy, 
2018). Combined dense urban forms and new mass transit systems 
in Shanghai and Beijing have yielded less car use (Gao and Newman, 
2018) (see Box 4.9). Compact cities also create the passenger density 
required to make public transport more financially viable (Rode et al., 
2017; Ahlfeldt and Pietrostefani, 2017) and enable combinations of 
cleaner fuel feedstocks and urban smart grids, in which vehicles form 
part of the storage capacity (Oldenbroek et al., 2017). Similarly, the 
spatial organization of urban energy influenced the trajectories of 
urban development in cities as diverse as Hong Kong, Bengaluru and 
Maputo (Broto, 2017). 
The informal settlements of middle- and low-income cities, where urban 
density is more typically associated with a range of water- and vector-
borne health risks, may provide a notable exception to the adaptive 
advantages of urban density (Mitlin and Satterthwaite, 2013; Lilford et 
al., 2017) unless new approaches and technologies are harnessed to 
accelerate slum upgrading (Teferi and Newman, 2017).
Scenarios consistent with 1.5°C depend on a roughly 15% reduction 
in final energy use by the transport sector by 2050 relative to 2015 
(Chapter 2, Figure 2.12). In one analysis the phasing out of fossil fuel 
passenger vehicle sales by 2035–2050 was identified as a benchmark 
for aligning with 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Kuramochi et al., 2018). 
Reducing emissions from transport has lagged the power sector (Sims 
et al., 2014; Creutzig et al., 2015a), but evidence since AR5 suggests 
that cities are urbanizing and re-urbanizing in ways that coordinate 
transport sector adaptation and mitigation (Colenbrander et al., 2017; 
Newman et al., 2017; Salvo et al., 2017; Gota et al., 2018). The global 
transport sector could reduce 4.7 GtCO2e yr−1 (4.1–5.3) by 2030. 
This is significantly more than is predicted by integrated assessment 
models (UNEP, 2017b). Such a transition depends on cities that 
enable modal shifts and avoided journeys and that provide incentives 
for uptake of improved fuel efficiency and changes in urban design 
that encourage walkable cities, non-motorized transport and shorter 
commuter distances (IEA, 2016a; Mittal et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 
2016; Li and Loo, 2017). In at least 4 African cities, 43 Asian cities 
and 54 Latin American cities, transit-oriented development (TOD), 
has emerged as an organizing principle for urban growth and spatial 
planning (Colenbrander et al., 2017; Lwasa, 2017; BRTData, 2018). 
This trend is important to counter the rising demand for private cars in 
developing-country cities (AfDB/OECD/UNDP, 2016). In India, TOD has 
been combined with localized solar PV installations and new ways of 
financing rail expansion (Sharma, 2018). 
Cities pursuing sustainable transport benefit from reduced air pollution, 
congestion and road fatalities and are able to harness the relationship 
between transport systems, urban form, urban energy intensity 
and social cohesion (Goodwin and Van Dender, 2013; Newman and 
Kenworthy, 2015; Wee, 2015). 
Technology and electrification trends since AR5 make carbon-efficient 
urban transport easier (Newman et al., 2016), but realizing urban 
transport’s contribution to a 1.5°C-consistent pathways will require 
the type of governance that can overcome the financial, institutional, 
behavioural and legal barriers to change (Geels, 2014; Bakker et al., 
2017). 
Adaptation to a 1.5°C world is enabled by urban design and spatial 
planning policies that consider extreme weather conditions and reduce 
displacement by climate related disasters (UNISDR, 2009; UN-Habitat, 
2011; Mitlin and Satterthwaite, 2013).
Building codes and technology standards for public lighting, 
including traffic lights (Beccali et al., 2015), play a critical role in 
reducing carbon emissions, enhancing urban climate resilience and 
managing climate risk (Steenhof and Sparling, 2011; Parnell, 2015; 
Shapiro, 2016; Evans et al., 2017). Building codes can support the 
convergence to zero emissions from buildings (Wells et al., 2018) and 
can be used retrofit the existing building stock for energy efficiency 
(Ruparathna et al., 2016). 
The application of building codes and standards for 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways will require improved enforcement, which can be a challenge 
in developing countries where inspection resources are often limited 
and codes are poorly tailored to local conditions (Ford et al., 2015c; 
Chandel et al., 2016; Eisenberg, 2016; Shapiro, 2016; Hess and Kelman, 
2017; Mavhura et al., 2017). In all countries, building codes can be 
undermined by industry interests and can be maladaptive if they 
prevent buildings or land use from evolving to reduce climate impacts 
(Eisenberg, 2016; Shapiro, 2016). 
The deficit in building codes and standards in middle-income 
and developing-country cities need not be a constraint to more 
energy-efficient and resilient buildings (Tait and Euston-Brown, 
2017). For example, the relatively high price that poor households 
pay for unreliable and at times dangerous household energy 
in African cities has driven the uptake of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency technologies in the absence of regulations or 
fiscal incentives (Eberhard et al., 2011, 2016; Cartwright, 2015; 
Watkins, 2015). The Kuyasa Housing Project in Khayelitsha, one of 
Cape Town’s poorest suburbs, created significant mitigation and 
adaptation benefits by installing ceilings, solar water heaters and 
energy-efficient lightbulbs in houses independent of the formal 
housing or electrification programme (Winkler, 2017).
4.3.3.4  Electrification of cities and transport
The electrification of urban systems, including transport, has shown 
global progress since AR5 (IEA, 2016a; Kennedy et al., 2018; Schiller 
and Kenworthy, 2018). High growth rates are now appearing in 
electric vehicles (Figure 4.1), electric bikes and electric transit (IEA, 
2018), which would need to displace fossil fuel-powered passenger 
vehicles by 2035–2050 to remain in line with 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways. China’s 2017 Road Map calls for 20% of new vehicle

sales to be electric. India is aiming for exclusively electric vehicles 
(EVs) by 2032 (NITI Aayog and RMI, 2017). Globally, EV sales were 
up 42% in 2016 relative to 2015, and in the United States EV sales 
were up 36% over the same period (Johnson and Walker, 2016). 
The extent of electric railways in and between cities has expanded 
since AR5 (IEA, 2016a; Mittal et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Li and 
Loo, 2017). In high-income cities there is medium evidence for the 
decoupling of car use and wealth since AR5 (Newman, 2017). In cities 
where private vehicle ownership is expected to increase, less carbon-
intensive fuel sources and reduced car journeys will be necessary as 
well as electrification of all modes of transport (Mittal et al., 2016; 
van Vuuren et al., 2017). Some recent urban data show a decoupling 
of urban growth and GHG emissions (Newman and Kenworthy, 2015) 
and that ‘peak car’ has been reached in Shanghai and Beijing (Gao and 
Kenworthy, 2017) and beyond (Manville et al., 2017) (also see Box 4.9).
An estimated 800 cities globally have operational bike-share schemes (E. 
Fishman et al., 2015), and China had 250 million electric bicycles in 2017 
(Newman et al., 2017). Advances in information and communication 
technologies (ICT) offer cities the chance to reduce urban transport 
congestion and fuel consumption by making better use of the urban 
vehicle fleet through car sharing, driverless cars and coordinated public 
transport, especially when electrified (Wee, 2015; Glazebrook and 
Newman, 2018). Advances in ‘big-data’ can assist in creating a better 
understanding of the connections between cities, green infrastructure, 
environmental services and health (Jennings et al., 2016) and improve 
decision-making in urban development (Lin et al., 2017).
4.3.3.5 Shipping, freight and aviation
International transport hubs, including airports and ports, and the 
associated mobility of people are major economic contributors to most 
large cities even while under the governance of national authorities 
and international legislation. Shipping, freight and aviation systems 
have grown rapidly, and little progress has been made since AR5 on 
replacing fossil fuels, though some trials are continuing (Zhang, 2016; 
Bouman et al., 2017; EEA, 2017). Aviation emissions do not yet feature 
in IAMs (Bows-Larkin, 2015), but could be reduced by between a third 
and two-thirds through energy efficiency measures and operational 
changes (Dahlmann et al., 2016). On shorter intercity trips, aviation 
could be replaced by high-speed electric trains drawing on renewable 
energy (Åkerman, 2011). Some progress has been made on the use 
of electricity in planes and shipping (Grewe et al., 2017) though no 
commercial applications have arisen. Studies indicate that biofuels are 
the most viable means of decarbonizing intercontinental travel, given 
their technical characteristics, energy content and affordability (Wise 
et al., 2017). The lifecycle emissions of bio-based jet fuels and marine 
fuels can be considerable (Cox et al., 2014; IEA, 2017g) depending on 
their location (Elshout et al., 2014), but can be reduced by feedstock 
and conversion technology choices (de Jong et al., 2017). 
In recent years the potential for transport to use synfuels, such as 
ethanol, methanol, methane, ammonia and hydrogen, created from 
renewable electricity and CO2, has gained momentum but has not yet 
demonstrated benefits on a scale consistent with 1.5°C pathways (Ezeji, 
2017; Fasihi et al., 2017). Decarbonizing the fuel used by the world’s 
60,000 large ocean vessels faces governance barriers and the need for 
a global policy (Bows and Smith, 2012; IRENA, 2015; Rehmatulla and 
Smith, 2015). Low-emission marine fuels could simultaneously address 
sulphur and black carbon issues in ports and around waterways and 
accelerate the electrification of all large ports (Bouman et al., 2017; 
IEA, 2017g). 
4.3.3.6 Climate-resilient land use 
Urban land use influences energy intensity, risk exposure and adaptive 
capacity (Carter et al., 2015; Araos et al., 2016a; Ewing et al., 2016; 
Newman et al., 2016; Broto, 2017). Accordingly, urban land-use 
planning can contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation (Parnell, 
2015; Francesch-Huidobro et al., 2017) and the growing number of 
urban climate adaptation plans provide instruments to do this (Carter 
et al., 2015; Dhar and Khirfan, 2017; Siders, 2017; Stults and Woodruff, 
2017). Adaptation plans can reduce exposure to urban flood risk 
(which, in a 1.5°C world, could double relative to 1976–2005; Alfieri 
et al., 2017), heat stress (Chapter 3, Section 3.5.5.8), fire risk (Chapter 
3, Section 3.4.3.4) and sea level rise (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.5.1) 
(Schleussner et al., 2016).   
Cities can reduce their risk exposure by considering investment in 
infrastructure and buildings that are more resilient to warming of 
1.5°C or beyond. Where adaptation planning and urban planning 
generate the type of local participation that enhances capacity to cope 
with risks, they can be mutually supportive processes  (Archer et al., 
2014; Kettle et al., 2014; Campos et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2017; Siders, 
2017; Underwood et al., 2017). Not all adaptation plans are reported 
as effective (Measham et al., 2011; Hetz, 2016; Woodruff and Stults, 
2016; Mahlkow and Donner, 2017), especially in developing-country 
cities (Kiunsi, 2013). In cases where adaptation planning may further 
marginalize poor citizens, either through limited local control over 
adaptation priorities or by displacing impacts onto poorer communities, 
successful urban risk management would need to consider factors 
such as justice, equity, and inclusive participation, as well as recognize 
the political economy of adaptation (Archer, 2016; Shi et al., 2016; 
Ziervogel et al., 2016a, 2017; Chu et al., 2017).

4.3.3.7 Green urban infrastructure and ecosystem services
Integrating and promoting green urban infrastructure (including 
street trees, parks, green roofs and facades, and water features) into 
city planning can be difficult (Leck et al., 2015) but increases urban 
resilience to impacts of 1.5°C warming (Table 4.2) in ways that can be 
more cost-effective than conventional infrastructure (Cartwright et al., 
2013; Culwick and Bobbins, 2016).
Realizing climate benefits from urban green infrastructure sometimes 
requires a city-region perspective (Wachsmuth et al., 2016). Where 
the urban impact on ecological systems in and beyond the city is 
appreciated, the potential for transformative change exists (Soderlund 
and Newman, 2015; Ziervogel et al., 2016a), and a locally appropriate 
combination of green space, ecosystem goods and services and the 
built environment can increase the set of urban adaptation options 
(Puppim de Oliveira et al., 2013). 
Milan, Italy, a city with deliberate urban greening policies, planted 
10,000 hectares of new forest and green areas over the last two 
decades (Sanesi et al., 2017). The accelerated growth of urban trees, 
relative to rural trees, in several regions of the world is expected to 
decrease tree longevity (Pretzsch et al., 2017), requiring monitoring 
and additional management of urban trees if their contribution to 
urban ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation is to be maintained 
in a 1.5°C world (Buckeridge, 2015; Pretzsch et al., 2017). 
4.3.3.8 Sustainable urban water and environmental services
Urban water supply and wastewater treatment is energy intensive and 
currently accounts for significant GHG emissions (Nair et al., 2014). 
Cities can integrate sustainable water resource management and the 
supply of water services in ways that support mitigation, adaptation 
and development through waste water recycling and storm water 
diversion (Xue et al., 2015; Poff et al., 2016). Governance and finance 
challenges complicate balancing sustainable water supply and rising 
urban demand, particularly in low-income cities (Bettini et al., 2015; 
Deng and Zhao, 2015; Hill Clarvis and Engle, 2015; Lemos, 2015; 
Margerum and Robinson, 2015). 
Urban surface-sealing with impervious materials affects the volume 
and velocity of runoff and flooding during intense rainfall (Skougaard 
Kaspersen et al., 2015), but urban design in many cities now seeks 
to mediate runoff, encourage groundwater recharge and enhance 
water quality (Liu et al., 2014; Lamond et al., 2015; Voskamp and 
Van de Ven, 2015; Costa et al., 2016; Mguni et al., 2016; Xie et al., 
2017). Challenges remain for managing intense rainfall events that are 
reported to be increasing in frequency and intensity in some locations 
(Ziervogel et al., 2016b), and urban flooding is expected to increase at 
1.5°C of warming (Alfieri et al., 2017). This risk falls disproportionately 
on women and poor people in cities (Mitlin, 2005; Chu et al., 2016; 
Ziervogel et al., 2016b; Chant et al., 2017; Dodman et al., 2017a, b).
Nexus approaches that highlight urban areas as socio-ecological 
systems can support policy coherence (Rasul and Sharma, 2016) and 
sustainable urban livelihoods (Biggs et al., 2015). The water–energy–
food (WEF) nexus is especially important to growing urban populations 
(Tacoli et al., 2013; Lwasa et al., 2014; Villarroel Walker et al., 2014).

4.3.4 
Industrial Systems Transitions
Industry consumes about one-third of global final energy and contributes, 
directly and indirectly, about one-third of global GHG emissions (IPCC, 
2014b). If the increase in global mean temperature is to remain under 
1.5°C, modelling indicates that industry cannot emit more than 2 
GtCO2 in 2050, corresponding to a reduction of between 67 and 91% 
(interquartile range) in GHG emissions compared to 2010 (see Chapter 
2, Figures 2.20 and 2.21, and Table 4.1). Moreover, the consequences 
of warming of 1.5°C or more pose substantial challenges for industrial 
diversity. This section will first briefly discuss the limited literature on 
adaptation options for industry. Subsequently, new literature since AR5 
on the feasibility of industrial mitigation options will be discussed. 
Research assessing adaptation actions by industry indicates that only 
a small fraction of corporations has developed adaptation measures. 
Studies of adaptation in the private sector remain limited (Agrawala et 
al., 2011; Linnenluecke et al., 2015; Averchenkova et al., 2016; Bremer 
and Linnenluecke, 2016; Pauw et al., 2016a) and for 1.5°C are largely 
335

Chapter 4
absent. This knowledge gap is particularly evident for medium-sized 
enterprises and in low- and middle-income nations (Surminski, 2013). 
Depending on the industrial sector, mitigation consistent with 1.5°C 
would mean, across industries, a reduction of final energy demand 
by one-third, an increase of the rate of recycling of materials and the 
development of a circular economy in industry (Lewandowski, 2016; 
Linder and Williander, 2017), the substitution of materials in high-
carbon products with those made up of renewable materials (e.g., wood 
instead of steel or cement in the construction sector, natural textile 
fibres instead of plastics), and a range of deep emission reduction 
options, including use of bio-based feedstocks, low-emission heat 
sources, electrification of production processes, and/or capture and 
storage of all CO2 emissions by 2050 (Åhman et al., 2016). Some of the 
choices for mitigation options and routes for GHG-intensive industry 
are discrete and potentially subject to path dependency: if an industry 
goes one way (e.g., in keeping existing processes), it will be harder to 
transition to process change (e.g., electrification) (Bataille et al., 2018). 
In the context of rising demand for construction, an increasing share 
of industrial production may be based in developing countries (N. Li et 
al., 2017), where current efficiencies may be lower than in developed 
countries, and technical and institutional feasibility may differ (Ma et 
al., 2015). 
Except for energy efficiency, costs of disruptive change associated 
with hydrogen- or electricity-based production, bio-based feedstocks 
and carbon dioxide capture, (utilization) and storage (CC(U)S) for 
trade-sensitive industrial sectors (in particular the iron and steel, 
petrochemical and refining industries) make policy action by individual 
countries challenging because of competitiveness concerns (Åhman et 
al., 2016; Nabernegg et al., 2017).

industrial sectors.

Table 4.3  | Overview of different mitigation options potentially consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and applicable to main industrial sectors, including examples of  
 
application (Napp et al., 2014; Boulamanti and Moya, 2017; Wesseling et al., 2017).
4.3.4.1 Energy efficiency
Isolated efficiency implementation in energy-intensive industries is a 
necessary but insufficient condition for deep emission reductions (Napp 
et al., 2014; Aden, 2018). Various options specific to different industries 
are available. In general, their feasibility depends on lowering capital 
costs and raising awareness and expertise (Wesseling et al., 2017). 
General-purpose technologies, such as ICT, and energy management 
tools can improve the prospects of energy efficiency in industry (see 
Section 4.4.4).
Cross-sector technologies and practices, which play a role in all 
industrial sectors including small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) 
and non-energy intensive industry, also offer potential for considerable 
energy efficiency improvements. They include: (i) motor systems (for 
example electric motors, variable speed drives, pumps, compressors 
and fans), responsible for about 10% of worldwide industrial energy 
consumption, with a global energy efficiency improvement potential of 
around 20–25% (Napp et al., 2014); and (ii) steam systems, responsible 
for about 30% of industrial energy consumption and energy saving 
potentials of about 10% (Hasanbeigi et al., 2014; Napp et al., 2014). 
Waste heat recovery from industry has substantial potential for energy 
efficiency and emission reduction (Forman et al., 2016). Low awareness 
and competition from other investments limit the feasibility of such 
options (Napp et al., 2014). 
4.3.4.2 Substitution and circularity
Recycling materials and developing a circular economy can be 
institutionally challenging, as it requires advanced capabilities (Henry et 
al., 2006) and organizational changes (Cooper-Searle et al., 2018), but 
has advantages in terms of cost, health, governance and environment 
(Ali et al., 2017). An assessment of the impacts on energy use and 
environmental issues is not available, but substitution could play a large 
role in reducing emissions (Åhman et al., 2016) although its potential 
depends on the demand for material and the turnover rate of, for 
example, buildings (Haas et al., 2015). Material substitution and CO2 
storage options are under development, for example, the use of algae 
and renewable energy for carbon fibre production, which could become 
a net sink of CO2 (Arnold et al., 2018).
4.3.4.3 Bio-based feedstocks
Bio-based feedstock processes could be seen as part of the circular 
materials economy (see section above). In several sectors, bio-based 
336
Chapter 4 
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response

feedstocks would leave the production process of materials relatively 
untouched, and a switch would not affect the product quality, 
making the option more attractive. However, energy requirements 
for processing bio-based feedstocks are often high, costs are also 
still higher, and the emissions over the full life cycle, both upstream 
and downstream, could be significant (Wesseling et al., 2017). Bio-
based feedstocks may put pressure on natural resources by increasing 
land demand by biodiversity impacts beyond bioenergy demand for 
electricity, transport and buildings (Slade et al., 2014), and, partly as a 
result, face barriers in public acceptance (Sleenhoff et al., 2015). 
4.3.4.4 Electrification and hydrogen
Electrification of manufacturing processes would constitute a 
significant technological challenge and would entail a more disruptive 
innovation in industry than bio-based or CCS options to get to very low 
or zero emissions, except potentially in steel-making (Philibert, 2017). 
The disruptive characteristics could potentially lead to stranded assets, 
and could reduce political feasibility and industry support (Åhman 
et al., 2016). Electrification of manufacturing would require further 
technological development in industry, as well as an ample supply of 
cost-effective low-emission electricity (Philibert, 2017). 
Low-emission hydrogen can be produced by natural gas with CCS, 
by electrolysis of water powered by zero-emission electricity, or 
potentially in the future by generation IV nuclear reactors. Feasibility of 
electrification and use of hydrogen in production processes or fuel cells 
is affected by technical development (in terms of efficient hydrogen 
production and electrification of processes), by geophysical factors 
related to the availability of low-emission electricity (MacKay, 2013), 
by associated public perception and by economic feasibility, except 
in areas with ample solar and/or wind resources (Philibert, 2017; 
Wesseling et al., 2017). 
4.3.4.5 CO2 capture, utilization and storage in industry
CO2 capture in industry is generally considered more feasible than CCS 
in the power sector (Section 4.3.1) or from bioenergy sources (Section 
4.3.7), although CCS in industry faces similar barriers. Almost all of 
the current full-scale (>1MtCO2 yr−1) CCS projects capture CO2 from 
industrial sources, including the Sleipner project in Norway, which has 
been injecting CO2 from a gas facility in an offshore saline formation 
since 1996 (Global CCS Institute, 2017). Compared to the power 
sector, retrofitting CCS on existing industrial plants would leave the 
production process of materials relatively untouched (Åhman et al., 
2016), though significant investments and modifications still have to 
be made. Some industries, in particular cement, emit CO2 as inherent 
process emissions and can therefore not reduce emissions to zero 
without CC(U)S. CO2 stacks in some industries have a high economic 
and technical feasibility for CO2 capture as the CO2 concentration in 
the exhaust gases is relatively high (IPCC, 2005b; Leeson et al., 2017), 
but others require strong modifications in the production process, 
limiting technical and economic feasibility, though costs remain 
lower than other deep GHG reduction options (Rubin et al., 2015). 
There are indications that the energy use in CO2 capture through 
amine solvents (for solvent regeneration) can decrease by around 
60%, from 5 GJ tCO2
−1 in 2005 to 2 GJ tCO2
−1 in the best-performing 
current pilot plants (Idem et al., 2015), increasing both technical and 
economic potential for this option. The heterogeneity of industrial 
production processes might point to the need for specific institutional 
arrangements to incentivize industrial CCS (Mikunda et al., 2014), and 
may decrease institutional feasibility.
Whether carbon dioxide utilization (CCU) can contribute to limiting 
warming to 1.5°C depends on the origin of the CO2 (fossil, biogenic 
or atmospheric), the source of electricity for converting the CO2 
or regenerating catalysts, and the lifetime of the product. Review 
studies indicate that CO2 utilization in industry has a small role to 
play in limiting warming to 1.5°C because of the limited potential of 
reusing CO2 with currently available technologies and the re-emission 
of CO2 when used as a fuel (IPCC, 2005b; Mac Dowell et al., 2017). 
However, new developments could make CCU more feasible, in 
particular in CO2 use as a feedstock for carbon-based materials that 
would isolate CO2 from the atmosphere for a long time, and in low-
cost, low-emission electricity that would make the energy use of CO2 
capture more sustainable. The conversion of CO2 to fuels using zero-
emission electricity has a lower technical, economic and environmental 
feasibility than direct CO2 capture and storage from industry (Abanades 
et al., 2017), although the economic prospects have improved recently 
(Philibert, 2017).  
4.3.5 
Overarching Adaptation Options Supporting 
Adaptation Transitions 
This section assesses overarching adaptation options –specific solutions 
from which actors can choose and make decisions to reduce climate 
vulnerability and build resilience. We examine their feasibility in 
the context of transitions of energy, land and ecosystem, urban and 
infrastructure, and industrial systems here, and further in Section 4.5. 
These options can contribute to creating an enabling environment for 
adaptation (see Table 4.4 and Section 4.4). 
4.3.5.1 Disaster risk management (DRM)
DRM is a process for designing, implementing and evaluating strategies, 
policies and measures to improve the understanding of disaster risk, 
and promoting improvement in disaster preparedness, response and 
recovery (IPCC, 2012). There is increased demand to integrate DRM and 
adaptation (Howes et al., 2015; Kelman et al., 2015; Serrao-Neumann 
et al., 2015; Archer, 2016; Rose, 2016; van der Keur et al., 2016; Kelman, 
2017; Wallace, 2017) to reduce vulnerability, but institutional, technical 
and financial capacity challenges in frontline agencies constitute 
constraints (medium evidence, high agreement) (Eakin et al., 2015; Kita, 
2017; Wallace, 2017).
4.3.5.2 Risk sharing and spreading
Risks associated with 1.5°C warming (Chapter 3, Section 3.4) may 
increase the demand for options that share and spread financial 
burdens. Formal, market-based (re)insurance spreads risk and 
provides a financial buffer against the impacts of climate hazards 
(Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler, 2015; Wolfrom and Yokoi-
Arai, 2015; O’Hare et al., 2016; Glaas et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2017). 
As an alternative to traditional indemnity-based insurance, index-

Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
based micro-crop and livestock insurance programmes have been 
rolled out in regions with less developed insurance markets (Akter et 
al., 2016, 2017; Jensen and Barrett, 2017). There is medium evidence 
and medium agreement on the feasibility of insurance for adaptation, 
with financial, social, and institutional barriers to implementation and 
uptake, especially in low-income nations (García Romero and Molina, 
2015; Joyette et al., 2015; Lashley and Warner, 2015; Jin et al., 2016). 
Social protection programmes include cash and in-kind transfers to 
protect poor and vulnerable households from the impact of economic 
shocks, natural disasters and other crises (World Bank, 2017b), and 
can build generic adaptive capacity and reduce vulnerability when 
combined with a comprehensive climate risk management approach 
(medium evidence, medium agreement) (Devereux, 2016; Lemos et al., 
2016).
4.3.5.3 Education and learning
Educational adaptation options motivate adaptation through building 
awareness (Butler et al., 2016; Myers et al., 2017), leveraging multiple 
knowledge systems (Pearce et al., 2015; Janif et al., 2016), developing 
participatory action research and social learning processes (Butler and 
Adamowski, 2015; Ensor and Harvey, 2015; Butler et al., 2016; Thi 
Hong Phuong et al., 2017; Ford et al., 2018), strengthening extension 
services, and building mechanisms for learning and knowledge sharing 
through community-based platforms, international conferences and 
knowledge networks (Vinke-de Kruijf and Pahl-Wostl, 2016) (medium 
evidence, high agreement).
4.3.5.4 Population health and health system adaptation options
Climate change will exacerbate existing health challenges (Chapter 3, 
Section 3.4.7). Options for enhancing current health services include 
providing access to safe water and improved sanitation, enhancing 
access to essential services such as vaccination, and developing or 
strengthening integrated surveillance systems (WHO, 2015). Combining 
these with iterative management can facilitate effective adaptation 
(medium evidence, high agreement).
4.3.5.5 Indigenous knowledge 
There is medium evidence and high agreement that indigenous 
knowledge is critical for adaptation, underpinning adaptive capacity 
through the diversity of indigenous agro-ecological and forest 
management systems, collective social memory, repository of 
accumulated experience and social networks (Hiwasaki et al., 2015; 
Pearce et al., 2015; Mapfumo et al., 2016; Sherman et al., 2016; Ingty, 
2017) (Box 4.3). Indigenous knowledge is threatened by acculturation, 
dispossession of land rights and land grabbing, rapid environmental 
changes, colonization and social change, resulting in increasing 
vulnerability to climate change – which climate policy can exacerbate 
if based on limited understanding of indigenous worldviews (Thornton 
and Manasfi, 2010; Ford, 2012; Nakashima et al., 2012; McNamara 
and Prasad, 2014). Many scholars argue that recognition of indigenous 
rights, governance systems and laws is central to adaptation, mitigation 
and sustainable development (Magni, 2017; Thornton and Comberti, 
2017; Pearce, 2018).
4.3.5.6 Human migration
Human migration, whether planned, forced or voluntary, is increasingly 
gaining attention as a response, particularly where climatic risks are 
becoming severe (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.10.2). There is medium 
evidence and low agreement as to whether migration is adaptive, 
in relation to cost effectiveness concerns (Grecequet et al., 2017) 
and scalability (Brzoska and Fröhlich, 2016; Gemenne and Blocher, 
2017; Grecequet et al., 2017). Migrating can have mixed outcomes 
on reducing socio-economic vulnerability (Birk and Rasmussen, 
2014; Kothari, 2014; Adger et al., 2015; Betzold, 2015; Kelman, 2015; 
Grecequet et al., 2017; Melde et al., 2017; World Bank, 2017a; Kumari 
Rigaud et al., 2018) and its feasibility is constrained by low political 
and legal acceptability and inadequate institutional capacity (Betzold, 
2015; Methmann and Oels, 2015; Brzoska and Fröhlich, 2016; Gemenne 
and Blocher, 2017; Grecequet et al., 2017; Yamamoto et al., 2017).  
4.3.5.7 Climate services 
There is medium evidence and high agreement that climate services 
can play a critical role in aiding adaptation decision-making (Vaughan 
and Dessai, 2014; Wood et al., 2014; Lourenço et al., 2016; Trenberth et 
al., 2016; Singh et al., 2017; Vaughan et al., 2018). The higher uptake 
of short-term climate information such as weather advisories and 
daily forecasts contrast with lesser use of longer-term information 
such as seasonal forecasts and multi-decadal projections (Singh et al., 
2017; Vaughan et al., 2018). Climate service interventions have met 
challenges with scaling up due to low capacity, inadequate institutions, 
and difficulties in maintaining systems beyond pilot project stage 
(Sivakumar et al., 2014; Tall et al., 2014; Gebru et al., 2015; Singh et 
al., 2016b), and technical, institutional, design, financial and capacity 
barriers to the application of climate information for better decision-
making remain (Briley et al., 2015; WMO, 2015; L. Jones et al., 2016; 
Lourenço et al., 2016; Snow et al., 2016; Harjanne, 2017; Singh et al., 
2017; C.J. White et al., 2017).

Examples
Disaster risk 
management 
(DRM)
Governance and institutional capacity:  supports post-disaster 
recovery and reconstruction (Kelman et al., 2015; Kull et al., 2016).
Early warning systems (Anacona et al., 2015), and monitoring of dangerous lakes and  
surrounding slopes (including using remote sensing) offer DRM opportunities  
(Emmer et al., 2016; Milner et al., 2017).
Risk sharing 
and spreading: 
insurance 
Institutional capacity and finance:  buffers climate risk 
(Wolfrom and Yokoi-Arai, 2015; O’Hare et al., 2016; Glaas 
et al., 2017; Jenkins et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2017).
In 2007, the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility was formed to pool risk from 
tropical cyclones, earthquakes, and excess rainfalls (Murphy et al., 2012; CCRIF, 2017).
Social safety nets
Institutional capacity and finance: builds generic adaptive capacity 
and reduces social vulnerability (Weldegebriel and Prowse, 2013; 
Eakin et al., 2014; Lemos et al., 2016; Schwan and Yu, 2017).
In sub-Saharan Africa, cash transfer programmes targeting poor communities have proven  
successful in smoothing household welfare and food security during droughts, strengthening  
community ties, and reducing debt levels (del Ninno et al., 2016; Asfaw et al., 2017;  
Asfaw and Davis, 2018).
Education and 
learning
Behavioural change and institutional capacity: social learning 
strengthens adaptation and affects longer-term change (Clemens 
et al., 2015; Ensor and Harvey, 2015; Henly-Shepard et al., 2015).
Participatory scenario planning is a process by which multiple stakeholders work together 
to envision future scenarios under a range of climatic conditions (Oteros-Rozas et al.,  
2015; Butler et al., 2016; Flynn et al., 2018).
Population health 
and health system
Institutional capacity: 1.5°C warming will primarily exacerbate  
existing health challenges (K.R. Smith et al., 2014), which can  
be targeted by enhancing health services. 
Heatwave early warning and response systems coordinate the implementation of multiple 
measures in response to predicted extreme temperatures (e.g., public announcements, 
opening public cooling shelters, distributing information on heat stress symptoms) 
(Knowlton et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2015; Nitschke et al., 2016, 2017).
Indigenous 
knowledge 
Institutional capacity and behavioural change: knowledge of 
environmental conditions helps communities detect and monitor  
change (Johnson et al., 2015; Mistry and Berardi, 2016;  
Williams et al., 2017).
Options such as integration of indigenous knowledge into resource management systems  
and school curricula, are identified as potential adaptations (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013;  
McNamara and Prasad, 2014; MacDonald et al., 2015; Pearce et al., 2015; Chambers  
et al., 2017; Inamara and Thomas, 2017). 
Human migration
Governance: revising and adopting migration issues in national 
disaster risk management policies, National Adaptation Plans 
and NDCs (Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; Yamamoto et al., 2017).
In dryland India, populations in rural regions already experiencing 1.5°C warming are  
migrating to cities (Gajjar et al., 2018) but are inadequately covered by existing  
policies (Bhagat, 2017).
Climate services
Technological innovation: rapid technical development (due to 
increased financial inputs and growing demand) is improving  
quality of climate information provided (Rogers and Tsirkunov,  
2010; Clements et al., 2013; Perrels et al., 2013; Gasc et al., 2014;  
WMO, 2015; Roudier et al., 2016).
Climate services are seeing wide application in sectors such as agriculture, health, 
disaster management and insurance (Lourenço et al., 2016; Vaughan et al., 2018), 
with implications for adaptation decision-making (Singh et al., 2017).

This box presents four case studies from different social-ecological systems as examples of risks of 1.5°C warming and higher 
(Chapter 3); adaptation options that respond to these risks (Chapter 4); and their implications for poverty, livelihoods and 
sustainability (Chapter 5). It is not yet possible to generalize adaptation effectiveness across regions due to a lack of empirical 
studies and monitoring and evaluation of current efforts. 
Arctic 
The Arctic is undergoing the most rapid climate change globally (Larsen et al., 2014), warming by 1.9°C  over the last 30 years 
(Walsh, 2014; Grosse et al., 2016). For 2°C of global warming relative to pre-industrial levels, chances of an ice-free Arctic during 
summer are substantially higher than at 1.5°C (see Chapter 3, Sections 3.3.5 and 3.3.8), with permafrost melt, increased instances 
of storm surge, and extreme weather events anticipated along with later ice freeze up, earlier break up, and a longer ice-free open 
water season (Bring et al., 2016; DeBeer et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Chadburn et al., 2017; Melvin et al., 2017). Negative impacts 
on health, infrastructure, and economic sectors (AMAP, 2017a, b, 2018) are projected, although the extension of the summer ocean-
shipping season has potential economic opportunities (Ford et al., 2015b; Dawson et al., 2016; Ng et al., 2018).

Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
Communities, many with indigenous roots, have adapted to environmental change, developing or shifting harvesting activities and 
patterns of travel and transitioning economic systems (Forbes et al., 2009; Wenzel, 2009; Ford et al., 2015b; Pearce et al., 2015), 
although emotional and psychological effects have been documented (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2012; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018). Besides 
climate change (Keskitalo et al., 2011; Loring et al., 2016), economic and social conditions can constrain the capacity to adapt unless 
resources and cooperation are available from public and private sector actors (AMAP, 2017a, 2018) (see Chapter 5, Box 5.3). In 
Alaska, the cumulative economic impacts of climate change on public infrastructure are projected at 4.2 billion USD to 5.5 billion 
USD from 2015 to 2099, with adaptation efforts halving these estimates (Melvin et al., 2017). Marginalization, colonization, and 
land dispossession provide broader underlying challenges facing many communities across the circumpolar north in adapting to 
change (Ford et al., 2015a; Sejersen, 2015) (see Section 4.3.5). 
Adaptation opportunities include alterations to building codes and infrastructure design, disaster risk management, and surveillance 
(Ford et al., 2014a; AMAP, 2017a, b; Labbé et al., 2017). Most adaptation initiatives are currently occurring at local levels in response 
to both observed and projected environmental changes as well as social and economic stresses (Ford et al., 2015a). In a recent study 
of Canada, most adaptations were found to be in the planning stages (Labbé et al., 2017). Studies have suggested that a number of 
the adaptation actions are not sustainable, lack evaluation frameworks, and hold potential for maladaptation (Loboda, 2014; Ford et 
al., 2015a; Larsson et al., 2016). Utilizing indigenous and local knowledge and stakeholder engagement can aid the development of 
adaptation policies and broader sustainable development, along with more proactive and regionally coherent adaptation plans and 
actions, and regional cooperation (e.g., through the Arctic Council) (Larsson et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017a; Melvin et al., 2017; Forbis Jr 
and Hayhoe, 2018) (see Section 4.3.5). 
Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Territories
Extreme weather, linked to tropical storms and hurricanes, represent one of the largest risks facing Caribbean island nations 
(Chapter 3, Section 3.4.5.3). Non-economic damages include detrimental health impacts, forced displacement and destruction of 
cultural heritages. Projections of increased frequency of the most intense storms at 1.5°C and higher warming levels (Wehner et 
al., 2018; Chapter 3, Section 3.3.6; Box 3.5) are a significant cause for concern, making adaptation a matter of survival (Mycoo and 
Donovan, 2017).  
Despite a shared vulnerability arising from commonalities in location, circumstance and size (Bishop and Payne, 2012; Nurse et al., 
2014), adaptation approaches are nuanced by differences in climate governance, affecting vulnerability and adaptive capacity (see 
Section 4.4.1). Three cases exemplify differences in disaster risk management.
Cuba: Together with a robust physical infrastructure and human-resource base (Kirk, 2017), Cuba has implemented an effective 
civil defence system for emergency preparedness and disaster response, centred around community mobilization and preparedness 
(Kirk, 2017). Legislation to manage disasters, an efficient and robust early warning system, emergency stockpiles, adequate shelter 
system and continuous training and education of the population help create a ‘culture of risk’ (Isayama and Ono, 2015; Lizarralde 
et al., 2015) which reduces vulnerability to extreme events (Pichler and Striessnig, 2013). Cuba’s infrastructure is still susceptible to 
devastation, as seen in the aftermath of the 2017 hurricane season.
United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOT): All UKOT have developed National Disaster Preparedness Plans (PAHO/WHO, 
2016) and are part of the Caribbean Disaster Risk Management Program which aims to improve disaster risk management 
within the health sector. Different vulnerability levels across the UKOT (Lam et al., 2015) indicate the benefits of greater regional 
cooperation and capacity-building, not only within UKOT, but throughout the Caribbean (Forster et al., 2011). While sovereign states 
in the region can directly access climate funds and international support, Dependent Territories are reliant on their controlling 
states (Bishop and Payne, 2012). There tends to be low-scale management for environmental issues in UKOT, which increases 
UKOT’s vulnerability. Institutional limitations, lack of human and financial resources, and limited long-term planning are identified 
as barriers to adaptation (Forster et al., 2011).
Jamaica: Disaster management is coordinated through a hierarchy of national, parish and community disaster committees under the 
leadership of the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management (ODPEM). ODPEM coordinates disaster preparedness 
and risk-reduction efforts among key state and non-state agencies (Grove, 2013). A National Disaster Committee provides technical 
and policy oversight to the ODPEM and is composed of representatives from multiple stakeholders (Osei, 2007). Most initiatives 
are primarily funded through a mix of multilateral and bilateral loan and grant funding focusing on strengthening technical and 
institutional capacities of state- and research-based institutions and supporting integration of climate change considerations into 
national and sectoral development plans (Robinson, 2017).

To improve climate change governance in the region, Pittman et al. (2015) suggest incorporating holistic and integrated management 
systems, improving flexibility in collaborative processes, implementing monitoring programs, and increasing the capacity of local 
authorities. Implementation of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can 
contribute to addressing the risks related with extreme events (Chapter 5, Box 5.3).   
The Amazon
Terrestrial forests, such as the Amazon, are sensitive to changes in the climate, particularly drought (Laurance and Williamson, 2001) 
which might intensify through the 21st century (Marengo and Espinoza, 2016) (Chapter 3, Section 3.5.5.6). 
The poorest communities in the region face substantial risks with climate change, and barriers and limits to adaptive capacity (Maru 
et al., 2014; Pinho et al., 2014, 2015; Brondízio et al., 2016). The Amazon is considered a hotspot, with interconnections between 
increasing temperature, decreased precipitation and hydrological flow (Betts et al., 2018) (Sections 3.3.2.2, 3.3.3.2 and 3.3.5); low 
levels of socio-economic development (Pinho et al., 2014); and high levels of climate vulnerability (Darela et al., 2016). Limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C could increase food and water security in the region compared to 2°C (Betts et al., 2018), reduce the impact 
on poor people and sustainable development, and make adaptation easier (O’Neill et al., 2017), particularly in the Amazon (Bathiany 
et al., 2018) (Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2).
Climate policy in many Amazonian nations has focused on forests as carbon sinks (Soares-Filho et al., 2010). In 2009, the Brazilian 
National Policy on Climate Change acknowledged adaptation as a concern, and the government sought to mainstream adaptation 
into public administration. Brazil’s National Adaptation Plan sets guidelines for sectoral adaptation measures, primarily by developing 
capacity building, plans, assessments and tools to support adaptive decision-making. Adaptation is increasingly being presented 
as having mitigation co-benefits in the Brazilian Amazon (Gregorio et al., 2016), especially within ecosystem-based adaptation 
(Locatelli et al., 2011). In Peru’s Framework Law for Climate Change, every governmental sector will consider climatic conditions as 
potential risks and/or opportunities to promote economic development and to plan adaptation.
Drought and flood policies have had limited effectiveness in reducing vulnerability (Marengo et al., 2013). In the absence of effective 
adaptation, achieving the SDGs will be challenging, mainly in poverty, health, water and sanitation, inequality and gender equality 
(Chapter 5, Section 5.2.3). 
Urban systems
Around 360 million people reside in urban coastal areas where precipitation variability is exposing inadequacies of urban infrastructure 
and governance, with the poor being especially vulnerable (Reckien et al., 2017) (Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 5). Urban systems 
have seen growing adaptation action (Revi et al., 2014b; Araos et al., 2016b; Amundsen et al., 2018). Developing cities spend more 
on health and agriculture-related adaptation options while developed cities spend more on energy and water (Georgeson et al., 
2016). Current adaptation activities are lagging in emerging economies, which are major centres of population growth facing complex 
interrelated pressures on investment in health, housing and education (Georgeson et al., 2016; Reckien et al., 2017). 
New York, United States: Adaptation plans are undertaken across government levels, sectors and departments (NYC Parks, 2010; 
Vision 2020 Project Team, 2011; PlaNYC, 2013), and have been advanced by an expert science panel that is obligated by local city 
law to provide regular updates on policy-relevant climate science (NPCC, 2015). Federal initiatives include 2013’s Rebuild By Design 
competition to promote resilience through infrastructural projects (HSRTF, 2013). In 2013 the Mayor’s office, in response to Hurricane 
Sandy, published the city’s adaptation strategy (PlaNYC, 2013). In 2015, the OneNYC Plan for a Strong and Just City (OneNYC Team, 
2015) laid out a strategy for urban planning through a justice and equity lens. In 2017, new climate resiliency guidelines proposed 
that new construction must include sea level rise projections into planning and development (ORR, 2018). Although this attention 
to climate-resilient development may help reduce income inequality, its full effect could be constrained if a policy focus on resilience 
obscures analysis of income redistribution for the poor (Fainstein, 2018).
Kampala, Uganda: Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has the statutory responsibility for managing the city.  The Kampala 
Climate Change Action Strategy (KCCAS) is responding to climatic impacts of elevated temperature and more intense, erratic rain. 
KCCAS has considered multi-scale and temporal aspects of response (Chelleri et al., 2015; Douglas, 2017; Fraser et al., 2017), 
strengthened community adaptation  (Lwasa, 2010; Dobson, 2017), responded to differential adaptive capacities (Waters and 
Adger, 2017) and believes in participatory processes and bridging of citywide linkages (KCCA, 2016). Analysis of the implications 
of uniquely adapted local solutions (e.g., motorcycle taxis) suggests sustainability can be enhanced when planning recognizes the 
need to adapt to uniquely local solutions (Evans et al., 2018).

climate-proof Rotterdam (RCI, 2017). Rotterdam has an integrated adaptation strategy, built on flood management, accessibility, 
adaptive building, urban water systems and urban climate, defined through the Rotterdam Climate Proof programme and the 
Rotterdam Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (RCI, 2008, 2013). Governance mechanisms that enabled integration of flood 
risk management plans with other policies, citizen participation, institutional eco-innovation, and focusing on green infrastructure 
(Albers et al., 2015; Dircke and Molenaar, 2015; de Boer et al., 2016a; Huang-Lachmann and Lovett, 2016) have contributed to 
effective adaptation (Ward et al., 2013). Entrenched institutional characteristics constrain the response framework (Francesch-
Huidobro et al., 2017), but emerging evidence suggests that new governance arrangements and structures can potentially overcome 
these barriers in Rotterdam (Hölscher et al., 2018).

4.3.6 
Short-Lived Climate Forcers
The main short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) emissions that cause 
warming are methane (CH4), other precursors of tropospheric ozone 
(i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds 
(NMVOC), black carbon (BC) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); Myhre et 
al., 2013). SLCFs also include emissions that lead to cooling, such as 
sulphur dioxide (SO2) and organic carbon (OC). Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
can have both warming and cooling effects, by affecting ozone (O3) 
and CH4, depending on time scale and location (Myhre et al., 2013).
Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1 provides a discussion of role of 
SLCFs in comparison to long-lived GHGs. Chapter 2 shows that 
1.5°C-consistent pathways require stringent reductions in CO2 and 
CH4, and that non-CO2 climate forcers reduce carbon budgets by 
about 2200 GtCO2 per degree of warming attributed to them (see the 
Supplementary Material to Chapter 2).
Reducing non-CO2 emissions is part of most mitigation pathways 
(IPCC, 2014c). All current GHG emissions and other forcing agents 
affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few 
decades, while long-term warming is mainly driven by CO2 emissions. 
CO2 emissions result in a virtually permanent warming, while 
temperature change from SLCFs disappears within decades after 
emissions of SLCFs are ceased. Any scenario that fails to reduce CO2 
emissions to net zero would not limit global warming, even if SLCFs are 
reduced, due to accumulating CO2-induced warming that overwhelms 
SLCFs’ mitigation benefits in a couple of decades (Shindell et al., 2012; 
Schmale et al., 2014) (and see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.2).
Mitigation options for warming SLCFs often overlap with other 
mitigation options, especially since many warming SLCFs are 
co-emitted with CO2. SLCFs are generally mitigated in 1.5°C- or 
2°C-consistent pathways as an integral part of an overall mitigation 
strategy (Chapter 2). For example, Section 2.3 indicates that most very-
low-emissions pathways include a transition away from the use of coal 
and natural gas in the energy sector and oil in transportation, which 
coincides with emission-reduction strategies related to methane from 
the fossil fuel sector and BC from the transportation sector. Much SLCF 
emission reduction aims at BC-rich sectors and considers the impacts 
of several co-emitted SLCFs (Bond et al., 2013; Sand et al., 2015; Stohl 
et al., 2015). The benefits of such strategies depend greatly upon the 
assumed level of progression of access to modern energy for the 
poorest populations who still rely on biomass fuels, as this affects the 
reference level of BC emissions (Rogelj et al., 2014).
Some studies have evaluated the focus on SLCFs in mitigation strategies 
and point towards trade-offs between short-term SLCF benefits 
and lock-in of long-term CO2 warming (Smith and Mizrahi, 2013; 
Pierrehumbert, 2014). Reducing fossil fuel combustion will reduce 
aerosols levels, and thereby cause warming from removal of aerosol 
cooling effects (Myhre et al., 2013; Xu and Ramanathan, 2017; Samset 
et al., 2018). While some studies have found a lower temperature effect 
from BC mitigation, thus questioning the effectiveness of targeted BC 
mitigation for climate change mitigation (Myhre et al., 2013; Baker et 
al., 2015; Stjern et al., 2017; Samset et al., 2018), other models and 
observationally constrained estimates suggest that these widely-used 
models do not fully capture observed effects of BC and co-emissions 
on climate (e.g., Bond et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2016). 
Table 4.5 provides an overview of three warming SLCFs and their 
emission sources, with examples of options for emission reductions 
and associated co-benefits.
A wide range of options to reduce SLCF emissions was extensively 
discussed in AR5 (IPCC, 2014b). Fossil fuel and waste sector methane 
mitigation options have high cost-effectiveness, producing a net profit 
over a few years, considering market costs only. Moreover, reducing 
roughly one-third to one-half of all human-caused emissions has 
societal benefits greater than mitigation costs when considering 
environmental impacts only (UNEP, 2011; Höglund-Isaksson, 2012; IEA, 
2017b; Shindell et al., 2017a). Since AR5, new options for methane, 
such as those related to shale gas, have been included in mitigation 
portfolios (e.g., Shindell et al., 2017a). 
Reducing BC emissions and co-emissions has sustainable development 
co-benefits, especially around human health (Stohl et al., 2015; 
Haines et al., 2017; Aakre et al., 2018), avoiding premature deaths 
and increasing crop yields (Scovronick et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016). 
Additional benefits include lower likelihood of non-linear climate 
changes and feedbacks (Shindell et al., 2017b) and temporarily slowing 
down the rate of sea level rise (Hu et al., 2013). Interventions to reduce 
BC offer tangible local air quality benefits, increasing the likelihood of 
local public support (Eliasson, 2014; Venkataraman et al., 2016) (see 
Chapter 5, Section 5.4.2.1). Limited interagency co-ordination, poor 
science-policy interactions (Zusman et al., 2015), and weak policy and

rest of the details as referenced). 
absence of inspections and enforcement (Kholod and Evans, 2016) are 
among barriers that reduce the institutional feasibility of options to 
reduce vehicle-induced BC emissions. A case study for India shows that 
switching from biomass cook stoves to cleaner gas stoves (based on 
liquefied petroleum gas or natural gas) or to electric cooking stoves is 
technically and economically feasible in most areas, but faces barriers 
in user preferences, costs and the organization of supply chains 
(Jeuland et al., 2015). Similar feasibility considerations emerge in 
switching from kerosene wick lamps for lighting to solar lanterns, from 
current low-efficiency brick kilns and coke ovens to cleaner production 
technologies; and from field burning of crop residues to agricultural 
practices using deep-sowing and mulching technologies (Williams et 
al., 2011; Wong, 2012). 
The radiative forcing from HFCs are currently small but have been 
growing rapidly (Myhre et al., 2013). The Kigali Amendment (from 
2016) to the Montreal Protocol set out a global accord for phasing 
out these compounds (Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2017). HFC mitigation 
options include alternatives with reduced warming effects, ideally 
combined with improved energy efficiency so as to simultaneously 
reduce CO2 and co-emissions (Shah et al., 2015). Costs for most 
of HFC’s mitigation potential are estimated to be below USD2010 
60 tCO2-eq−1, and the remainder below roughly double that number 
(Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2017). 
Reductions in SLCFs can provide large benefits towards sustainable 
development, beneficial for social, institutional and economic 
feasibility. Strategies that reduce SLCFs can provide benefits that 
include improved air quality (e.g., Anenberg et al., 2012) and crop yields 
(e.g., Shindell et al., 2012), energy access, gender equality and poverty 
eradication (e.g.,Shindell et al., 2012; Haines et al., 2017). Institutional 
feasibility can be negatively affected by an information deficit, with 
the absence of international frameworks for integrating SLCFs into 
emissions accounting and reporting mechanisms being a barrier to 
developing policies for addressing SLCF emissions (Venkataraman et 
al., 2016). The incentives for reducing SLCFs are particularly strong for 
small groups of countries, and such collaborations could increase the 
feasibility and effectiveness of SLCF mitigation options (Aakre et al., 
2018).
4.3.7 
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)
CDR methods refer to a set of techniques for removing CO2 from the 
atmosphere. In the context of 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Chapter 2), 
they serve to offset residual emissions and, in most cases, achieve net 
negative emissions to return to 1.5°C from an overshoot. See Cross-
Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3 for a synthesis of land-based CDR options. 
Cross-cutting issues and uncertainties are summarized in Table 4.6.
4.3.7.1 Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
BECCS has been assessed in previous IPCC reports (IPCC, 2005b, 
2014b; P. Smith et al., 2014; Minx et al., 2017) and has been 
incorporated into integrated assessment models (Clarke et al., 2014), 
but also 1.5°C-consistent pathways without BECCS have emerged 
(Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; Mousavi and Blesl, 2018; van 
Vuuren et al., 2018). Still, the overall set of  pathways limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot indicates that 0–1, 0–8, 
and 0–16 GtCO2 yr−1 would be removed by BECCS by 2030, 2050 and 
2100, respectively (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4). BECCS is constrained by 
sustainable bioenergy potentials (Section 4.3.1.2, Chapter 5, Section 
5.4.1.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3), and availability of 
safe storage for CO2 (Section 4.3.1.6). Literature estimates for BECCS 
mitigation potentials in 2050 range from 1–85 GtCO2
4. Fuss et al.

As more bottom-up literature exists on bioenergy potentials, this exercise explored the bioenergy literature and converted those estimates to BECCS potential with 1EJ of 
bioenergy yielding 0.02–0.05 GtCO2 emission reduction. For the bottom-up literature references for the potentials range, please refer to Supplementary Material 4.SM.3

Chapter 4
(2018) narrow this range to 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr−1 (medium agreement, 
high evidence) (Figure 4.3), meaning that BECCS mitigation potentials 
are not necessarily sufficient for 1.5°C-consistent pathways. This is, 
among other things, related to sustainability concerns (Boysen et al., 
2017; Heck et al., 2018; Henry et al., 2018).
Assessing BECCS deployment in 2°C pathways (of about 12 
GtCO2-eq yr−1 by 2100, considered as a conservative deployment 
estimate for BECCS-accepting pathways consistent with 1.5°C), Smith 
et al. (2016b) estimate a land-use intensity of 0.3–0.5 ha tCO2-eq−1 yr−1 
using forest residues, 0.16 ha CO2-eq−1 yr−1 for agricultural residues, 
and 0.03–0.1 ha tCO2-eq−1 yr−1 for purpose-grown energy crops. The 
average amount of BECCS in these pathways requires 25–46% of 
arable and permanent crop area in 2100. Land area estimates differ 
in scale and are not necessarily a good indicator of competition with, 
for example, food production, because requiring a smaller land area for 
the same potential could indicate that high-productivity agricultural 
land is used. In general, the literature shows low agreement on the 
availability of land (Fritz et al., 2011; see Erb et al., 2016b for recent 
advances). Productivity, food production and competition with other 
ecosystem services and land use by local communities are important 
factors for designing regulation. These potentials and trade-offs are not 
homogenously distributed across regions. However, Robledo-Abad et 
al. (2017) find that regions with higher potentials are understudied, 
given their potential contribution. Researchers have expressed the 
need to complement global assessments with regional, geographically 
explicit bottom-up studies of biomass potentials and socio-economic 
impacts (e.g., de Wit and Faaij, 2010; Kraxner et al., 2014; Baik et al., 
2018).
Energy production and land and water footprints show wide ranges 
in bottom-up assessments due to differences in technology, feedstock 
and other parameters (−1–150 EJ yr−1 of energy, 109–990 Mha, 6–79 
MtN, 218–4758 km3 yr−1 of water per GtCO2 yr−1; Smith and Torn, 
2013; Smith et al., 2016b; Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017) and are not 
comparable to IAM pathways which consider system effects (Bauer 
et al., 2018). Global impacts on nutrients and albedo are difficult to 
quantify (Smith et al., 2016b). BECCS competes with other land-based 
CDR and mitigation measures for resources (Chapter 2).  
There is uncertainty about the feasibility of timely upscaling (Nemet et 
al., 2018). CCS (see Section 4.3.1) is largely absent from the Nationally 
Determined Contributions (Spencer et al., 2015) and lowly ranked in 
investment priorities (Fridahl, 2017). Although there are dozens of small-
scale BECCS demonstrations (Kemper, 2015) and a full-scale project 
capturing 1 MtCO2 exists (Finley, 2014), this is well below the numbers 
associated with 1.5°C or 2°C-compatible pathways (IEA, 2016a; 
Peters et al., 2017). Although the majority of BECCS cost estimates are 
below 200 USD tCO2
−1 (Figure 4.2), estimates vary widely. Economic 
incentives for ramping up large CCS or BECCS infrastructure are weak 
(Bhave et al., 2017). The 2050 average investment costs for such a 
BECCS infrastructure for bio-electricity and biofuels are estimated at 
138 and 123 billion USD yr−1, respectively (Smith et al., 2016b). 
BECCS deployment is further constrained by bioenergy’s carbon 
accounting, land, water and nutrient requirements (Section 4.3.1), its 
compatibility with other policy goals and limited public acceptance of 
both bioenergy and CCS (Section 4.3.1). Current pathways are believed 
to have inadequate assumptions on the development of societal 
support and governance structures (Vaughan and Gough, 2016). 
However, removing BECCS and CCS from the portfolio of available 
options significantly raises modelled mitigation costs (Kriegler et al., 
2013; Bauer et al., 2018).
4.3.7.2 Afforestation and reforestation (AR) 
Afforestation implies planting trees on land not forested for a long 
time (e.g., over the last 50 years in the context of the Kyoto Protocol), 
while reforestation implies re-establishment of forest formations after 
a temporary condition with less than 10% canopy cover due to human-
induced or natural perturbations. Houghton et al. (2015) estimate 
about 500 Mha could be available for the re-establishment of forests 
on lands previously forested, but not currently used productively. This 
could sequester at least 3.7 GtCO2 yr−1 for decades. The full literature 
range gives 2050 potentials of 1–7 GtCO2 yr−1 (low evidence, medium 
agreement), narrowed down to 0.5–3.6 GtCO2 yr−1 based on a number 
of constraints (Fuss et al., 2018). Abatement costs are estimated to 
be low compared to other CDR options, 5–50 USD tCO2-eq−1 (robust 
evidence, high agreement). Yet, realizing such large potentials comes 
at higher land and water footprints than BECCS, although there would 
be a positive impact on nutrients and the energy requirement would 
be negligible (Smith et al., 2016b; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3). 
The 2030 estimate by Griscom et al. (2017) is up to 17.9 GtCO2 yr−1 
for reforestation with significant co-benefits (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter 3).
Biogenic storage is not as permanent as emission reductions by 
geological storage. In addition, forest sinks saturate, a process which 
typically occurs in decades to centuries compared to the thousands 
of years of residence time of CO2 stored geologically (Smith et al., 
2016a) and is subject to disturbances that can be exacerbated by 
climate change (e.g., drought, forest fires and pests) (Seidl et al., 2017). 
Handling these challenges requires careful forest management. There 
is much practical experience with AR, facilitating upscaling but with 
two caveats: AR potentials are heterogeneously distributed (Bala et al., 
2007), partly because the planting of less reflective forests results in 
higher net absorbed radiation and localised surface warming in higher 
latitudes (Bright et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2015), and forest governance 
structures and monitoring capacities can be bottlenecks and are 
usually not considered in models (Wang et al., 2016; Wehkamp et al., 
2018b). There is medium agreement on the positive impacts of AR on 
ecosystems and biodiversity due to different forms of afforestation 
discussed in the literature: afforestation of grassland ecosystems or 
diversified agricultural landscapes with monocultures or invasive alien 
species can have significant negative impacts on biodiversity, water 
resources, etc. (P. Smith et al., 2014), while forest ecosystem restoration 
(forestry and agroforestry) with native species can have positive social 
and environmental impacts (Cunningham et al., 2015; Locatelli et al., 
2015; Paul et al., 2016; See Section 4.3.2). 
Synergies with other policy goals are possible (see also Section 4.5.4); 
for example, land spared by diet shifts could be afforested (Röös et al., 
2017) or used for energy crops (Grubler et al., 2018). Such land-sparing 
strategies could also benefit other land-based CDR options.

4.3.7.3 Soil carbon sequestration and biochar
At local scales there is robust evidence that soil carbon sequestration 
(SCS, e.g., agroforestry, De Stefano and Jacobson, 2018), restoration 
of degraded land (Griscom et al., 2017), or conservation agriculture 
management practices (Aguilera et al., 2013; Poeplau and Don, 2015; 
Vicente-Vicente et al., 2016) have co-benefits in agriculture and that 
many measures are cost-effective even without supportive climate 
policy. Evidence at global scale for potentials and especially costs is 
much lower. The literature spans cost ranges of −45–100 USD tCO2
−1 
(negative costs relating to the multiple co-benefits of SCS, such as 
increased productivity and resilience of soils; P. Smith et al., 2014), 
and 2050 potentials are estimated at between 0.5 and 11 GtCO2 yr−1, 
narrowed down to 2.3–5.3 GtCO2 yr−1 considering that studies above 
5 GtCO2 yr−1 often do not apply constraints, while estimates lower than 
2 GtCO2 yr−1 mostly focus on single practices (Fuss et al., 2018). 
SCS has negligible water and energy requirements (Smith, 2016), 
affects nutrients and food security favourably (high agreement, robust 
evidence) and can be applied without changing current land use, thus 
making it socially more acceptable than CDR options with a high land 
footprint. However, soil sinks saturate after 10–100 years, depending 
on the SCS option, soil type and climate zone (Smith, 2016).
Biochar is formed by recalcitrant (i.e., very stable) organic carbon 
obtained from pyrolysis, which, applied to soil, can increase soil carbon 
sequestration leading to improved soil fertility properties.5 Looking at 
the full literature range, the global potential in 2050 lies between 1 
and 35 Gt CO2 yr−1 (low agreement, low evidence), but considering 
limitations in biomass availability and uncertainties due to a lack of 
large-scale trials of biochar application to agricultural soils under field 
conditions, Fuss et al. (2018) lower the 2050 range to 0.3–2 GtCO2 yr−1. 
This potential is below previous estimates (e.g., Woolf et al., 2010), 
which additionally consider the displacement of fossil fuels through 
biochar. Permanence depends on soil type and biochar production 
temperatures, varying between a few decades and several centuries 
(Fang et al., 2014). Costs are 30– 120 USD tCO2
−1 (medium agreement, 
medium evidence) (McCarl et al., 2009; McGlashan et al., 2012; 
McLaren, 2012; Smith, 2016).
Water requirements are low and at full theoretical deployment, up 
to 65 EJ yr−1 of energy could be generated as a side product (Smith, 
2016). Positive side effects include a favourable effect on nutrients and 
reduced N2O emissions (Cayuela et al., 2014; Kammann et al., 2017). 
However, 40–260 Mha are needed to grow the biomass for biochar 
for implementation at 0.3 GtCO2-eq yr−1 (Smith, 2016), even though 
it is also possible to use residues (e.g., Windeatt et al., 2014). Biochar 
is further constrained by the maximum safe holding capacity of soils 
(Lenton, 2010) and the labile nature of carbon sequestrated in plants 
and soil at higher temperatures (Wang et al., 2013).
4.3.7.4 Enhanced weathering (EW) and ocean alkalinization
Weathering is the natural process of rock decomposition via chemical 
and physical processes in which CO2 is spontaneously consumed and 
converted to solid or dissolved alkaline bicarbonates and/or carbonates 
(IPCC, 2005a). The process is controlled by temperature, reactive 
surface area, interactions with biota and, in particular, water solution 
composition. CDR can be achieved by accelerating mineral weathering 
through the distribution of ground-up rock material over land 
(Hartmann and Kempe, 2008; Wilson et al., 2009; Köhler et al., 2010; 
Renforth, 2012; ten Berge et al., 2012; Manning and Renforth, 2013; 
Taylor et al., 2016), shorelines (Hangx and Spiers, 2009; Montserrat et 
al., 2017) or the open ocean (House et al., 2007; Harvey, 2008; Köhler 
et al., 2013; Hauck et al., 2016). Ocean alkalinization adds alkalinity to 
marine areas to locally increase the CO2 buffering capacity of the ocean 
(González and Ilyina, 2016; Renforth and Henderson, 2017).  
In the case of land application of ground minerals, the estimated CDR 
potential range is 0.72–95 GtCO2 yr−1 (low evidence, low agreement) 
(Hartmann and Kempe, 2008; Köhler et al., 2010; Hartmann et al., 
2013; Taylor et al., 2016; Strefler et al., 2018a). Marine application 
of ground minerals is limited by feasible rates of mineral extraction, 
grinding and delivery, with estimates of 1–6 GtCO2 yr−1 (low evidence, 
low agreement) (Köhler et al., 2013; Hauck et al., 2016; Renforth and 
Henderson, 2017). Agreement is low due to a variety of assumptions 
and unknown parameter ranges in the applied modelling procedures 
that would need to be verified by field experiments (Fuss et al., 2018). 
As with other CDR options, scaling and maturity are challenges, with 
deployment at scale potentially requiring decades (NRC, 2015a), 
considerable costs in transport and disposal (Hangx and Spiers, 2009; 
Strefler et al., 2018a) and mining (NRC, 2015a; Strefler et al., 2018a)6.
Site-specific cost estimates vary depending on the chosen technology 
for rock grinding (an energy-intensive process; Köhler et al., 2013; 
Hauck et al., 2016), material transport, and rock source (Renforth, 
2012; Hartmann et al., 2013), and range from 15–40 USD tCO2
−1 to 
3,460 USD tCO2
−1 (limited evidence, low agreement; Figure 4.2) 
(Schuiling and Krijgsman, 2006; Köhler et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 
2016). The evidence base for costs of ocean alkalinization and marine 
enhanced weathering is sparser than the land applications. The ocean 
alkalinization potential is assessed to be 0.1–10 GtCO2 yr−1 with costs 
of 14– >500 USD tCO2
−1 (Renforth and Henderson, 2017).
The main side effects of terrestrial EW are an increase in water pH 
(Taylor et al., 2016), the release of heavy metals like Ni and Cr and plant 
nutrients like K, Ca, Mg, P and Si (Hartmann et al., 2013), and changes in 
hydrological soil properties. Respirable particle sizes, though resulting in 
higher potentials, can have impacts on health (Schuiling and Krijgsman, 
2006; Taylor et al., 2016); utilization of wave-assisted decomposition 
through deployment on coasts could avert the need for fine grinding 
(Hangx and Spiers, 2009; Schuiling and de Boer, 2010). Side effects

Other pyrolysis products that can achieve net CO2 removals are bio-oil (pumped into geological storages) and permanent-pyrogas (capture and storage of CO2 from gas 
combustion) (Werner et al., 2018)

It has also been suggested that ocean alkalinity can be increased through accelerated weathering of limestone (Rau and Caldeira, 1999; Rau, 2011; Chou et al., 2015) or  
 
electrochemical processes (House et al., 2007; Rau, 2008; Rau et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2015). However, these techniques have not been proven at large scale either  
 
(Renforth and Henderson, 2017).

of marine EW and ocean alkalinization are the potential release of 
heavy metals like Ni and Cr (Montserrat et al., 2017). Increasing ocean 
alkalinity helps counter ocean acidification (Albright et al., 2016; Feng 
et al., 2016). Ocean alkalinization could affect ocean biogeochemical 
functioning (González and Ilyina, 2016). A further caveat of relates to 
saturation state and the potential to trigger spontaneous carbonate 
precipitation.7 While the geochemical potential to remove and store 
CO2 is quite large, limited evidence on the preceding topics makes it 
difficult to assess the true capacity, net benefits and desirability of EW 
and ocean alkalinity addition in the context of CDR.
4.3.7.5 Direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage (DACCS)
Capturing CO2 from ambient air through chemical processes with 
subsequent storage of the CO2 in geological formations is independent 
of source and timing of emissions and can avoid competition for land. 
Yet, this is also the main challenge: while the theoretical potential 
for DACCS is mainly limited by the availability of safe and accessible 
geological storage, the CO2 concentration in ambient air is 100–300 
times lower than at gas- or coal-fired power plants (Sanz-Pérez et al., 
2016) thus requiring more energy than flue gas CO2 capture (Pritchard 
et al., 2015). This appears to be the main challenge to DACCS (Sanz-
Pérez et al., 2016; Barkakaty et al., 2017). 
Studies explore alternative techniques to reduce the energy penalty 
of DACCS (van der Giesen et al., 2017). Energy consumption could be 
up to 12.9 GJ tCO2-eq−1; translating into an average of 156 EJ yr−1 by 
2100 (current annual global primary energy supply is 600 EJ); water 
requirements are estimated to average 0.8–24.8 km3 GtCO2-eq−1 yr−1 
(Smith et al., 2016b, based on Socolow et al., 2011).
However, the literature shows low agreement and is fragmented 
(Broehm et al., 2015). This fragmentation is reflected in a large range 
of cost estimates: from 20–1,000 USD tCO2
−1 (Keith et al., 2006; Pielke, 
2009; House et al., 2011; Ranjan and Herzog, 2011; Simon et al., 2011; 
Goeppert et al., 2012; Holmes and Keith, 2012; Zeman, 2014; Sanz-
Pérez et al., 2016; Sinha et al., 2017). There is lower agreement and a 
smaller evidence base at the lower end of the cost range. Fuss et al. 
(2018) narrow this range to 100–300 USD tCO2
-1.
Research and efforts by small-scale commercialization projects focus 
on utilization of captured CO2 (Wilcox et al., 2017). Given that only 
a few IAM scenarios incorporate DACCS (e.g., Chen and Tavoni, 
2013; Strefler et al., 2018b) its possible role in cost-optimized 1.5°C 
scenarios is not yet fully explored. Given the technology’s early stage 
of development (McLaren, 2012; NRC, 2015a; Nemet et al., 2018) 
and few demonstrations (Holmes et al., 2013; Rau et al., 2013; Agee 
et al., 2016), deploying the technology at scale is still a considerable 
challenge, though both optimistic (Lackner et al., 2012) and pessimistic 
outlooks exist (Pritchard et al., 2015).
4.3.7.6 Ocean fertilization
Nutrients can be added to the ocean resulting in increased biologic 
production, leading to carbon fixation in the sunlit ocean and 
subsequent sequestration in the deep ocean or sea floor sediments. 
The added nutrients can be either micronutrients (such as iron) or 
macronutrients (such as nitrogen and/or phosphorous) (Harrison, 
2017). There is limited evidence and low agreement on the readiness of 
this technology to contribute to rapid decarbonization (Williamson et 
al., 2012). Only small-scale field experiments and theoretical modelling 
have been conducted (e.g., McLaren, 2012). The full range of CDR 
potential estimates is from 15.2 ktCO2 yr−1 (Bakker et al., 2001) for a 
spatially constrained field experiment up to 44 GtCO2 yr−1 (Sarmiento 
and Orr, 1991) following a modelling approach, but Fuss et al. (2018) 
consider the potential to be extremely limited given the evidence and 
existing barriers. Due to scavenging of iron, the iron addition only leads 
to inefficient use of the nitrogen in exporting carbon (Zeebe, 2005; 
Aumont and Bopp, 2006; Zahariev et al., 2008). 
Cost estimates range from 2 USD tCO2
−1 (for iron fertilization) (Boyd 
and Denman, 2008) to 457 USD tCO2
−1 (Harrison, 2013). Jones (2014) 
proposed values greater than 20 USD tCO2
−1 for nitrogen fertilization. 
Fertilization is expected to impact food webs by stimulating its base 
organisms (Matear, 2004), and extensive algal blooms may cause 
anoxia (Sarmiento and Orr, 1991; Matear, 2004; Russell et al., 2012) 
and deep water oxygen decline (Matear, 2004), with negative impacts 
on biodiversity. Nutrient inputs can shift ecosystem production from 
an iron-limited system to a P, N-, or Si-limited system depending on 
the location (Matear, 2004; Bertram, 2010) and non-CO2 GHGs may 
increase (Sarmiento and Orr, 1991; Matear, 2004; Bertram, 2010). The 
greatest theoretical potential for this practice is the Southern Ocean, 
posing challenges for monitoring and governance (Robinson et al., 
2014). The London Protocol of the International Maritime Organization 
has asserted authority for regulation of ocean fertilization (Strong et al., 
2009), which is widely viewed as a de facto moratorium on commercial 
ocean fertilization activities.
There is low agreement in the technical literature on the permanence 
of CO2 in the ocean, with estimated residence times of 1,600 years 
to millennia, especially if injected or buried in or below the sea floor 
(Williams and Druffel, 1987; Jones, 2014). Storage at the surface would 
mean that the carbon would be rapidly released after cessation (Zeebe, 
2005; Aumont and Bopp, 2006).

This analysis relies on the assessment in Fuss et al. (2018), which provides more detail on saturation and permanence.

Area of Uncertainty
Cross-Cutting Issues and Uncertainties
Technology upscaling
•  CDR options are at different stages of technological readiness (McLaren, 2012) and differ with respect to scalability.   
• Nemet et al. (2018) find >50% of the CDR innovation literature concerned with the earliest stages of the innovation process (R&D), identifying a  
    dissonance between the large CO2 removals needed in 1.5°C pathways and the long -time periods involved in scaling up novel technologies.  
• Lack of post-R&D literature, including incentives for early deployment, niche markets, scale up, demand, and public acceptance.
Emerging and niche 
technologies
• For BECCS, there are niche opportunities with high efficiencies and fewer trade-offs, for example, sugar and paper processing facilities (Möllersten et al., 2003), 
    district heating (Kärki et al., 2013; Ericsson and Werner, 2016), and industrial and municipal waste (Sanna et al., 2012). Turner et al. (2018) constrain potential using 
    sustainability considerations and overlap with storage basins to avoid the CO2 transportation challenge, providing a possible, though limited entry point for BECCS. 
• The impacts on land use, water, nutrients and albedo of BECCS could be alleviated using marine sources of biomass that could include aquacultured micro  
    and macro flora (Hughes et al., 2012; Lenton, 2014). 
• Regarding captured CO2 as a resource is discussed as an entry point for CDR. However, this does not necessarily lead to carbon removals, particularly if  
    the CO2 is sourced from fossil fuels and/or if the products do not store the CO2 for climate-relevant horizons (von der Assen et al., 2013) (see also Section 4.3.4.5).  
• Methane8 is a much more potent GHG than CO2 (Montzka et al., 2011), associated with difficult-to-abate emissions in industry and agriculture and with 
    outgassing from lakes, wetlands, and oceans (Lockley, 2012; Stolaroff et al., 2012). Enhancing processes that naturally remove methane, either by chemical 
    or biological decomposition (Sundqvist et al., 2012), has been proposed to remove CH4. There is low confidence that existing technologies for CH4 
    removal are economically or energetically suitable for large-scale air capture (Boucher and Folberth, 2010). Methane removal potentials are limited due to 
    its low atmospheric concentration and its low chemical reactivity at ambient conditions.
Ethical aspects
•  Preston (2013) identifies distributive and procedural justice, permissibility, moral hazard (Shue, 2018), and hubris as ethical aspects that could apply to  
    large-scale CDR deployment.  
•  There is a lack of reflection on the climate futures produced by recent modelling and implying very different ethical costs/risks and benefits (Minx et al., 2018).
Governance
• Existing governance mechanisms are scarce and either targeted at particular CDR options (e.g., ocean-based) or aspects (e.g., concerning indirect land-use  
    change (iLUC)) associated with bioenergy upscaling, and often the mechanisms are at national or regional scale (e.g., EU). Regulation accounting for iLUC  
    by formulating sustainability criteria (e.g., the EU Renewable Energy Directive) has been assessed as insufficient in avoiding leakage (e.g., Frank et al., 2013). 
• An international governance mechanism is only in place for R&D of ocean fertilization within the Convention on Biological Diversity (IMO, 1972, 1996; CBD, 2008, 2010). 
• Burns and Nicholson (2017) propose a human rights-based approach to protect those potentially adversely impacted by CDR options. 
Policy
• The CDR potentials that can be realized are constrained by the lack of policy portfolios incentivising large-scale CDR (Peters and Geden, 2017).   
• Near-term opportunities could be supported through modifying existing policy mechanisms (Lomax et al., 2015). 
• Scott and Geden (2018) sketch three possible routes for limited progress, (i) at EU-level, (ii) at EU Member State level, and (iii) at private sector level, noting  
    the implied paradigm shift this would entail.  
• EU may struggle to adopt policies for CDR deployment on the scale or time-frame envisioned by IAMs (Geden et al., 2018). 
• Social impacts of large-scale CDR deployment (Buck, 2016) require policies taking these into account.  
Carbon cycle
• On long time scales, natural sinks could reverse (C.D. Jones et al., 2016) 
• No robust assessments yet of the effectiveness of CDR in reverting climate change (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Keller et al., 2018), 
    see also Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2.2.

4.3.8 
Solar Radiation Modification (SRM)
This report refrains from using the term ‘geoengineering’ and separates 
SRM from CDR and other mitigation options (see Chapter 1, Section 
1.4.1 and Glossary).
Table 4.7 gives an overview of SRM methods and characteristics. For a 
more comprehensive discussion of currently proposed SRM methods, 
and their implications for geophysical quantities and sustainable 
development, see also Cross-Chapter Box 10 in this Chapter. This 
section assesses the feasibility, from an institutional, technological, 
economic and social-cultural viewpoint, focusing on stratospheric 
aerosol injection (SAI) unless otherwise indicated, as most available 
literature is about SAI.
Some of the literature on SRM appears in the forms of commentaries, 
policy briefs, viewpoints and opinions (e.g., (Horton et al., 2016; Keith et 
al., 2017; Parson, 2017). This assessment covers original research rather 
than viewpoints, even if the latter appear in peer-reviewed journals. 
SRM could reduce some of the global risks of climate change related 
to temperature rise (Izrael et al., 2014; MacMartin et al., 2014), rate of 
sea level rise (Moore et al., 2010), sea-ice loss (Berdahl et al., 2014) and 
frequency of extreme storms in the North Atlantic and heatwaves in 
Europe (Jones et al., 2018). SRM also holds risks of changing precipitation 
and ozone concentrations and potentially reductions in biodiversity 
(Pitari et al., 2014; Visioni et al., 2017a; Trisos et al., 2018). Literature 
only supports SRM as a supplement to deep mitigation, for example in 
overshoot scenarios (Smith and Rasch, 2013; MacMartin et al., 2018).
4.3.8.1 Governance and institutional feasibility
There is robust evidence but medium agreement for unilateral action 
potentially becoming a serious SRM governance issue (Weitzman, 
2015; Rabitz, 2016), as some argue that enhanced collaboration 
might emerge around SRM (Horton, 2011). An equitable institutional 
or governance arrangement around SRM would have to reflect 
views of different countries (Heyen et al., 2015) and be multilateral 
because of the risk of termination, and risks that implementation or 
unilateral action by one country or organization will produce negative 
precipitation or extreme weather effects across borders (Lempert and

Prosnitz, 2011; Dilling and Hauser, 2013; NRC, 2015b). Some have 
suggested that the governance of research and field experimentation 
can help clarify uncertainties surrounding deployment of SRM (Long 
and Shepherd, 2014; Parker, 2014; NRC, 2015c; Caldeira and Bala, 
2017; Lawrence and Crutzen, 2017), and that SRM is compatible with 
democratic processes (Horton et al., 2018) or not (Szerszynski et al., 
2013; Owen, 2014). 
Several possible institutional arrangements have been considered 
for SRM governance: under the UNFCCC (in particular under the 
Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)) or the 
United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) (Honegger 
et al., 2013; Nicholson et al., 2018), or through a consortium of 
states (Bodansky, 2013; Sandler, 2017). Reasons for states to join an 
international governance framework for SRM include having a voice in 
SRM diplomacy, prevention of unilateral action by others and benefits 
from research collaboration (Lloyd and Oppenheimer, 2014).
Alongside SBSTA, the WMO, UNESCO and UN Environment could play 
a role in governance of SRM (Nicholson et al., 2018). Each of these 
organizations has relevance with respect to the regulatory framework 
(Bodle et al., 2012; Williamson and Bodle, 2016). The UNCBD gives 
guidance that ‘that no climate-related geo-engineering activities that 
may affect biodiversity take place’ (CBD, 2010).  
4.3.8.2 Economic and technological feasibility
The literature on the engineering costs of SRM is limited and may 
be unreliable in the absence of testing or deployment. There is high 
agreement that costs of SAI (not taking into account indirect and social 
costs, research and development costs and monitoring expenses) may 
be in the range of 1–10 billion USD yr−1 for injection of 1–5 MtS to 
achieve cooling of 1–2 W m−2 (Robock et al., 2009; McClellan et al., 
2012; Ryaboshapko and Revokatova, 2015; Moriyama et al., 2016), 
suggesting that cost-effectiveness may be high if side-effects are low 
349

Chapter 4
or neglected (McClellan et al., 2012). The overall economic feasibility 
of SRM also depends on externalities and social costs (Moreno-Cruz 
and Keith, 2013; Mackerron, 2014), climate sensitivity (Kosugi, 2013), 
option value (Arino et al., 2016), presence of climate tipping points 
(Eric Bickel, 2013)  and damage costs as a function of the level of SRM 
(Bahn et al., 2015; Heutel et al., 2018). Modelling of game-theoretic, 
strategic interactions of states under heterogeneous climatic impacts 
shows low agreement on the outcome and viability of a cost-benefit 
analysis for SRM (Ricke et al., 2015; Weitzman, 2015). 
For SAI, there is high agreement that aircrafts could, after some 
modifications, inject millions of tons of SO2 in the lower stratosphere 
(at approximately 20 km; (Davidson et al., 2012; McClellan et al., 2012; 
Irvine et al., 2016).
4.3.8.3 Social acceptability and ethics
Ethical questions around SRM include those of international 
responsibilities for implementation, financing, compensation for 
negative effects, the procedural justice questions of who is involved 
in decisions, privatization and patenting, welfare, informed consent 
by affected publics, intergenerational ethics (because SRM requires 
sustained action in order to avoid termination hazards), and the 
so-called ‘moral hazard’ (Burns, 2011; Whyte, 2012; Gardiner, 2013; 
Lin, 2013; Buck et al., 2014; Klepper and Rickels, 2014; Morrow, 2014; 
Wong, 2014; Reynolds, 2015; Lockley and Coffman, 2016; McLaren, 
2016; Suarez and van Aalst, 2017; Reynolds et al., 2018). The literature 
shows low agreement on whether SRM research and deployment may 
lead policy-makers to reduce mitigation efforts and thus imply a moral 
hazard (Linnér and Wibeck, 2015). SRM might motivate individuals 
(as opposed to policymakers) to reduce their GHG emissions, but even 
a subtle difference in the articulation of information about SRM can 
influence subsequent judgements of favourability (Merk et al., 2016). 
The argument that SRM research increases the likelihood of deployment 
(the ‘slippery slope’ argument), is also made (Quaas et al., 2017), but 
some also found an opposite effect (Bellamy and Healey, 2018). 
Unequal representation and deliberate exclusion are plausible in 
decision-making on SRM, given diverging regional interests and the 
anticipated low resource requirements to deploy SRM (Ricke et al., 
2013). Whyte (2012) argues that the concerns, sovereignties, and 
experiences of indigenous peoples may particularly be at risk. 
The general public can be characterized as oblivious to and worried 
about SRM (Carr et al., 2013; Parkhill et al., 2013; Wibeck et al., 2017). 
An emerging literature discusses public perception of SRM, showing a 
lack of knowledge and unstable  opinions (Scheer and Renn, 2014). The 
perception of controllability affects legitimacy and public acceptability 
of SRM experiments (Bellamy et al., 2017). In Germany, laboratory 
work on SRM is generally approved of, field research much less so, 
and immediate deployment is largely rejected (Merk et al., 2015; Braun 
et al., 2017). Various factors could explain variations in the degree of 
rejection of SRM between Canada, China, Germany, Switzerland, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States (Visschers et al., 2017).

Solar radiation modification (SRM) refers to a range of radiation modification measures not related to greenhouse gas (GHG) 
mitigation that seek to limit global warming (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4.1). Most methods involve reducing the amount of incoming 
solar radiation reaching the surface, but others also act on the longwave radiation budget by reducing optical thickness and cloud 
lifetime (see Table 4.7). In the context of this report, SRM is assessed in terms of its potential to limit warming below 1.5°C in 
temporary overshoot scenarios as a way to reduce elevated temperatures and associated impacts (Irvine et al., 2016; Keith and 
Irvine, 2016; Chen and Xin, 2017; Sugiyama et al., 2017a; Visioni et al., 2017a; MacMartin et al., 2018). The inherent variability of the 
climate system would make it difficult to detect the efficacy or side-effects of SRM intervention when deployed in such a temporary 
scenario (Jackson et al., 2015). 
A. Potential SRM timing and magnitude
Published SRM approaches are summarized in Table 4.7. The timing and magnitude of potential SRM deployment depends on 
the temperature overshoot associated with mitigation pathways. All overshooting pathways make use of carbon dioxide removal. 
Therefore, if considered, SRM would only be deployed as a supplemental measure to large-scale carbon dioxide removal (Chapter 
2, Section 2.3). 
Cross-Chapter Box 10, Figure 1 below illustrates an example of how a hypothetical SRM deployment based on stratospheric aerosols 
injection (SAI) could be used to limit warming below 1.5°C using an ‘adaptive SRM’ approach (e.g., Kravitz et al., 2011; Tilmes et al., 
2016), where global mean temperature rise  exceeds 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial level by mid-century and returns below 1.5°C 
before 2100 with a 66% likelihood (see Chapter 2). In all such limited adaptive deployment scenarios, deployment of SRM only 
350

commences under conditions in which CO2 emissions have already fallen substantially below their peak level and are continuing to 
fall. In order to hold warming to 1.5°C, a hypothetical SRM deployment could span from one to several decades, with the earliest 
possible threshold exceedance occurring before mid-century. Over this duration, SRM has to compensate for warming that exceeds 
1.5°C (displayed with hatching on panel a) with a decrease in radiative forcing (panel b) which could be achieved with a rate of SAI 
varying between 0–5.9 MtSO2 yr−1 (panel c) (Robock et al., 2008; Heckendorn et al., 2009).
SAI is the most-researched SRM method, with high agreement that it could limit warming to below 1.5°C (Tilmes et al., 2016; 
Jones et al., 2018). The response of global temperature to SO2 injection, however, is uncertain and varies depending on the model 
parametrization and emission scenarios (Jones et al., 2011; Kravitz et al., 2011; Izrael et al., 2014; Crook et al., 2015; Niemeier and 
Timmreck, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016; Kashimura et al., 2017). Uncertainty also arises due to the nature and the optical properties of 
injected aerosols.

Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
Other approaches are less well researched, but the literature suggests that ground-based albedo modification (GBAM), marine cloud 
brightening (MCB) or cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) are not assessed to be able to substantially reduce overall global temperature 
(Irvine et al., 2011; Seneviratne et al., 2018). However, these SRM approaches are known to create spatially heterogeneous forcing 
and potentially more spatially heterogeneous climate effects, which may be used to mitigate regional climate impacts. This may 
be of most relevance in the case of GBAM when applied to crop and urban areas (Seneviratne et al., 2018). Most of the literature 
on regional mitigation has focused on GBAM in relationship with land-use and land-cover change scenarios. Both models and 
observations suggest that there is a high agreement that GBAM would result in cooling over the region of changed albedo, and in 
particular would reduce hot extremes (Irvine et al., 2011; Akbari et al., 2012; Jacobson and Ten Hoeve, 2012; Davin et al., 2014; Crook 
et al., 2015, 2016; Alkama and Cescatti, 2016; Seneviratne et al., 2018). In comparison, there is a limited evidence on the ability of 
MCB or CCT to mitigate regional climate impacts of 1.5°C warming because the magnitude of the climate response to MCB or CCT 
remains uncertain and the processes are not fully understood (Lohmann and Gasparini, 2017).
B. 
General consequences and impacts of solar radiation modification 
It has been proposed that deploying SRM as a supplement to mitigation may reduce increases in global temperature-related 
extremes and rainfall intensity, and lessen the loss of coral reefs from increasing sea-surface temperatures (Keith and Irvine, 2016), 
but it would not address, or could even worsen (Tjiputra et al., 2016), negative effects from continued ocean acidification.  
Another concern with SRM is the risk of  a ‘termination shock’ or ‘termination effect’ when suddenly stopping SRM, which might 
cause rapid temperature rise and associated impacts (Jones et al., 2013; Izrael et al., 2014; McCusker et al., 2014), most noticeably 
biodiversity loss (Trisos et al., 2018). The severity of the termination effect has recently been debated (Parker and Irvine, 2018) and 
depends on the degree of SRM cooling. This report only considers limited SRM in the context of mitigation pathways to 1.5°C. Other 
risks of SRM deployment could be associated with the lack of testing of the proposed deployment schemes (e.g., Schäfer et al., 
2013). Ethical aspects and issues related to the governance and economics are discussed in Section 4.3.8.
C. Consequences and impacts of SRM on the carbon budget
Because of its effects on surface temperature, precipitation and surface shortwave radiation, SRM would also alter the carbon 
budget pathways to 1.5°C or 2°C (Eliseev, 2012; Keller et al., 2014; Keith et al., 2017; Lauvset et al., 2017). 
Despite the large uncertainties in the simulated climate response to SRM, current model simulations suggest that SRM would 
lead to altered carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C. The 6 CMIP5 models investigated simulated an increase of natural 
carbon uptake by land biosphere and, to a smaller extent, by the oceans (high agreement). The multimodel mean of this response 
suggests an increase of the RCP4.5 carbon budget of about 150 GtCO2 after 50 years of SO2 injection with a rate of 4 TgS yr−1, which 
represents about 4 years of CO2 emissions at the current rate (36 GtCO2 yr−1). However, there is uncertainty around quantitative 
determination of the effects that SRM or its cessation has on the carbon budget due to a lack of understanding of the radiative 
processes driving the global carbon cycle response to SRM (Ramachandran et al., 2000; Mercado et al., 2009; Eliseev, 2012; Xia et 
al., 2016), uncertainties about how the carbon cycle will respond to termination effects of SRM, and uncertainties in climate–carbon 
cycle feedbacks (Friedlingstein et al., 2014).
D. Sustainable development and SRM
There are few studies investigating potential implications of SRM for sustainable development. These are based on a limited 
number of scenarios and hypothetical considerations, mainly referring to benefits from lower temperatures (Irvine et al., 2011; 
Nicholson, 2013; Anshelm and Hansson, 2014; Harding and Moreno-Cruz, 2016). Other studies suggest negative impacts from SRM 
implementation concerning issues related to regional disparities (Heyen et al., 2015), equity (Buck, 2012), fisheries, ecosystems, 
agriculture, and termination effects (Robock, 2012; Morrow, 2014; Wong, 2014). If SRM is initiated by the richer nations, there might 
be issues with local agency, and possibly worsening conditions for those suffering most under climate change (Buck et al., 2014). 
In addition, ethical issues related to testing SRM have been raised (e.g., Lenferna et al., 2017). Overall, there is high agreement that 
SRM would affect many development issues but limited evidence on the degree of influence, and how it manifests itself across 
regions and different levels of society.
E. 
Overall feasibility of SRM
If mitigation efforts do not keep global mean temperature below 1.5°C, SRM can potentially reduce the climate impacts of a 
temporary temperature overshoot, in particular extreme temperatures, rate of sea level rise and intensity of tropical cyclones, 
alongside intense mitigation and adaptation efforts. While theoretical developments show that SRM is technically feasible (see 
Section 4.3.8.2), global field experiments have not been conducted and most of the knowledge about SRM is based on imperfect

4.4 
Implementing Far-Reaching 
and Rapid Change
The feasibility of 1.5°C-compatible pathways is contingent upon 
enabling conditions for systemic change (see Cross Chapter Box 3 in 
Chapter 1). Section 4.3 identifies the major systems, and options within 
those systems, that offer the potential for change to align with 1.5°C 
pathways. 
AR5 identifies enabling conditions as influencing the feasibility 
of climate responses (Kolstad et al., 2014). This section draws on 
1.5°C-specific and related literature on rapid and scaled up change 
to identify the enabling conditions that influence the feasibility of 
adaptation and mitigation options assessed in Section 4.5. Examples 
from diverse regions and sectors are provided in Boxes 4.1 to 4.10 
to illustrate how these conditions could enable or constrain the 
implementation of incremental, rapid, disruptive and transformative 
mitigation and adaptation consistent with 1.5°C pathways. 
Coherence between the enabling conditions holds potential to enhance 
the feasibility of 1.5°C-consistent pathways and adapting to the 
consequences. This includes better alignment across governance scales 
(OECD, 2015a; Geels et al., 2017), enabling multilevel governance 
(Cheshmehzangi, 2016; Revi, 2017; Tait and Euston-Brown, 2017) and 
nested institutions (Abbott, 2012). It also includes interdisciplinary 
actions, combined adaptation and mitigation action (Göpfert et al., 
2018), and science–policy partnerships (Vogel et al., 2007; Hering et al., 
2014; Roberts, 2016; Figueres et al., 2017; Leal Filho et al., 2018). These 
partnerships are difficult to establish and sustain, but can generate 
trust (Cole, 2015; Jordan et al., 2015) and inclusivity that ultimately can 
provide durability and the realization of co-benefits for sustained rapid 
change (Blanchet, 2015; Ziervogel et al., 2016a). 
4.4.1 
Enhancing Multilevel Governance
Addressing climate change and implementing responses to 
1.5°C-consistent pathways would require engagement between 
various levels and types of governance (Betsill and Bulkeley, 2006; 
Kern and Alber, 2009; Christoforidis et al., 2013; Romero-Lankao et al., 
2018). AR5 highlighted the significance of governance as a means of 
strengthening adaptation and mitigation and advancing sustainable 
development (Fleurbaey et al., 2014). Governance is defined in the 
broadest sense as the ‘processes of interaction and decision-making 
among actors involved in a common problem’ (Kooiman, 2003; Hufty, 
2011; Fleurbaey et al., 2014). This definition goes beyond notions of 
formal government or political authority and integrates other actors, 
networks, informal institutions and communities. 
4.4.1.1 Institutions and their capacity to invoke far-reaching 
and rapid change
Institutions – the rules and norms that guide human interactions 
(Section 4.4.2) – enable or impede the structures, mechanisms 
and measures that guide mitigation and adaptation. Institutions, 
understood as the ‘rules of the game’ (North, 1990), exert direct and 
indirect influence over the viability of 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
(Munck et al., 2014; Willis, 2017). Governance would be needed to 
support wide-scale and effective adoption of mitigation and adaptation 
options. Institutions and governance structures are strengthened 
when the principle of the ‘commons’ is explored as a way of sharing 
management and responsibilities (Ostrom et al., 1999; Chaffin et 
al., 2014; Young, 2016). Institutions would need to be strengthened 
to interact amongst themselves, and to share responsibilities for the 
development and implementation of rules, regulations and policies 
(Ostrom et al., 1999; Wejs et al., 2014; Craig et al., 2017), with the goal 
of ensuring that these embrace equity, justice, poverty alleviation and 
sustainable development, enabling a 1.5°C world (Reckien et al., 2017; 
Wood et al., 2017). 
Several authors have identified different modes of cross-stakeholder 
interaction in climate policy, including the role played by large 
multinational corporations, small enterprises, civil society and non-
state actors. Ciplet et al. (2015) argue that civil society is to a great 
extent the only reliable motor for driving institutions to change at 
the pace required. Kern and Alber (2009) recognize different forms of 
collaboration relevant to successful climate policies beyond the local 
level. Horizontal collaboration (e.g., transnational city networks) and 
vertical collaboration within nation-states can play an enabling role 
(Ringel, 2017). Vertical and horizontal collaboration requires synergistic 
relationships between stakeholders (Ingold and Fischer, 2014; Hsu et 
al., 2017). The importance of community participation is emphasized 
in literature, and in particular the need to take into account equity 
and gender considerations (Chapter 5) (Graham et al., 2015; Bryan 
et al., 2017; Wangui and Smucker, 2017). Participation often faces 
implementation challenges and may not always result in better policy 
outcomes. Stakeholders, for example, may not view climate change as 
a priority and may not share the same preferences, potentially creating 
a policy deadlock (Preston et al., 2013, 2015; Ford et al., 2016).
4.4.1.2 International governance
International treaties help strengthen policy implementation, providing 
a medium- and long-term vision (Obergassel et al., 2016). International 
climate governance is organized via many mechanisms, including 
international organizations, treaties and conventions, for example, 
model simulations and some natural analogues. There are also considerable challenges to the implementation of SRM associated 
with disagreements over the governance, ethics, public perception, and distributional development impacts (see Section 4.3.8) (Boyd, 
2016; Preston, 2016; Asayama et al., 2017; Sugiyama et al., 2017b; Svoboda, 2017; McKinnon, 2018; Talberg et al., 2018). Overall, 
the combined uncertainties surrounding the various SRM approaches, including technological maturity, physical understanding, 
potential impacts, and challenges of governance, constrain the ability to implement SRM in the near future.

Chapter 4
UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement and the Montreal Protocol. Other 
multilateral and bilateral agreements, such as trade agreements, also 
have a bearing on climate change.
There are significant differences between global mitigation and 
adaptation governance frames. Mitigation tends to be global by its 
nature and based on the principle of the climate system as a global 
commons (Ostrom et al., 1999). Adaptation has traditionally been 
viewed as a local process, involving local authorities, communities, 
and stakeholders (Khan, 2013; Preston et al., 2015), although it is now 
recognized to be a multi-scaled, multi-actor process that transcends 
scales from local and sub-national to national and international 
(Mimura et al., 2014; UNEP, 2017a). National governments provide a 
central pivot for coordination, planning, determining policy priorities 
and distributing resources. National governments are accountable 
to the international community through international agreements. 
Yet, many of the impacts of climate change are transboundary, so 
that bilateral and multilateral cooperation are needed (Nalau et al., 
2015; Donner et al., 2016; Magnan and Ribera, 2016; Tilleard and Ford, 
2016; Lesnikowski et al., 2017). The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol demonstrates that a global environmental agreement 
facilitating common but differentiated responsibilities is possible 
(Sharadin, 2018). This was operationalized by developed countries 
acting first, with developing countries following and benefiting from 
leap-frogging the trial-and-error stages of innovative technology 
development.
Work on international climate governance has focused on the nature 
of ‘climate regimes’ and coordinating the action of nation-states 
(Aykut, 2016) organized around a diverse set of instruments: (i) binding 
limits allocated by principles of historical responsibility and equity, (ii) 
carbon prices, emissions quotas, (iii) pledges and review of policies and 
measures or (iv) a combination of these options (Stavins, 1988; Grubb, 
1990; Pizer, 2002; Newell and Pizer, 2003). 
Literature on the Kyoto Protocol provides two important insights for 
the 1.5°C transition: the challenge of agreeing on rules to allocate 
emissions quotas (Shukla, 2005; Caney, 2012; Winkler et al., 2013; 
Gupta, 2014; Méjean et al., 2015) and a climate-centric vision (Shukla, 
2005; BASIC experts, 2011), separated from development issues which 
drove resistance from many developing nations (Roberts and Parks, 
2006). For the former, a burden-sharing approach led to an adversarial 
process among nations to decide who should be allocated ‘how much’ 
of the remainder of the emissions budget (Caney, 2014; Ohndorf et al., 
2015; Roser et al., 2015; Giménez-Gómez et al., 2016). Industry group 
lobbying further contributed to reducing space for manoeuvre of some 
major emitting nations (Newell and Paterson, 1998; Levy and Egan, 
2003; Dunlap and McCright, 2011; Michaelowa, 2013; Geels, 2014).
Given the political unwillingness to continue with the Kyoto Protocol 
approach a new approach was introduced in the Copenhagen Accord, 
the Cancun Agreements, and finally in the Paris Agreement. The 
transition to 1.5°C requires carbon neutrality and thus going beyond 
the traditional framing of climate as a ‘tragedy of the commons’ to be 
addressed via cost-optimal allocation rules, which demonstrated a low 
probability of enabling a transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Patt, 
2017). The Paris Agreement, built on a ‘pledge and review’ system, 
is thought be more effective in securing trust (Dagnet et al., 2016) 
and enables effective monitoring and timely reporting on national 
actions (including adaptation), allowing for international scrutiny and 
persistent efforts of civil society and non-state actors to encourage 
action in both national and international contexts (Allan and Hadden, 
2017; Bäckstrand and Kuyper, 2017; Höhne et al., 2017; Lesnikowski et 
al., 2017; Maor et al., 2017; UNEP, 2017a), with some limitations (Nieto 
et al., 2018). 
The paradigm shift enabled at Cancun succeeded by focusing on the 
objective of ‘equitable access to sustainable development’ (Hourcade 
et al., 2015). The use of ‘pledge and review’ now underpins the Paris 
Agreement. This consolidates multiple attempts to define a governance 
approach that relies on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 
and on means for a ‘facilitative model’ (Bodansky and Diringer, 2014) 
to reinforce them. This enables a regular, iterative, review of NDCs 
allowing countries to set their own ambitions  after a global stocktake 
and more flexible, experimental forms of climate governance, which may 
provide room for higher ambition and be consistent with the needs of 
governing for a rapid transition to close the emission gap (Clémençon, 
2016; Falkner, 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this chapter). Beyond 
a general consensus on the necessity of measurement, reporting and 
verification (MRV) mechanisms as a key element of a climate regime 
(Ford et al., 2015b; van Asselt et al., 2015), some authors emphasize 
different governance approaches to implement the Paris Agreement. 
Through the new proposed sustainable development mechanism in 
Article 6, the Paris Agreement allows the space to harness the lowest 
cost mitigation options worldwide. This may incentivize policymakers 
to enhance mitigation ambition by speeding up climate action as part 
of a ‘climate regime complex’ (Keohane and Victor, 2011) of loosely 
interrelated global governance institutions. In the Paris Agreement, the 
‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’ 
(CBDR-RC) principle could be expanded and revisited under a ‘sharing 
the pie’ paradigm (Ji and Sha, 2015) as a tool to open innovation 
processes towards alternative development pathways (Chapter 5).
COP 16 in Cancun was also the first time in the UNFCCC that 
adaptation was recognized to have similar priority as mitigation. The 
Paris Agreement recognizes the importance of adaptation action and 
cooperation to enhance such action. Chung Tiam Fook (2017) and 
Lesnikowski et al. (2017) suggest that the Paris Agreement is explicit 
about multilevel adaptation governance, outlines stronger transparency 
mechanisms, links adaptation to development and climate justice, and 
is therefore suggestive of greater inclusiveness of non-state voices and 
the broader contexts of social change.
1.5°C-consistent pathways require further exploration of conditions of 
trust and reciprocity amongst nation states (Schelling, 1991; Ostrom 
and Walker, 2005). Some authors (Colman et al., 2011; Courtois et al., 
2015) suggest a departure from the vision of actors acting individually 
in the pursuit of self-interest to that of iterated games with actors 
interacting over time showing that reciprocity, with occasional 
forgiveness and initial good faith, can lead to win-win outcomes and 
to cooperation as a stable strategy (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981).
Regional cooperation plays an important role in the context of 
global governance. Literature on climate regimes has only started

exploring innovative governance arrangements, including coalitions 
of transnational actors including state, market and non-state actors 
(Bulkeley et al., 2012; Hovi et al., 2016; Hagen et al., 2017; Hermwille 
et al., 2017; Roelfsema et al., 2018) and groupings of countries, as 
a complement to the UNFCCC (Abbott and Snidal, 2009; Biermann, 
2010; Zelli, 2011; Nordhaus, 2015). Climate action requires multilevel 
governance from the local and community level to national, regional 
and international levels. Box 4.1 shows the role of sub-national 
authorities (e.g., regions and provinces) in facilitating urban climate 
action, while Box 4.2 shows that climate governance can be organized 
across hydrological as well as political units. 
4.4.1.3 Sub-national governance
Local governments can play a key role (Melica et al., 2018; Romero-
Lankao et al., 2018) in influencing mitigation and adaptation 
strategies. It is important to understand how rural and urban 
areas, small islands, informal settlements and communities might 
intervene to reduce climate impacts (Bulkeley et al., 2011), either by 
implementing climate objectives defined at higher government levels 
or by taking initiative autonomously or collectively (Aall et al., 2007; 
Reckien et al., 2014; Araos et al., 2016a; Heidrich et al., 2016). Local 
governance faces the challenge of reconciling local concerns with 
global objectives. Local governments could coordinate and develop 
effective local responses, and could pursue procedural justice in 
ensuring community engagement and more effective policies around 
energy and vulnerability reduction (Moss et al., 2013; Fudge et al., 
2016). They can enable more participative decision-making (Barrett, 
2015; Hesse, 2016). Fudge et al. (2016) argue that local authorities 
are well-positioned to involve the wider community in: designing 
and implementing climate policies, engaging with sustainable energy 
generation (e.g., by supporting energy communities) (Slee, 2015), and 
the delivery of demand-side measures and adaptation implementation. 
By 2050, it is estimated three billion people will be living in slums and 
informal settlements: neighbourhoods without formal governance, on 
un-zoned land developments and in places that are exposed to climate-
related hazards (Bai et al., 2018). Emerging research is examining how 
citizens can contribute informally to governance with rapid urbanization 
and weaker government regulation (Sarmiento and Tilly, 2018). It 
remains to be seen how the possibilities and consequences of alternative 
urban governance models will be managed for large, complex problems 
and for addressing inequality and urban adaptation (Amin and Cirolia, 
2018; Bai et al., 2018; Sarmiento and Tilly, 2018).
Expanding networks of cities are sharing experiences on coping with 
climate change and drawing economic and development benefits from 
climate change responses – a recent institutional innovation. This could 
be complemented by efforts of national governments to enhance local 
climate action through national urban policies (Broekhoff et al., 2018). 
Over the years, non-state actors have set up several transnational 
climate governance initiatives to accelerate the climate response, for 
example, ICLEI (1990), C–40 (2005), the Global Island Partnership 
(2006) and the Covenant of Mayors (2008) (Gordon and Johnson, 
2017; Hsu et al., 2017; Ringel, 2017; Kona et al., 2018; Melica et al., 
2018) and to exert influence on national governments and the UNFCCC 
(Bulkeley, 2005). However, Michaelowa and Michaelowa (2017) find 
low effectiveness for over 100 of such mitigation initiatives. 
4.4.1.4 Interactions and processes for multilevel governance
Literature has proposed multilevel governance in climate change as 
an enabler for systemic transformation and effective governance, 
as the concept is thought to allow for combining decisions across 
levels and sectors and across institutional types at the same level 
(Romero-Lankao et al., 2018), with multilevel reinforcement and the 
mobilization of economic interests at different levels of governance 
(Jänicke and Quitzow, 2017). These governance mechanisms are 
based on accountability and transparency rules and participation and 
coordination across and within these levels.
A study of 29 European countries showed that the rapid adoption 
and diffusion of adaptation policymaking is largely driven by internal 
factors, at the national and sub-national levels (Massey et al., 2014). 
An assessment of national-level adaptation in 117 countries (Berrang-
Ford et al., 2014) found good governance to be the one of the strongest 
predictors of national adaptation policy. An analysis of the climate 
responses of 200 large and medium-sized cities across eleven European 
countries found that factors such as membership of climate networks, 
population size, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and adaptive 
capacity act as drivers of mitigation and adaptation plans (Reckien et 
al., 2015). 
Adaptation policy has seen growth in some areas (Massey et al., 
2014; Lesnikowski et al., 2016), although efforts to track adaptation 
progress are constrained by an absence of data sources on adaptation 
(Berrang-Ford et al., 2011; Ford and Berrang-Ford, 2016; Magnan, 
2016; Magnan and Ribera, 2016). Many developing countries have 
made progress in formulating national policies, plans and strategies on 
responding to climate change. The NDCs have been identified as one 
such institutional mechanism (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this Chapter) 
(Magnan et al., 2015; Kato and Ellis, 2016; Peters et al., 2017). 
To overcome barriers to policy implementation, local conflicts of 
interest or vested interests, strong leadership and agency is needed by 
political leaders. As shown by the Covenant of Mayors initiative (Box 
4.1), political leaders with a vision for the future of the local community 
can succeed in reducing GHG emissions, when they are supported by 
civil society (Rivas et al., 2015; Croci et al., 2017; Kona et al., 2018). 
Any political vision would need to be translated into an action plan, 
which could include elements describing policies and measures needed 
to achieve transition, the human and financial resources needed, 
milestones, and appropriate measurement and verification processes 
(Azevedo and Leal, 2017). Discussing the plan with stakeholders 
and civil society, including citizens and allowing for participation for 
minorities, and having them provide input and endorse it, has been 
found to increase the likelihood of success (Rivas et al., 2015; Wamsler, 
2017). However, as described by Nightingale (2017) and Green (2016), 
struggles over natural resources and adaptation governance both at 
the national and community levels would also need to be addressed 
‘in politically unstable contexts, where power and politics shape 
adaptation outcomes’.

Box 4.1 |  Multilevel Governance in the EU Covenant of Mayors: Example of the Provincia di Foggia
Since 2005, cities have emerged as a locus of institutional and governance climate innovation (Melica et al., 2018) and are driving 
responses to climate change (Roberts, 2016). Many cities have adopted more ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction 
targets than countries (Kona et al., 2018), with an overall commitment of GHG emission reduction targets by 2020 of 27%, almost 
7 percentage points higher than the minimum target for 2020 (Kona et al., 2018). The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) is an initiative 
in which municipalities voluntarily commit to CO2 emission reduction. The participation of small municipalities has been facilitated 
by the development and testing of a new multilevel governance model involving Covenant Territorial Coordinators (CTCs), i.e., 
provinces and regions, which commit to providing strategic guidance and financial and technical support to municipalities in their 
territories. Results from the 315 monitoring inventories submitted show an achievement of 23% reduction in emissions (compared 
to an average year 2005) for more than half of the cities under a CTC schema (Kona et al., 2018).
The Province of Foggia, acting as a CTC, gave support to 36 municipalities to participate in the CoM and to prepare Sustainable 
Energy Action Plans (SEAPs). The Province developed a common approach to prepare SEAPs, provided data to compile municipal 
emission inventories (Bertoldi et al., 2018) and guided the signatory to identify an appropriate combination of measures to curb 
GHG emissions. The local Chamber of Commerce also had a key role in the implementation of these projects by the municipalities 
(Lombardi et al., 2016). The joint action by the province and the municipalities in collaboration with the local business community 
could be seen as an example of multilevel governance (Lombardi et al., 2016).  
Researchers have investigated local forms of collaboration within local government, with the active involvement of citizens and 
stakeholders, and acknowledge that public acceptance is key to the successful implementation of policies (Larsen and Gunnarsson-
Östling, 2009; Musall and Kuik, 2011; Pollak et al., 2011; Christoforidis et al., 2013; Pasimeni et al., 2014; Lee and Painter, 2015). 
Achieving ambitious targets would need leadership, enhanced multilevel governance, vision and widespread participation in 
transformative change (Castán Broto and Bulkeley, 2013; Rosenzweig et al., 2015; Castán Broto, 2017; Fazey et al., 2017; Wamsler, 
2017; Romero-Lankao et al., 2018). The Chapter 5, Section 5.6.4 case studies of climate-resilient development pathways, at state 
and community scales, show that participation, social learning and iterative decision-making are governance features of strategies 
that deliver mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable development in a fair and equitable manner. Another insight is the finding 
that incremental voluntary changes are amplified through community networking, polycentric governance (Dorsch and Flachsland, 
2017), partnerships, and long-term change to governance systems at multiple levels (Stevenson and Dryzek, 2014; Lövbrand et al., 
2017; Pichler et al., 2017; Termeer et al., 2017).
Multilevel governance includes adaptation across local, regional, and 
national scales (Adger et al., 2005). The whole-of-government approach 
to understanding and influencing climate change policy design and 
implementation puts analytical emphasis on how different levels of 
government and different types of actors (e.g., public and private) 
can constrain or support local adaptive capacity (Corfee-Morlot et al., 
2011), including the role of the civil society. National governments, 
for example, have been associated with enhancing adaptive capacity 
through building awareness of climate impacts, encouraging economic 
growth, providing incentives, establishing legislative frameworks 
conducive to adaptation, and communicating climate change 
information (Berrang-Ford et al., 2014; Massey et al., 2014; Austin et al., 
2015; Henstra, 2016; Massey and Huitema, 2016). Local governments, 
on the other hand, are responsible for delivering basic services and 
utilities to the urban population, and protecting their integrity from 
the impacts of extreme weather (Austin et al., 2015; Cloutier et al., 
2015; Nalau et al., 2015; Araos et al., 2016b). National policies and 
transnational governance could be seen as complementary, rather 
than competitors, and strong national policies favour transnational 
engagement of sub- and non-state actors (Andonova et al., 2017). 
Local initiatives are complementary with higher level policies and can 
be integrated in the multilevel governance system (Fuhr et al., 2018). 
A multilevel approach considers that adaptation planning is affected 
by scale mismatches between the local manifestation of climate 
impacts and the diverse scales at which the problem is driven (Shi 
et al., 2016). Multilevel approaches may be relevant in low-income 
countries where limited financial resources and human capabilities 
within local governments often lead to greater dependency on 
national governments and other (donor) organizations, to strengthen 
adaptation responses (Donner et al., 2016; Adenle et al., 2017). 
National governments or international organizations may motivate 
urban adaptation externally through broad policy directives or projects 
by international donors. Municipal governments on the other hand 
work within the city to spur progress on adaptation. Individual political 
leadership in municipal government, for example, has been cited as 
a factor driving the adaptation policies of early adapters in Quito, 
Ecuador, and Durban, and South Africa (Anguelovski et al., 2014), 
and for adaptation more generally (Smith et al., 2009). Adaptation 
pathways can help identify maladaptive actions (Juhola et al., 2016; 
Magnan et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2018) and encourage social learning 
approaches across multiple levels of stakeholders in sectors such as 
marine biodiversity and water supply (Bosomworth et al., 2015; Butler 
et al., 2015; van der Brugge and Roosjen, 2015).

Box 4.2 exemplifies how multilevel governance has been used for 
watershed management in different basins, given the impacts on water 
sources (Chapter 3, Section 3.4.2).
Box 4.2 |  Watershed Management in a 1.5˚C World
Water management is necessary in order for the global community to adapt to 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Cohesive planning 
that includes numerous stakeholders would be required to improve access, utilization and efficiency of water use and to ensure 
hydrologic viability.  
Response to drought and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in southern Guatemala
Hydro-meteorological events, including ENSO, have impacted Central America (Steinhoff et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2015; Maggioni et 
al., 2016) and are projected to increase in frequency during a 1.5°C transition (Wang et al., 2017). The 2014–2016 ENSO damaged 
agriculture, seriously impacting rural communities. 
In 2016, the Climate Change Institute, in conjunction with local governments, the private sector, communities and human rights 
organizations, established dialogue tables for different watersheds to discuss water usage amongst stakeholders and plans to 
mitigate the effects of drought, alleviate social tension, and map water use of watersheds at risk. The goal was to encourage better 
water resource management and to enhance ecological flow through improved communication, transparency, and coordination 
amongst users. These goals were achieved in 2017 when each previously affected river reached the Pacific Ocean with at least its 
minimum ecological flow (Guerra, 2017). 
Drought management through the Limpopo Watercourse Commission
The governments sharing the Limpopo river basin (Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe) formed the Limpopo 
Watercourse Commission in 2003 (Nyagwambo et al., 2008; Mitchell, 2013). It has an advisory body composed of working groups 
that assess water use and sustainability, decide national level distribution of water access, and support disaster and emergency 
planning. The Limpopo basin delta is highly vulnerable (Tessler et al., 2015), and is associated with a lack of infrastructure and 
investment capacity, requiring increased economic development together with plans for vulnerability reduction (Tessler et al., 
2015) and water rights (Swatuk, 2015). The high vulnerability is influenced by gender inequality, limited stakeholder participation 
and limited institutional capacity to address unequal water access (Mehta et al., 2014). The implementation of integrated water 
resources management (IWRM) would need to consider pre-existing social, economic, historical and cultural contexts (Merrey, 
2009; Mehta et al., 2014). The Commission therefore could play a role in improving participation and in providing an adaptable and 
equitable strategy for cross-border water sharing (Ekblom et al., 2017).
Flood management in the Danube
The Danube River Protection Convention is the official instrument for cooperation on transboundary water governance between 
the countries that share the Danube Basin. The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) provides 
a strong science–policy link through expert working groups dealing with issues including governance, monitoring and assessment, 
and flood protection (Schmeier, 2014). The Trans-National Monitoring Network (TNMN) was developed to undertake comprehensive 
monitoring of water quality (Schmeier, 2014). Monitoring of water quality constitutes almost 50% of ICPDR’s scientific publications, 
although ICPDR also works on governance, basin planning, monitoring, and IWRM, indicating its importance. The ICPDR is an 
example of IWRM ‘coordinating groundwater, surface water abstractions, flood management, energy production, navigation, and 
water quality’ (Hering et al., 2014).

Mitigation
1. Introduction
There is high agreement that Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are important for the global response to climate change 
and represent an innovative bottom-up instrument in climate change governance (Section 4.4.1), with contributions from all 
signatory countries (den Elzen et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2016; Luderer et al., 2018; Vrontisi et al., 2018). The 
global emission projections resulting from full implementation of the NDCs represent an improvement compared to business as 
usual (Rogelj et al., 2016) and current policies scenarios to 2030 (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Most G20 economies 
would require new policies and actions to achieve their NDC targets (den Elzen et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2016; UNEP, 2017b; 
Kuramochi et al., 2018).
2. The effect of NDCs on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
Several studies estimate global emission levels that would be achieved under the NDCs (e.g., den Elzen et al., 2016; Luderer et al., 
2016; Rogelj et al., 2016, 2017; Vandyck et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2017; Vrontisi et al., 2018). Rogelj et al. (2016) and UNEP (2017b) 
concluded that the full implementation of the unconditional and conditional NDCs are expected to result in global GHG emissions 
of about 55 (52–58) and 53 (50–54) GtCO2-eq yr−1, respectively (Cross-Chapter Box 11, Figure 1 below).
3. The effect of NDCs on temperature increase and carbon budget
Estimates of global average temperature increase are 2.9°C–3.4°C above preindustrial levels with a greater than 66% probability 
by 2100 (Rogelj et al., 2016; UNEP, 2017b), under a full implementation of unconditional NDCs and a continuation of climate action 
similar to that of the NDCs. Full implementation of the conditional NDCs would lower the estimates by about 0.2°C by 2100. As 
an indication of the carbon budget implications of NDC scenarios, Rogelj et al. (2016) estimated cumulative emissions in the range

higher. Using IPCC AR4 instead of SAR GWP values is estimated to result in a 2–3% increase in estimated 1.5°C and 2°C emissions levels in 2030. Source: based on

of 690 to 850 GtCO2 for the period 2011–2030 if the NDCs are successfully implemented. The carbon budget for post-2010 till 2100 
compatible with staying below 1.5°C with a 50–66% probability was estimated at  550–600 GtCO2 (Clarke et al., 2014; Rogelj et al., 
2016), which will be well exceeded by 2030 at full implementation of the NDCs (Chapter 2, Section 2.2 and Section 2.3.1). 
4. The 2030 emissions gap with 1.5°C and urgency of action
As the 1.5°C pathways require reaching carbon neutrality by mid-century, the NDCs alone are not sufficient, as they have a time 
horizon until 2030. Rogelj et al. (2016) and Hof et al. (2017) have used results or compared NDC pathways with emissions pathways 
produced by integrated assessment models (IAMs) assessing the contribution of NDCs to achieve the 1.5°C targets. There is high 
agreement that current NDC emissions levels are not in line with pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century 
(Rogelj et al., 2016, 2017; Hof et al., 2017; UNEP, 2017b; Vrontisi et al., 2018). The median 1.5°C emissions gap (>66% chance) for 
the full implementation of both the conditional and unconditional NDCs for 2030 is 26 (19–29) to 28 (22–33) GtCO2-eq (Cross-
Chapter Box 11, Figure 1 above). 
Studies indicate important trade-offs of delaying global emissions reductions (Chapter 2, Sections 2.3.5 and 2.5.1). AR5 identified 
flexibility in 2030 emission levels when pursuing a 2°C objective (Clarke et al., 2014) indicating that strongest trade-offs for 2°C 
pathways could be avoided if emissions are limited to below 50 GtCO2-eq yr−1 in 2030 (here computed with the GWP–100 metric 
of the IPCC SAR). New scenario studies show that full implementation of the NDCs by 2030 would imply the need for deeper and 
faster emission reductions beyond 2030 in order to meet 2°C, and also higher costs and efforts of negative emissions (Fujimori et 
al., 2016; Sanderson et al., 2016; Rose et al., 2017; van Soest et al., 2017; Luderer et al., 2018). However, no flexibility has been found 
for 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Luderer et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2017), indicating that if emissions through 2030 are at NDC levels, 
the resulting post-2030 reductions required to remain within a 1.5°C-consistent carbon budget during the 21st century (Chapter 2, 
Section 2.2) are not within the feasible operating space of IAMs. This indicates that the chances of failing to reach a 1.5°C pathway 
are significantly increased (Riahi et al., 2015), if near-term ambition is not strengthened beyond the level implied by current NDCs.
Accelerated and stronger short-term action and enhanced longer-term national ambition going beyond the NDCs would be needed 
for 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Implementing deeper emissions reductions than current NDCs would imply action towards levels 
identified in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3, either as part of or over-delivering on NDCs. 
5. The impact of uncertainties on NDC emission levels
The measures proposed in NDCs are not legally binding (Nemet et al., 2017), further impacting estimates of anticipated 2030 
emission levels. The aggregation of targets results in high uncertainty (Rogelj et al., 2017), which could be reduced with clearer 
guidelines for compiling future NDCs focused more on energy accounting (Rogelj et al., 2017) and increased transparency and 
comparability (Pauw et al., 2018). 
Many factors would influence NDCs global aggregated effects, including: (1) variations in socio-economic conditions (GDP and 
population growth), (2) uncertainties in historical emission inventories, (3) conditionality of certain NDCs, (4) definition of NDC 
targets as ranges instead of single values, (5) the way in which renewable energy targets are expressed, and (6) the way in which 
traditional biomass use is accounted for. Additionally, there are land-use mitigation uncertainties (Forsell et al., 2016; Grassi et al., 
2017). Land-use options play a key role in many country NDCs; however, many analyses on NDCs do not use country estimates on 
land-use emissions, but use model estimates, mainly because of the large difference in estimating the ‘anthropogenic’ forest sink 
between countries and models (Grassi et al., 2017). 
6. Comparing countries’ NDC ambition (equity, cost optimal allocation and other indicators)
Various assessment frameworks have been proposed to analyse, benchmark and compare NDCs, and indicate possible strengthening, 
based on equity and other indicators (Aldy et al., 2016; den Elzen et al., 2016; Höhne et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Holz et al., 
2018).There is large variation in conformity/fulfilment with equity principles across NDCs and countries. Studies use assessment 
frameworks based on six effort sharing categories in the AR5 (Clarke et al., 2014) with the principles of ‘responsibility’, ‘capability’ 
and ‘equity’ (Höhne et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Robiou du Pont et al., 2017). There is an important methodological gap in 
the assessment of the NDCs’ fairness and equity implications, partly due to lack of information on countries’ own assessments 
(Winkler et al., 2017). Implementation of Article 2.2 of the Paris Agreement could reflect equity and the principle of ‘common but 
differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’, due to different national circumstances and different interpretations of 
equity principles (Lahn and Sundqvist, 2017; Lahn, 2018).

Adaptation
The Paris Agreement recognizes adaptation by establishing a global goal for adaptation (Kato and Ellis, 2016; Rajamani, 2016; 
Kinley, 2017; Lesnikowski et al., 2017; UNEP, 2017a). This is assessed qualitatively, as achieving a temperature goal would determine 
the level of adaptation ambition required to deal with the consequent risks and impacts (Rajamani, 2016). Countries can include 
domestic adaptation goals in their NDCs, which together with national adaptation plans (NAPs) give countries flexibility to design 
and adjust their adaptation trajectories as their needs evolve and as progress is evaluated over time. A challenge for assessing 
progress on adaptation globally is the aggregation of many national adaptation actions and approaches. Knowledge gaps still 
remain about how to design measurement frameworks that generate and integrate national adaptation data without placing undue 
burdens on countries (UNEP, 2017a).
The Paris Agreement stipulates that adaptation communications shall be submitted as a component of or in conjunction with 
other communications, such as an NDC, a NAP, or a national communication. Of the 197 Parties to the UNFCCC, 140 NDCs have 
an adaptation component, almost exclusively from developing countries. NDC adaptation components could be an opportunity 
for enhancing adaptation planning and implementation by highlighting priorities and goals (Kato and Ellis, 2016). At the national 
level they provide momentum for the development of NAPs and raise the profile of adaptation (Pauw et al., 2016b, 2018). The Paris 
Agreement’s transparency framework includes adaptation, through which ‘adaptation communication’ and accelerated adaptation 
actions are submitted and reviewed every five years (Hermwille, 2016; Kato and Ellis, 2016). This framework, unlike others used in 
the past, is applicable to all countries taking into account differing capacities amongst Parties (Rajamani, 2016). 
Adaptation measures presented in qualitative terms include sectors, risks and vulnerabilities that are seen as priorities by the Parties. 
Sectoral coverage of adaptation actions identified in NDCs is uneven, with adaptation primarily reported to focus on the water 
sector (71% of NDCs with adaptation component), agriculture (63%), health (54%), and biodiversity/ecosystems (50%) (Pauw et 
al., 2016b, 2018).

4.4.2 
Enhancing Institutional Capacities
The implementation of sound responses and strategies to enable a 
transition to 1.5°C world would require strengthening governance 
and scaling up institutional capacities, particularly in developing 
countries (Adenle et al., 2017; Rosenbloom, 2017). Building on the 
characterization of governance in Section 4.4.1, this section examines 
the necessary institutional capacity to implement actions to limit 
warming to 1.5°C and adapt to the consequences. This takes into 
account a plurality of regional and local responses, as institutional 
capacity is highly context-dependent (North, 1990; Lustick et al., 
2011).  
Institutions would need to interact with one another and align across 
scales to ensure that rules and regulations are followed (Chaffin 
and Gunderson, 2016; Young, 2016). The institutional architecture 
required for a 1.5°C world would include the growing proportion of 
the world’s population that live in peri-urban and informal settlements 
and engage in informal economic activity (Simone and Pieterse, 2017). 
This population, amongst the most exposed to perturbed climates in 
the world (Hallegatte et al., 2017), is also beyond the direct reach 
of some policy instruments (Jaglin, 2014; Thieme, 2018). Strategies 
that accommodate the informal rules of the game adopted by these 
populations have large chances of success (McGranahan et al., 2016; 
Kaika, 2017).
The goal for strengthening implementation is to ensure that these rules 
and regulations embrace equity, equality and poverty alleviation along 
1.5°C-consistent pathways (mitigation) and enables the building of 
adaptive capacity that together, will enable sustainable development 
and poverty reduction.
Rising to the challenge of a transition to a 1.5°C world would require 
enhancing institutional climate change capacities along multiple 
dimensions presented below.
4.4.2.1 Capacity for policy design and implementation
The enhancement of institutional capacity for integrated policy design 
and implementation has long been among the top items on the UN 
agenda of addressing global environmental problems and sustainable 
development (see Chapter 5, Section 5.5) (UNEP, 2005). 
Political stability, an effective regulatory and enforcement framework 
(e.g., institutions to impose sanctions, collect taxes and to verify 
building codes), access to a knowledge base and the availability of 
resources, would be needed at various governance levels to address 
a wide range of stakeholders and their concerns. The strengthening 
of the global response would need to support these with different 
interventions, in the context of sustainable development (Chapter 5, 
Section 5.5.1) (Pasquini et al., 2015).
Given the scale of change needed to limit warming to 1.5°C, 
strengthening the response capacity of relevant institutions is best 
addressed in ways that take advantage of existing decision-making 
processes in local and regional governments and within cities and

communities (Romero-Lankao et al., 2013), and draws upon diverse 
knowledge sources including indigenous and local knowledge 
(Nakashima et al., 2012; Smith and Sharp, 2012; Mistry and Berardi, 
2016; Tschakert et al., 2017). Examples of successful local institutional 
processes and the integration of local knowledge in climate-related 
decision-making are provided in Box 4.3 and Box 4.4.
Implementing 1.5°C-consistent strategies would require well-
functioning legal frameworks to be in place, in conjunction with 
clearly defined mandates, rights and responsibilities to enable the 
institutional capacity to deliver (Romero-Lankao et al., 2013). As 
an example, current rates of urbanization occurring in cities with a 
lack of institutional capacity for effective land-use planning, zoning 
and infrastructure development result in unplanned, informal urban 
settlements which are vulnerable to climate impacts. It is common 
for 30–50% of urban populations in low-income nations to live in 
informal settlements with no regulatory infrastructure (Revi et al., 
2014b). For example, in Huambo (Angola), a classified ‘urban’ area 
extends 20 km west of the city and is predominantly made up of 
‘unplanned’ urban settlements (Smith and Jenkins, 2015). 
Internationally, the Paris Agreement process has aimed at enhancing 
the capacity of decision-making institutions in developing countries 
to support effective implementation. These efforts are particularly 
reflected in Article 11 of the Paris Agreement on capacity building 
(the creation of the Paris Committee on Capacity Building), Article 13 
(the creation of the Capacity Building Initiative on Transparency), and 
Article 15 on compliance (UNFCCC, 2016).
Box 4.3 |  Indigenous Knowledge and Community Adaptation
Indigenous knowledge refers to the understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long histories of interaction 
with their natural surroundings (UNESCO, 2017). This knowledge can underpin the development of adaptation and mitigation 
strategies (Ford et al., 2014b; Green and Minchin, 2014; Pearce et al., 2015; Savo et al., 2016). 
Climate change is an important concern for the Maya, who depend on climate knowledge for their livelihood. In Guatemala, the 
collaboration between the Mayan K’iché population of the Nahualate river basin and the Climate Change Institute has resulted in 
a catalogue of indigenous knowledge, used to identify indicators for watershed meteorological forecasts (López and Álvarez, 2016). 
These indicators are relevant but would need continuous assessment if their continued reliability is to be confirmed (Nyong et al., 
2007; Alexander et al., 2011; Mistry and Berardi, 2016). For more than ten years, Guatemala has maintained an ‘Indigenous Table 
for Climate Change’, to enable the consideration of indigenous knowledge in disaster management and adaptation development. 
In Tanzania, increased variability of rainfall is challenging indigenous and local communities (Mahoo et al., 2015; Sewando et 
al., 2016). The majority of agro-pastoralists use indigenous knowledge to forecast seasonal rainfall, relying on observations of 
plant phenology, bird, animal, and insect behaviour, the sun and moon, and wind (Chang’a et al., 2010; Elia et al., 2014; Shaffer, 
2014). Increased climate variability has raised concerns about the reliability of these indicators (Shaffer, 2014); therefore, initiatives 
have focused on the co-production of knowledge by involving local communities in monitoring and discussing the implications of 
indigenous knowledge and meteorological forecasts (Shaffer, 2014), and creating local forecasts by utilizing the two sources of 
knowledge (Mahoo et al., 2013). This has resulted in increased documentation of indigenous knowledge, understanding of relevant 
climate information amongst stakeholders, and adaptive capacity at the community level (Mahoo et al., 2013, 2015; Shaffer, 2014). 
The Pacific Islands and small island developing states (SIDS) are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, but the cultural resilience 
of Pacific Island inhabitants is also recognized (Nunn et al., 2017). In Fiji and Vanuatu, strategies used to prepare for cyclones include 
building reserve emergency supplies and utilizing farming techniques to ensure adequate crop yield to combat potential losses 
from a cyclone or drought (McNamara and Prasad, 2014; Granderson, 2017; Pearce et al., 2017). Social cohesion and kinship are 
important in responding and preparing for climate-related hazards, including the role of resource sharing, communal labour, and 
remittances (McMillen et al., 2014; Gawith et al., 2016; Granderson, 2017). There is a concern that indigenous knowledge will 
weaken, a process driven by westernization and disruptions in established bioclimatic indicators and traditional planning calendars 
(Granderson, 2017). In some urban settlements, it has been noted that cultural practices (e.g., prioritizing the quantity of food over 
the quality of food) can lower food security through dispersing limited resources and by encouraging the consumption of cheap 
but nutrient-poor foods (Mccubbin et al., 2017) (See Cross-Chapter Box 6 on Food Security in Chapter 3). Indigenous practices also 
encounter limitations, particularly in relation to sea level rise (Nunn et al., 2017).

Box 4.4 |  Manizales, Colombia: Supportive National Government and Localized Planning and Integration 
 
   as an Enabling Condition for Managing Climate and Development Risks
Institutional reform in the city of Manizales, Colombia, helps identify three important features of an enabling environment: 
integrating climate change adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk management at the city-scale; the importance of decentralized 
planning and policy formulation within a supportive national policy environment; and the role of a multi-sectoral framework in 
mainstreaming climate action in development activities. 
Manizales is exposed to risks caused by rapid development and expansion in a mountainous terrain exposed to seismic activity and 
periodic wet and dry spells. Local assessments expect climate change to amplify the risk of disasters (Carreño et al., 2017). The city 
is widely recognized for its longstanding urban environmental policy (Biomanizales) and local environmental action plan (Bioplan), 
and has been integrating environmental planning in its development agenda for nearly two decades (Velásquez Barrero, 1998; 
Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2014). When the city’s environmental agenda was updated in 2014 to reflect climate change risks, 
assessments were conducted in a participatory manner at the street and neighbourhood level (Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2016). 
The creation of a new Environmental Secretariat assisted in coordination and integration of environmental policies, disaster risk 
management, development and climate change (Leck and Roberts, 2015). Planning in Manizales remains mindful of steep gradients 
through its longstanding Slope Guardian programme that trains women and keeps records of vulnerable households. Planning also 
looks to include mitigation opportunities and enhance local capacity through participatory engagement (Hardoy and Velásquez 
Barrero, 2016). 
Manizales’ mayors were identified as important champions for much of these early integration and innovation efforts. Their 
role may have been enabled by Colombia’s history of decentralized approaches to planning and policy formulation, including 
establishing environmental observatories (for continuous environmental assessment) and participatory tracking of environmental 
indicators. Multi-stakeholder involvement has both enabled and driven progress, and has enabled the integration of climate risks in 
development planning (Hardoy and Velásquez Barrero, 2016). 
4.4.2.2 Monitoring, reporting, and review institutions
One of the novel features of the new climate governance architecture 
emerging from the 2015 Paris Agreement is the transparency 
framework in Article 13 committing countries, based on capacity, 
to provide regular progress reports on national pledges to address 
climate change (UNFCCC, 2016). Many countries will rely on public 
policies and existing national reporting channels to deliver on their 
NDCs under the Paris Agreement. Scaling up the mitigation and 
adaptation efforts in these countries to be consistent with 1.5°C 
would put significant pressure on the need to develop, enhance and 
streamline local, national and international climate change reporting 
and monitoring methodologies and institutional capacity in relation 
to mitigation, adaptation, finance, and GHG inventories (Ford et al., 
2015b; Lesnikowski et al., 2015; Schoenefeld et al., 2016). Consistent 
with this direction, the provision of the information to the stocktake 
under Article 14 of the Paris Agreement would contribute to enhancing 
reporting and transparency (UNFCCC, 2016). Nonetheless, approaches, 
reporting procedures, reference points, and data sources to assess 
progress on implementation across and within nations are still largely 
underdeveloped (Ford et al., 2015b; Araos et al., 2016b; Magnan and 
Ribera, 2016; Lesnikowski et al., 2017). The availability of independent 
private and public reporting and statistical institutions are integral to 
oversight, effective monitoring, reporting and review. The creation and 
enhancement of these institutions would be an important contribution 
to an effective transition to a low-emission world.
4.4.2.3 Financial institutions
IPCC AR5 assessed that in order to enable a transition to a 2°C pathway, 
the volume of climate investments would need to be transformed along 
with changes in the pattern of general investment behaviour towards 
low emissions. The report argued that, compared to 2012, annually up 
to a trillion dollars in additional investment in low-emission energy and 
energy efficiency measures may be required until 2050 (Blanco et al., 
2014; IEA, 2014a). Financing of 1.5°C would present an even greater 
challenge, addressing financing of both existing and new assets, which 
would require significant transitions to the type and structure of financial 
institutions as well as to the method of financing (Cochrani et al., 2014; 
Ma, 2014). Both public and private financial institutions would be needed 
to contribute to the large resource mobilization needed for 1.5°C, yet, in 
the ordinary course of business, these transitions may not be expected. 
On the one hand, private financial institutions could face scale-up risk, 
for example, the risks associated with commercialization and scaling 
up of renewable technologies to accelerate mitigation (Wilson, 2012; 
Hartley and Medlock, 2013) and/or price risk, such as carbon price 
volatility that carbon markets could face. In contrast, traditional public 
financial institutions are limited by both structure and instruments, while 
concessional financing would require taxpayer support for subsidization. 
Special efforts and innovative approaches would be needed to address 
these challenges, for example the creation of special institutions that 
underwrite the value of emission reductions using auctioned price floors 
(Bodnar et al., 2018) to deal with price volatility.

Financial institutions are equally important for adaptation. 
Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler (2015) discussed the 
benefits of financial instruments in adaptation, including the 
provision of post-disaster finances for recovery and pre-disaster 
security necessary for climate adaptation and poverty reduction. 
Pre-disaster financial instruments and options include insurance, 
such as index-based weather insurance schemes, catastrophe bonds, 
and laws to encourage insurance purchasing. The development and 
enhancement of microfinance institutions to ensure social resilience 
and smooth transitions in the adaptation to climate change impacts 
could be an important local institutional innovation (Hammill et al., 
2008). 
4.4.2.4 Co-operative institutions and social safety nets
Effective cooperative institutions and social safety nets may help 
address energy access and adaptation, as well as distributional impacts 
during the transition to 1.5°C-consistent pathways and enabling 
sustainable development. Not all countries have the institutional 
capabilities to design and manage these. Social capital for adaptation 
in the form of bonding, bridging, and linking social institutions has 
proved to be effective in dealing with climate crises at the local, 
regional and national levels (Aldrich et al., 2016).
The shift towards sustainable energy systems in transitioning 
economies could impact the livelihoods of large populations in 
traditional and legacy employment sectors. The transition of selected 
EU Member States to biofuels, for example, caused anxiety among 
farmers, who lacked confidence in the biofuel crop market. Enabling 
contracts between farmers and energy companies, involving local 
governments, helped create an atmosphere of confidence during the 
transition (McCormick and Kåberger, 2007).
How do broader socio-economic processes influence urban 
vulnerabilities and thereby underpin climate change adaptation? 
This is a systemic challenge originating from a lack of collective 
societal ownership of the responsibility for climate risk management. 
Explanations for this situation include competing time-horizons due 
to self-interest of stakeholders to a more ‘rational’ conception of risk 
assessment, measured across a risk-tolerance spectrum (Moffatt, 2014).
Self-governing and self-organ¬ised institutional settings, where 
equipment and resource systems are commonly owned and managed, 
can poten¬tially generate a much higher diversity of administration 
solutions, than other institutional arrangements, where energy 
technology and resource systems are either owned and administered 
individually in market settings or via a central authority (e.g., the 
state). They can also increase the adaptability of technological systems 
while reducing their burden on the environment (Labanca, 2017). 
Educational, learning and awareness-building institutions can help 
strengthen the societal response to climate change (Butler et al., 2016; 
Thi Hong Phuong et al., 2017).
4.4.3 
Enabling Lifestyle and Behavioural Change
Humans are at the centre of global climate change: their actions cause 
anthropogenic climate change, and social change is key to effectively 
responding to climate change (Vlek and Steg, 2007; Dietz et al., 2013; 
ISSC and UNESCO, 2013; Hackmann et al., 2014). Chapter 2 shows 
that 1.5°C-consistent pathways assume substantial changes in 
behaviour. This section assesses the potential of behaviour change, as 
the integrated assessment models (IAMs) applied in Chapter 2 do not 
comprehensively asses this potential. 
Table 4.8 shows examples of mitigation and adaption actions relevant 
for 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Reductions in population growth can 
reduce overall carbon demand and mitigate climate change (Bridgeman, 
2017), particularly when population growth is accompanied by increases 
in affluence and carbon-intensive consumption (Rosa and Dietz, 2012; 
Clayton et al., 2017). Mitigation actions with a substantial carbon 
emission reduction potential (see Figure 4.3) that individuals may 
readily adopt would have the most climate impact (Dietz et al., 2009).
Various policy approaches and strategies can encourage and enable 
climate actions by individuals and organizations. Policy approaches 
would be more effective when they address key contextual and psycho-

social factors influencing climate actions, which differ across contexts 
and individuals (Steg and Vlek, 2009; Stern, 2011). This suggests 
that diverse policy approaches would be needed in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways in different contexts and regions. Combinations of policies 
that target multiple barriers and enabling factors simultaneously can 
be more effective (Nissinen et al., 2015).
In the United States and Europe, GHG emissions are lower when 
legislators have strong environmental records (Jensen and Spoon, 2011; 
Dietz et al., 2015). Political elites affect public concern about climate 
change: pro-climate action statements increased concern, while anti-
climate action statements and anti-environment voting reduced public 
concern about climate change (Brulle et al., 2012). In the European 
364
Chapter 4

Union (EU), individuals worry more about climate change and engage 
more in climate actions in countries where political party elites are 
united rather than divided in their support for environmental issues 
(Sohlberg, 2017).
This section discusses how to enable and encourage behaviour and 
lifestyle changes that strengthen implementation of 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways by assessing psycho-social factors related to climate action, 
as well as the effects and acceptability of policy approaches targeting 
climate actions that are consistent with 1.5°C. Box 4.5 and Box 4.6 
illustrate how these have worked in practice. 
4.4.3.1 Factors related to climate actions
Mitigation and adaptation behaviour is affected by many factors that 
shape which options are feasible and considered by individuals. Besides 
contextual factors (see other sub-sections in Section 4.4), these include 
abilities and different types of motivation to engage in behaviour. 
Ability to engage in climate action. Individuals more often engage 
in adaptation (Gebrehiwot and van der Veen, 2015; Koerth et al., 
2017) and mitigation behaviour (Pisano and Lubell, 2017) when they 
are or feel more capable to do so. Hence, it is important to enhance 
ability to act on climate change, which depends on income and 
knowledge, among other things. A higher income is related to higher 
CO2 emissions; higher income groups can afford more carbon-intensive 
lifestyles (Lamb et al., 2014; Dietz et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Yet 
low-income groups may lack resources to invest in energy-efficient 
technology and refurbishments (Andrews-Speed and Ma, 2016) and 
adaptation options (Wamsler, 2007; Fleming et al., 2015b; Takahashi et 
al., 2016). Adaptive capacity further depends on gender roles (Jabeen, 
2014; Bunce and Ford, 2015), technical capacities and knowledge 
(Feola et al., 2015; Eakin et al., 2016; Singh et al., 2016b).
Knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change and 
of ways to reduce GHG emissions is not always accurate (Bord et al., 
2000; Whitmarsh et al., 2011; Tobler et al., 2012), which can inhibit 
climate actions, even when people would be motivated to act. For 
example, people overestimate savings from low-energy activities, 
and underestimate savings from high-energy activities (Attari et al., 
2010). They know little about ‘embodied’ energy (i.e., energy needed 
to produce products; Tobler et al., 2011), including meat (de Boer et 
al., 2016b). Some people mistake weather for climate (Reynolds et al., 
2010), or conflate climate risks with other hazards, which can inhibit 
adequate adaptation (Taylor et al., 2014). 
More knowledge on adaptation is related to higher engagement in 
adaptation actions in some circumstances (Bates et al., 2009; van 
Kasteren, 2014; Hagen et al., 2016). How adaptation is framed in 
the media can influence the types of options viewed as important in 
different contexts (Boykoff et al., 2013; Moser, 2014; Ford and King, 
2015). 
Knowledge is important, but is often not sufficient to motivate action 
(Trenberth et al., 2016). Climate change knowledge and perceptions 
are not strongly related to mitigation actions (Hornsey et al., 2016). 
Direct experience of events related to climate change influences 
climate concerns and actions (Blennow et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2014), 
more so than second-hand information (Spence et al., 2011; Myers et 
al., 2012; Demski et al., 2017); high impact events with low frequency 
are remembered more than low impact regular events (Meze-Hausken, 
2004; Singh et al., 2016b; Sullivan-Wiley and Short Gianotti, 2017). 
Personal experience with climate hazards strengthens motivation to 
protect oneself (Jabeen, 2014) and enhances adaptation actions (Bryan 
et al., 2009; Berrang-Ford et al., 2011; Demski et al., 2017), although 
this does not always translate into proactive adaptation (Taylor et 
al., 2014). Collectively constructed notions of risk and expectations 
of future climate variability shape risk perception and adaptation 
behaviour (Singh et al., 2016b). People with particular political views 
and those who emphasize individual autonomy may reject climate 
science knowledge and believe that there is widespread scientific 
disagreement about climate change (Kahan, 2010; O’Neill et al., 2013), 
inhibiting support for climate policy (Ding et al., 2011; McCright et al., 
2013). This may explain why extreme weather experiences enhances 
preparedness to reduce energy use among left- but not right-leaning 
voters (Ogunbode et al., 2017). 
Motivation to engage in climate action. Climate actions are 
more strongly related to motivational factors than to knowledge, 
reflecting individuals’ reasons for actions, such as values, ideology 
and worldviews (Hornsey et al., 2016). People consider various types 
of costs and benefits of actions (Gölz and Hahnel, 2016) and focus 
on consequences that have implications for the values they find most 
important (Dietz et al., 2013; Hahnel et al., 2015; Steg, 2016). This 
implies that different individuals consider different consequences when 
making choices. People who strongly value protecting the environment 
and other people generally more strongly consider climate impacts and 
act more on climate change than those who strongly endorse hedonic 
and egoistic values (Taylor et al., 2014; Steg, 2016). People are more 
prone to adopt sustainable innovations when they are more open to 
new ideas (Jansson, 2011; Wolske et al., 2017). Further, a free-market 
ideology is associated with weaker climate change beliefs (McCright 
and Dunlap, 2011; Hornsey et al., 2016), and a capital-oriented culture 
tends to promote activity associated with GHG emissions (Kasser et 
al., 2007). 
Some indigenous populations believe it is arrogant to predict the 
future, and some cultures have belief systems that interpret natural 
phenomena as sentient, where thoughts and words are believed to 
influence the future, with people reluctant to talk about negative future 
possibilities (Natcher et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2018). Integrating these 
considerations into the design of adaptation and mitigation policy is 
important (Cochran et al., 2013; Chapin et al., 2016; Brugnach et al., 
2017; Flynn et al., 2018).
People are more prone to act on climate change when individual benefits 
of actions exceed costs (Steg and Vlek, 2009; Kardooni et al., 2016; 
Wolske et al., 2017). For this reason, people generally prefer adoption of 
energy-efficient appliances above energy-consumption reductions; the 
latter is perceived as more costly (Poortinga et al., 2003; Steg et al., 
2006), although transaction costs can inhibit the uptake of mitigation 
technology (Mundaca, 2007). Decentralized renewable energy systems 
are evaluated most favourably when they guarantee independence, 
autonomy, control and supply security (Ecker et al., 2017).

Chapter 4
Besides, social costs and benefits affect climate action (Farrow et al., 
2017). People engage more in climate actions when they think others 
expect them to do so and when others act as well (Nolan et al., 2008; 
Le Dang et al., 2014; Truelove et al., 2015; Rai et al., 2016), and when 
they experience social support (Singh et al., 2016a; Burnham and Ma, 
2017; Wolske et al., 2017). Discussing effective actions with peers also 
encourages climate action (Esham and Garforth, 2013), particularly 
when individuals strongly identify with their peers (Biddau et al., 
2012; Fielding and Hornsey, 2016). Further, individuals may engage 
in mitigation actions when they think doing so would enhance their 
reputation (Milinski et al., 2006; Noppers et al., 2014; Kastner and 
Stern, 2015). Such social costs and benefits can be addressed in climate 
policy (see Section 4.4.3.2).
Feelings affect climate action (Brosch et al., 2014). Negative feelings 
related to climate change can encourage adaptation action (Kerstholt 
et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017), while positive feelings associated with 
climate risks may inhibit protective behaviour (Lefevre et al., 2015). 
Individuals are more prone to engage in mitigation actions when they 
worry about climate change (Verplanken and Roy, 2013) and when 
they expect to derive positive feelings from such actions (Pelletier et 
al., 1998; Taufik et al., 2016).
Furthermore, collective consequences affect climate actions 
(Balcombe et al., 2013; Dóci and Vasileiadou, 2015; Kastner and 
Stern, 2015). People are motivated to see themselves as morally 
right, which encourages mitigation actions (Steg et al., 2015), 
particularly when long-term goals are salient (Zaval et al., 2015) and 
behavioural costs are not too high (Diekmann and Preisendörfer, 
2003). Individuals are more prone to engage in climate actions when 
they believe climate change is occurring, when they are aware of 
threats caused by climate change and by their inaction, and when 
they think they can engage in actions that will reduce these threats 
(Esham and Garforth, 2013; Arunrat et al., 2017; Chatrchyan et al., 
2017). The more individuals are concerned about climate change and 
aware of the negative climate impact of their behaviour, the more 
they feel responsible for their actions and think that their actions can 
help reduce such negative impacts, which can strengthen their moral 
norms to act accordingly (Steg and de Groot, 2010; Jakovcevic and 
Steg, 2013; Chen, 2015; Ray et al., 2017; Wolske et al., 2017; Woods 
et al., 2017). Individuals may engage in mitigation actions when 
they see themselves as supportive of the environment (i.e., strong 
environmental self-identity) (Fielding et al., 2008; van der Werff et 
al., 2013b; Kashima et al., 2014; Barbarossa et al., 2017); a strong 
environmental identity strengthens intrinsic motivation to engage 
in mitigation actions both at home (van der Werff et al., 2013a) 
and at work (Ruepert et al., 2016). Environmental self-identity is 
strengthened when people realize they have engaged in mitigation 
actions, which can in turn promote further mitigation actions (van der 
Werff et al., 2014b).
Individuals are less prone to engage in adaptation behaviour 
themselves when they rely on external measures such as government 
interventions (Grothmann and Reusswig, 2006; Wamsler and Brink, 
2014a; Armah et al., 2015; Burnham and Ma, 2017) or perceive 
themselves as protected by god (Gandure et al., 2013; Dang et al., 
2014; Cannon, 2015). 
Habits, heuristics and biases. Decisions are often not based on 
weighing costs and benefits, but on habit or automaticity, both of 
individuals (Aarts and Dijksterhuis, 2000; Kloeckner et al., 2003) 
and within organizations (Dooley, 2017) and institutions (Munck 
et al., 2014). When habits are strong, individuals are less perceptive 
of information (Verplanken et al., 1997; Aarts et al., 1998) and may 
not consider alternatives as long as outcomes are good enough 
(Maréchal, 2010). Habits are mostly only reconsidered when the 
situation changed significantly (Fujii and Kitamura, 2003; Maréchal, 
2010; Verplanken and Roy, 2016). Hence, strategies that create the 
opportunity for reflection and encourage active decisions can break 
habits (Steg et al., 2018).
Individuals can follow heuristics, or ‘rules of thumb’, in making 
inferences, which demand less cognitive resources, knowledge 
and time than thinking through all implications of actions (Preston 
et al., 2013; Frederiks et al., 2015; Gillingham and Palmer, 2017). 
For example, people tend to think that larger and more visible 
appliances use more energy, which is not always accurate (Cowen 
and Gatersleben, 2017). They underestimate energy used for water 
heating and overestimate energy used for lighting (Stern, 2014). 
When facing choice overload, people may choose the easiest or first 
available option, which can inhibit energy-saving behaviour (Stern 
and Gardner, 1981; Frederiks et al., 2015). As a result, individuals 
and firms often strive for satisficing (‘good enough’) outcomes with 
regard to energy decisions (Wilson and Dowlatabadi, 2007; Klotz, 
2011), which can inhibit investments in energy efficiency (Decanio, 
1993; Frederiks et al., 2015).
Biases also play a role. In Mozambique, farmers displayed omission 
biases (unwillingness to take adaptation actions with potentially 
negative consequences to avoid personal responsibility for losses), 
while policymakers displayed action biases (wanting to demonstrate 
positive action despite potential negative consequences; Patt and 
Schröter, 2008). People tend to place greater value on relative losses 
than gains (Kahneman, 2003). Perceived gains and losses depend on 
the reference point or status-quo (Kahneman, 2003). Loss aversion 
and the status-quo bias prevent consumers from switching electricity 
suppliers (Ek and Söderholm, 2008), to time-of-use electricity tariffs 
(Nicolson et al., 2017), and to accept new energy systems (Leijten et 
al., 2014).
Owned inefficient appliances and fossil fuel-based electricity can act as 
endowments, increasing their value compared to alternatives (Pichert 
and Katsikopoulos, 2008; Dinner et al., 2011). Uncertainty and loss 
aversion lead consumers to undervalue future energy savings (Greene, 
2011) and savings from energy efficient technologies (Kolstad et al., 
2014). Uncertainties about the performance of products and illiquidity 
of investments can drive consumers to postpone (profitable) energy-
efficient investments (Sutherland, 1991; van Soest and Bulte, 2001). 
People with a higher tendency to delay decisions may engage less 
in energy saving actions (Lillemo, 2014). Training energy auditors in 
loss-aversion increased their clients’ investments in energy efficiency 
improvements (Gonzales et al., 1988). Engagement in energy saving 
and renewable energy programmes can be enhanced if participation is 
set as a default option (Pichert and Katsikopoulos, 2008; Ölander and 
Thøgersen, 2014; Ebeling and Lotz, 2015).

4.4.3.2 Strategies and policies to promote actions 
on climate change
Policy can enable and strengthen motivation to act on climate change 
via top-down or bottom-up approaches, through informational 
campaigns, regulatory measures, financial (dis)incentives, and 
infrastructural and technological changes (Adger et al., 2003; Steg and 
Vlek, 2009; Henstra, 2016). 
Adaptation efforts tend to focus on infrastructural and technological 
solutions (Ford and King, 2015) with lower emphasis on socio-cognitive 
and finance aspects of adaptation. For example, flooding policies in 
cities focus on infrastructure projects and regulation such as building 
codes, and hardly target individual or household behaviour (Araos et 
al., 2016b; Georgeson et al., 2016). 
Current mitigation policies emphasize infrastructural and technology 
development, regulation, financial incentives and information 
provision (Mundaca and Markandya, 2016) that can create conditions 
enabling climate action, but target only some of the many factors 
influencing climate actions (see Section 4.4.5.1). They fall short of 
their true potential if their social and psychological implications are 
overlooked (Stern et al., 2016a). For example, promising energy-
saving or low-carbon technology may not be adopted or not be used 
as intended (Pritoni et al., 2015) when people lack resources and 
trustworthy information (Stern, 2011; Balcombe et al., 2013). 
Financial incentives or feedback on financial savings can encourage 
climate action (Santos, 2008; Bolderdijk et al., 2011; Maki et al., 
2016) (see Box 4.5), but are not always effective (Delmas et al., 
2013) and can be less effective than social rewards (Handgraaf et 
al., 2013) or emphasising benefits for people and the environment 
(Bolderdijk et al., 2013b; Asensio and Delmas, 2015; Schwartz et 
al., 2015). The latter can happen when financial incentives reduce 
a focus on environmental considerations and weaken intrinsic 
motivation to engage in climate action (Evans et al., 2012; Agrawal 
et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2015). In addition, pursuing small 
financial gains is perceived to be less worth the effort than pursuing 
equivalent CO2 emission reductions (Bolderdijk et al., 2013b; Dogan 
et al., 2014). Also, people may not respond to financial incentives 
(e.g., to improve energy efficiency) because they do not trust the 
organization sponsoring incentive programmes (Mundaca, 2007) or 
when it takes too much effort to receive the incentive (Stern et al., 
2016a). 
Box 4.5 |  How Pricing Policy has Reduced Car Use in Singapore, Stockholm and London
In Singapore, Stockholm and London, car ownership, car use, and GHG emissions have reduced because of pricing and regulatory 
policies and policies facilitating behaviour change. Notably, acceptability of these policies has increased as people experienced their 
positive effects.
Singapore implemented electronic road pricing in the central business district and at major expressways, a vehicle quota and 
registration fee system, and investments in mass transit. In the vehicle quota system introduced in 1990, registration of new vehicles 
is conditional upon a successful bid (via auctioning) (Chu, 2015), costing about 50,000 USD in 2014 (LTA, 2015). The registration 
tax incentivizes purchases of low-emission vehicles via a feebate system. As a result, per capita transport emissions (approximately 
1.25 tCO2yr−1) and car ownership (107 vehicles per 1000 capita) (LTA, 2017) are substantially lower than in cities with comparable 
income levels. Modal share of public transport was 63% during peak hours in 2013 (LTA, 2013).
The Stockholm congestion charge implemented in 2007 (after a trial in 2006) reduced kilometres driven in the inner city by 16%, and 
outside the city by 5%; traffic volumes reduced by 20% and remained constant over time despite economic and population growth 
(Eliasson, 2014). CO2 emissions from traffic reduced by 2–3% in Stockholm county. Vehicles entering or leaving the city centre 
were charged during weekdays (except for holidays). Charges were 1–2€ (maximum 6€ per day), being higher during peak hours; 
taxis, emergency vehicles and buses were exempted. Before introducing the charge, public transport and parking places near mass 
transit stations were extended. The aim and effects of the charge were extensively communicated to the public. Acceptability of the 
congestion charge was initially low, but the scheme gained support of about two-thirds of the population and all political parties 
after it was implemented (Eliasson, 2014), which may be related to the fact that the revenues were earmarked for constructing 
a motorway tunnel. After the trial, people believed that the charge had more positive effects on environmental, congestion and 
parking problems while costs increased less than they anticipated beforehand (Schuitema et al., 2010a). The initially hostile media 
eventually declared the scheme to be a success. 
In 2003, a congestion charge was implemented in the Greater London area, with an enforcement and compliance scheme and an 
information campaign on the functioning of the scheme. Vehicles entering, leaving, driving or parking on a public road in the zone 
at weekdays at daytime pay a congestion charge of 8£ (until 2005, 5£), with some exemptions. Revenues were invested in London’s 
bus network (80%), cycling facilities, and road safety measures (Leape, 2006). The number of cars entering the zone decreased by 
18% in 2003 and 2004. In the charging zone, vehicle kilometres driven decreased by 15% in the first year and a further 6% a year 
later, while CO2 emissions from road traffic reduced by 20% (Santos, 2008).

While providing information on the causes and consequences of climate 
change or on effective climate actions generally increases knowledge, 
it often does not encourage engagement in climate actions by 
individuals (Abrahamse et al., 2005; Ünal et al., 2017) or organizations 
(Anderson and Newell, 2004). Similarly, media coverage on the UN 
Climate Summit slightly increased knowledge about the conference 
but did not enhance motivation to engage personally in climate 
protection (Brüggemann et al., 2017). Fear-inducing representations of 
climate change may inhibit action when they make people feel helpless 
and overwhelmed (O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009). Energy-related 
recommendations and feedback (e.g., via performance contracts, 
energy audits, smart metering) are more effective for promoting energy 
conservation, load shifting in electricity use and sustainable travel 
choices when framed in terms of losses rather than gains (Gonzales et 
al., 1988; Wolak, 2011; Bradley et al., 2016; Bager and Mundaca, 2017). 
Credible and targeted information at the point of decision can promote 
climate action (Stern et al., 2016a). For example, communicating the 
impacts of climate change is more effective when provided right 
before adaptation decisions are taken (e.g., before the agricultural 
season) and when bundled with information on potential actions to 
ameliorate impacts, rather than just providing information on climate 
projections with little meaning to end users (e.g., weather forecasts, 
seasonal forecasts, decadal climate trends) (Dorward et al., 2015; 
Singh et al., 2017). Similarly, heat action plans that provide early alerts 
and advisories combined with emergency public health measures can 
reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality (Benmarhnia et al., 2016). 
Information provision is more effective when tailored to the personal 
situation of individuals, demonstrating clear impacts, and resonating 
with individuals’ core values (Daamen et al., 2001; Abrahamse et al., 
2007; Bolderdijk et al., 2013a; Dorward et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2017). 
Tailored information prevents information overload, and people are 
more motivated to consider and act upon information that aligns with 
their core values and beliefs (Campbell and Kay, 2014; Hornsey et al., 
2016). Also, tailored information can remove barriers to receive and 
interpret information faced by vulnerable groups, such as the elderly 
during heatwaves (Vandentorren et al., 2006; Keim, 2008). Further, 
prompts can be effective when they serve as reminders to perform a 
planned action (Osbaldiston and Schott, 2012).
Feedback provision is generally effective in promoting mitigation 
behaviour within households (Abrahamse et al., 2005; Delmas et al., 
2013; Karlin et al., 2015) and at work (Young et al., 2015), particularly 
when provided in real-time or immediately after the action (Abrahamse 
et al., 2005), which makes the implications of one’s behaviour more 
salient (Tiefenbeck et al., 2016). Simple information is more effective 
than detailed and technical data (Wilson and Dowlatabadi, 2007; Ek 
and Söderholm, 2010; Frederiks et al., 2015). Energy labels (Banerjee 
and Solomon, 2003; Stadelmann, 2017), visualization techniques (Pahl 
et al., 2016), and ambient persuasive technology (Midden and Ham, 
2012) can encourage mitigation actions by providing information 
and feedback in a format that immediately makes sense and hardly 
requires users’ conscious attention. 
Social influence approaches that emphasize what other people do or 
think can encourage climate action (Clayton et al., 2015), particularly 
when they involve face-to-face interaction (Abrahamse and Steg, 2013). 
For example, community approaches, where change is initiated from 
the bottom-up, can promote adaptation (see Box 4.6) and mitigation 
actions (Middlemiss, 2011; Seyfang and Haxeltine, 2012; Abrahamse 
and Steg, 2013), especially when community ties are strong (Weenig 
and Midden, 1991). Furthermore, providing social models of desired 
actions can encourage mitigation action (Osbaldiston and Schott, 
2012; Abrahamse and Steg, 2013). Social influence approaches that do 
not involve social interaction, such as social norm, social comparison 
and group feedback, are less effective, but can be easily administered 
on a large scale at low costs (Allcott, 2011; Abrahamse and Steg, 2013). 
Goal setting can promote mitigation action when goals are not set 
too low or too high (Loock et al., 2013). Commitment strategies where 
people make a pledge to engage in climate actions can encourage 
mitigation behaviour (Abrahamse and Steg, 2013; Lokhorst et al., 2013), 
particularly when individuals also indicate how and when they will 
perform the relevant action and anticipate how to cope with possible 
barriers (i.e., implementation intentions) (Bamberg, 2000, 2002). Such 
strategies take advantage of individuals’ desire to be consistent (Steg, 
2016). Similarly, hypocrisy-related strategies that make people aware of 
inconsistencies between their attitudes and behaviour can encourage 
mitigation actions (Osbaldiston and Schott, 2012). 
Actions that reduce climate risks can be rewarded and facilitated, while 
actions that increase climate risks can be punished and inhibited, and 
behaviour change can be voluntary (e.g., information provision) or 
imposed (e.g., by law); voluntary changes that involve rewards are 
more acceptable than imposed changes that restrict choices (Eriksson 
et al., 2006, 2008; Steg et al., 2006; Dietz et al., 2007). Policies punishing 
maladaptive behaviour can increase vulnerability when they reinforce 
socio-economic inequalities that typically produce the maladaptive 
behaviour in the first place (Adger et al., 2003). Change can be initiated 
by governments at various levels, but also by individuals, communities, 
profit-making organizations, trade organizations, and other non-
governmental actors (Lindenberg and Steg, 2013; Robertson and 
Barling, 2015; Stern et al., 2016b). 
Strategies can target intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation. It may be 
particularly important to enhance intrinsic motivation so that people 
voluntarily engage in climate action over and again (Steg, 2016). 
Endorsement of mitigation and adaptation actions are positively 
related (Brügger et al., 2015; Carrico et al., 2015); both are positively 
related to concern about climate change (Brügger et al., 2015). 
Strategies that target general antecedents that affect a wide range 
of actions, such as values, identities, worldviews, climate change 
beliefs, awareness of the climate impacts of one’s actions, and feelings 
of responsibility to act on climate change, can encourage consistent 
actions on climate change (van Der Werff and Steg, 2015; Hornsey 
et al., 2016; Steg, 2016). Initial climate actions can lead to further 
commitment to climate action (Juhl et al., 2017), when people learn 
that such actions are easy and effective (Lauren et al., 2016), when they 
engaged in the initial behaviour for environmental reasons (Peters et 
al., 2018), hold strong pro-environmental values and norms (Thøgersen 
and Ölander, 2003), and when initial actions make them realise they 
are an environmentally sensitive person, motivating them to act on 
climate change in subsequent situations so as to be consistent (van der

Werff et al., 2014a; Lacasse, 2015, 2016). Yet some studies suggest that 
people may feel licensed not to engage in further mitigation actions 
when they believe they have already done their part (Truelove et al., 
2014).
4.4.3.3 Acceptability of policy and system changes
Public acceptability can shape, enable or prevent policy and system 
changes. Acceptability reflects the extent to which policy or system 
changes are evaluated (un)favourably. Acceptability is higher when 
people expect more positive and less negative effects of policy 
and system changes (Perlaviciute and Steg, 2014; Demski et al., 
2015; Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016), including climate impacts 
(Schuitema et al., 2010b). Because of this, policy ‘rewarding’ 
climate actions is more acceptable than policy ‘punishing’ actions 
that increase climate risks (Steg et al., 2006; Eriksson et al., 2008). 
Pricing policy is more acceptable when revenues are earmarked for 
environmental purposes (Steg et al., 2006; Sælen and Kallbekken, 
2011) or redistributed towards those affected (Schuitema and Steg, 
2008). Acceptability can increase when people experience positive 
effects after a policy has been implemented (Schuitema et al., 2010a; 
Eliasson, 2014; Weber, 2015); effective policy trials can thus build 
public support for climate policy (see Box 4.8). 
Climate policy and renewable energy systems are more acceptable 
when people strongly value other people and the environment, or 
support egalitarian worldviews, left-wing or green political ideologies 
(Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016), and less acceptable when people 
strongly endorse self-enhancement values, or support individualistic 
and hierarchical worldviews (Dietz et al., 2007; Perlaviciute and Steg, 
2014; Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016). Solar radiation modification 
is more acceptable when people strongly endorse self-enhancement 
values, and less acceptable when they strongly value other people 
and the environment (Visschers et al., 2017). Climate policy is more 
acceptable when people believe climate change is real, when they 
are concerned about climate change (Hornsey et al., 2016), when 
Box 4.6 |  Bottom-up Initiatives: Adaptation Responses Initiated by Individuals and Communities
To effectively adapt to climate change, bottom-up initiatives by individuals and communities are essential, in addition to efforts 
of governments, organizations, and institutions (Wamsler and Brink, 2014a). This box presents examples of bottom-up adaptation 
responses and behavioural change. 
Fiji increasingly faces a lack of freshwater due to decreasing rainfall and rising temperatures (Deo, 2011; IPCC, 2014a). While 
some villages have access to boreholes, these are not sufficient to supply the population with freshwater. Villagers are adapting 
by rationing water, changing diets, and setting up inter-village sharing networks (Pearce et al., 2017). Some villagers take up wage 
employment to buy food instead of growing it themselves (Pearce et al., 2017). In Kiribati, residents adapt to drought by purchasing 
rainwater tanks and constructing additional wells (Kuruppu and Liverman, 2011). An important factor that motivated residents of 
Kiribati to adapt to drought was the perception that they could effectively adapt to the negative consequences of climate change 
(Kuruppu and Liverman, 2011). 
In the Philippines, seismic activity has caused some islands to flood during high tide. While the municipal government offered affected 
island communities the possibility to relocate to the mainland, residents preferred to stay and implement measures themselves in 
their local community to reduce flood damage (Laurice Jamero et al., 2017). Migration is perceived as undesirable because island 
communities have strong place-based identities (Mortreux and Barnett, 2009). Instead, these island communities have adapted to 
flooding by constructing stilted houses and raising floors, furniture, and roads to prevent water damage (Laurice Jamero et al., 2017). 
While inundation was in this case caused by seismic activity, this example indicates how island-based communities may respond to 
rising sea levels caused by climate change. 
Adaptation initiatives by individuals may temporarily reduce the impacts of climate change and enable residents to cope with 
changing environmental circumstances. However, they may not be sufficient to sustain communities’ way of life in the long term. For 
instance, in Fiji and Kiribati, freshwater and food are projected to become even scarcer in the future, rendering individual adaptations 
ineffective. Moreover, individuals can sometimes engage in behaviour that may be maladaptive over larger spatio-temporal scales. 
For example, in the Philippines, many islanders adapt to flooding by elevating their floors using coral stone (Laurice Jamero et 
al., 2017). Over time, this can harm the survivability of their community, as coral reefs are critical for reducing flood vulnerability 
(Ferrario et al., 2014). In Maharashtra, India, on-farm ponds are promoted as rainwater harvesting structures to adapt to dry spells 
during the monsoon season. However, some individuals fill these ponds with groundwater, leading to depletion of water tables and 
potentially maladaptive outcomes in the long run (Kale, 2015).  
Integration of individuals’ adaptation initiatives with top-down adaptation policy is critical (Butler et al., 2015), as failing to do so 
may lead individual actors to mistrust authority and can discourage them from undertaking adequate adaptive actions (Wamsler 
and Brink, 2014a).

they think their actions may reduce climate risks, and when they feel 
responsible to act on climate change (Steg et al., 2005; Eriksson et 
al., 2006; Jakovcevic and Steg, 2013; Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016; 
Kim and Shin, 2017). Stronger environmental awareness is associated 
with a preference for governmental regulation and behaviour change 
rather than free-market and technological solutions (Poortinga et al., 
2002). 
Climate policy is more acceptable when costs and benefits are 
distributed equally, when nature and future generations are 
protected (Sjöberg and Drottz-Sjöberg, 2001; Schuitema et al., 2011; 
Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016), and when fair procedures have 
been followed, including participation by the public (Dietz, 2013; 
Bernauer et al., 2016a; Bidwell, 2016) or public society organizations 
(Bernauer and Gampfer, 2013). Providing benefits to compensate 
affected communities for losses due to policy or systems changes 
enhanced public acceptability in some cases (Perlaviciute and Steg, 
2014), although people may disagree on what would be a worthwhile 
compensation (Aitken, 2010; Cass et al., 2010), or feel they are being 
bribed (Cass et al., 2010; Perlaviciute and Steg, 2014). 
Public support is higher when individuals trust responsible parties 
(Perlaviciute and Steg, 2014; Drews and Van den Bergh, 2016). Yet, 
public support for multilateral climate policy is not higher than for 
unilateral policy (Bernauer and Gampfer, 2015); public support for 
unilateral, non-reciprocal climate policy is rather strong and robust 
(Bernauer et al., 2016b). Public opposition may result from a culturally 
valued landscape being affected by adaptation or mitigation options, 
such as renewable energy development (Warren et al., 2005; Devine-
wright and Howes, 2010) or coastal protection measures (Kimura, 
2016), particularly when people have formed strong emotional bonds 
with the place (Devine-Wright, 2009, 2013). 
Climate actions may reduce human well-being when such actions 
involve more costs, effort or discomfort. Yet some climate actions 
enhance well-being, such as technology that improves daily comfort 
and nature-based solutions for climate adaptation (Wamsler and Brink, 
2014b). Further, climate action may enhance well-being (Kasser and 
Sheldon, 2002; Xiao et al., 2011; Schmitt et al., 2018) because pursuing 
meaning by acting on climate change can make people feel good 
(Venhoeven et al., 2013, 2016; Taufik et al., 2015), more so than merely 
pursuing pleasure.
4.4.4 
Enabling Technological Innovation
This section focuses on the role of technological innovation in limiting 
warming to 1.5°C, and how innovation can contribute to strengthening 
implementation to move towards or to adapt to 1.5°C worlds. This 
assessment builds on information of technological innovation and 
related policy debates in and after AR5 (Somanathan et al., 2014). 
4.4.4.1 The nature of technological innovations
Technological systems have their own dynamics. New technologies 
have been described as emerging as part of a ‘socio-technical system’ 
that is integrated with social structures and that itself evolves over time 
(Geels and Schot, 2007). This progress is cumulative and accelerating 
(Kauffman, 2002; Arthur, 2009). To illustrate such a process of 
co-evolution: the progress of computer simulation enables us to better 
understand climate, agriculture, and material sciences, contributing 
to upgrading food production and quality, microscale manufacturing 
techniques, and leading to much faster computing technologies, 
resulting, for instance, in better performing photovoltaic (PV) cells. 
A variety of technological developments have and will contribute to 
1.5°C-consistent climate action or the lack of it. They can do this, for 
example, in the form of applications such as smart lighting systems, 
more efficient drilling techniques that make fossil fuels cheaper, or 
precision agriculture. As discussed in Section 4.3.1, costs of PV (IEA, 
2017f) and batteries (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015) have sharply dropped. 
In addition, costs of fuel cells (Iguma and Kidoshi, 2015; Wei et al., 2017) 
and shale gas and oil (Wang et al., 2014; Mills, 2015) have come down 
as a consequence of innovation. 
4.4.4.2 Technologies as enablers of climate action
Since AR5, literature has emerged as to how much future GHG emission 
reductions can be enabled by the rapid progress of general purpose 
technologies (GPTs), consisting of information and communication 
technologies (ICT), including artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet 
of things (IoT), nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, robotics, and so forth 
(WEF, 2015; OECD, 2017c). Although these may contribute to limiting 
warming to 1.5°C, the potential environmental, social and economic 
impacts of new technologies are uncertain. 
Rapid improvement of performance and cost reduction is observed 
for many GPTs. They include AI, sensors, internet, memory storage 
and microelectromechanical systems. The latter GPTs are not usually 
categorized as climate technologies, but they can impact GHG emissions. 
Progress of GPT could help reduce GHG emissions more cost-
effectively. Examples are shown in Table 4.9. It may however, result in 
more emissions by increasing the volume of economic activities, with 
unintended negative consequence on sustainable development. While 
ICT increases electricity consumption (Aebischer and Hilty, 2015), the 
energy consumption of ICT is usually dwarfed by the energy saving by 
ICT (Koomey et al., 2013; Malmodin et al., 2014), but rebound effects 
and other sustainable development impacts may be significant. An 
appropriate policy framework that accommodates such impacts and 
their uncertainties could address the potential negative impacts by GPT 
(Jasanoff, 2007).
GHG emission reduction potentials in relation to GPTs were estimated 
for passenger cars using a combination of three emerging technologies: 
electric vehicles, car sharing, and self-driving. GHG emission reduction 
potential is reported, assuming generation of electricity with low GHG 
emissions (Greenblatt and Saxena, 2015; ITF, 2015; Viegas et al., 2016; 
Fulton et al., 2017). It is also possible that GHG emissions increase due 
to an incentive to car use. Appropriate policies such as urban planning 
and efficiency regulations could contain such rebound effects (Wadud 
et al., 2016). 
Estimating emission reductions by GPT is difficult due to substantial 
uncertainties, including projections of future technological performance, 
370

costs, penetration rates, and induced human activity. Even if a 
technology is available, the establishment of business models might 
not be feasible (Linder and Williander, 2017). Indeed, studies show a 
wide range of estimates, ranging from deep emission reductions to 
possible increases in emissions due to the rebound effect (Larson and 
Zhao, 2017). 
GPT could also enable climate adaptation, in particular through more 
effective climate disaster risk management and improved weather 
forecasting.

options are not exhaustive, and the GPTs by themselves do not reduce emissions or increase climate change resilience.
Government policy usually plays a role in promoting or limiting 
GPTs, or science and technology in general. It has impacts on climate 
action, because the performance of further climate technologies 
will partly depend on the progress of GPTs. Governments have 
established institutions for achieving many social, and sometimes 
conflicting goals, including economic growth and addressing climate 
change (OECD, 2017c), which include investment in basic research 
and development (R&D) that can help develop game-changing 
technologies (Shayegh et al., 2017). Governments are also needed 
to create an enabling environment for the growth of scientific and 
technological ecosystems necessary for GPT development (Tassey, 
2014).
4.4.4.3 The role of government in 1.5°C-consistent 
climate technology policy
While literature on 1.5°C-specific innovation policy is absent, a growing 
body of literature indicates that governments aim to achieve social, 
economic and environmental goals by promoting science and a broad 
range of technologies through ‘mission-driven’ innovation policies, 
based on differentiated national priorities (Edler and Fagerberg, 
2017). Governments can play a role in advancing climate technology 
via a ‘technology push’ policy on the technology supply side (e.g., 
R&D subsidies), and by ‘demand pull’ policy on the demand side (e.g., 
energy-efficiency regulation), and these policies can be complemented 
by enabling environments (Somanathan et al., 2014). Governments may 
also play a role in removing existent support for incumbents (Kivimaa 
and Kern, 2016). A growing literature indicates that policy mixes, rather 
than single policy instruments, are more effective in addressing climate 
innovation challenges ranging from technologies in the R&D phase to 
those ready for diffusion (Veugelers, 2012; Quitzow, 2015; Rogge et al., 
2017; Rosenow et al., 2017). Such innovation policies can help address 
two kinds of externalities: environmental externalities and proprietary 
problems (GEA, 2012; IPCC, 2014b; Mazzucato and Semieniuk, 2017). To 
avoid ‘picking winners’, governments often maintain a broad portfolio 
of technological options (Kverndokk and Rosendahl, 2007) and work in 
371

Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
close collaboration with the industrial sector and society in general. Some 
governments have achieved relative success in supporting innovation 
policies (Grubler et al., 2012; Mazzucato, 2013) that addressed climate-
related R&D (see Box 4.7 on bioethanol in Brazil). 
Box 4.7 |  Bioethanol in Brazil: Innovation and Lessons for Technology Transfer
The use of sugarcane as a bioenergy source started in Brazil in the 1970s. Government and multinational car factories modified 
car engines nationwide so that vehicles running only on ethanol could be produced. As demand grew, production and distribution 
systems matured and costs came down (Soccol et al., 2010). After a transition period in which both ethanol-only and gasoline-only 
cars were used, the flex-fuel era started in 2003, when all gasoline was blended with 25% ethanol (de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011). By 
2010, around 80% of the car fleet in Brazil had been converted to use flex-fuel (Goldemberg, 2011; Su et al., 2015). 
More than forty years of combining technology push and market pull measures led to the deployment of ethanol production, 
transportation and distribution systems across Brazil, leading to a significant decrease in CO2 emissions (Macedo et al., 2008). 
Examples of innovations include: (i) the development of environmentally well-adapted varieties of sugarcane; (ii) the development 
and scaling up of sugar fermentation in a non-sterile environment, and (iii) the development of adaptations of car engines to use 
ethanol as a fuel in isolation or in combination with gasoline (Amorim et al., 2011; de Freitas and Kaneko, 2011; De Souza et al., 
2014). Public procurement, public investment in R&D and mandated fuel blends accompanying these innovations were also crucial 
(Hogarth, 2017). In the future, innovation could lead to viable partial CO2 removal through deployment of BECCS associated with 
the bioethanol refineries (Fuss et al., 2014; Rochedo et al., 2016) (see Section 4.3.7).
Ethanol appears to reduce urban car emission of health-affecting ultrafine particles by 30% compared to gasoline-based cars, 
but increases ozone (Salvo et al., 2017). During the 1990s, when sugarcane burning was still prevalent, particulate pollution had 
negative consequences for human health and the environment (Ribeiro, 2008; Paraiso and Gouveia, 2015). While Jaiswal et al. 
(2017) report bioethanol’s limited impact on food production and forests in Brazil, despite the large scale, and attribute this to 
specific agro-ecological zoning legislation, various studies report adverse effects of bioenergy production through forest substitution 
by croplands (Searchinger et al., 2008), as well as impacts on biodiversity, water resources and food security (Rathore et al., 2016). 
For new generation biofuels, feasibility and life cycle assessment studies can provide information on their impacts on environmental, 
economic and social factors (Rathore et al., 2016).
Brazil and the European Union have tried to replicate Brazil’s bioethanol experience in climatically suitable African countries. 
Although such technology transfer achieved relative success in Angola and Sudan, the attempts to set up bioethanol value chains 
did not pass the phase of political deliberations and feasibility studies elsewhere in Africa. Lessons learned include the need for 
political and economic stability of the donor country (Brazil) and the necessity for market creation to attract investments in first-
generation biofuels alongside a safe legal and policy environment for improved technologies (Afionis et al., 2014; Favretto et al., 
2017). 
Funding for R&D could come from various sources, including the general 
budget, energy or resource taxation, or emission trading schemes (see 
Section 4.4.5). Investing in climate-related R&D has as an additional 
benefit of building capabilities to implement climate mitigation and 
adaptation technologies (Ockwell et al., 2015). Countries regard 
innovation in general and climate technology specifically as a national 
interests issue and addressing climate change primarily as being in 
the global interest. Reframing part of climate policy as technology or 
industrial policy might therefore contribute to resolving the difficulties 
that continue to plague emission target negotiations  (Faehn and 
Isaksen, 2016; Fischer et al., 2017; Lachapelle et al., 2017). 
Climate technology transfer to emerging economies has happened 
regardless of international treaties, as these countries have been keen 
to acquire them, and companies have an incentive to access emerging 
markets to remain competitive (Glachant and Dechezleprêtre, 2016). 
However, the complexity of these transfer processes is high, and 
they have to be conducted carefully by governments and institutions 
(Favretto et al., 2017). It is noticeable that the impact of the EU emission 
trading scheme (EU ETS) on innovation is contested; recent work 
(based on lower carbon prices than anticipated for 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways) indicates that it is limited (Calel and Dechezleprêtre, 2016), 
but earlier assessments (Blanco et al., 2014) indicate otherwise. 
4.4.4.4 Technology transfer in the Paris Agreement
Technology development and transfer is recognized as an enabler of both 
mitigation and adaptation in Article 10 in the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 
2016) as well as in Article 4.5 of the original text of the UNFCCC (UNFCCC, 
1992). As previous sections have focused on technology development 
and diffusion, this section focuses on technology transfer. Technology 
transfer can adapt technologies to local circumstances, reduce financing 
costs, develop indigenous technology, and build capabilities to operate, 
maintain, adapt and innovate on technology globally (Ockwell et al., 
2015; de Coninck and Sagar, 2017). Technology cooperation could 
decrease global mitigation cost, and enhance developing countries’ 
mitigation contributions (Huang et al., 2017a).

The international institutional landscape around technology 
development and transfer includes the UNFCCC (via its technology 
framework and Technology Mechanism including the Climate 
Technology Centre and Network (CTCN)), the United Nations (a 
technology facilitation mechanism for the SDGs) and a variety of 
non-UN multilateral and bilateral cooperation initiatives such as the 
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR, 
founded in the 1970s), and numerous initiatives of companies, 
foundations, governments and non-governmental and academic 
organizations. Moreover, in 2015, twenty countries launched an 
initiative called ‘Mission Innovation’, seeking to double their energy 
R&D funding. At this point it is difficult to evaluate whether Mission 
Innovation achieved its objective (Sanchez and Sivaram, 2017). At 
the same time, the private sector started an innovation initiative 
called the ‘Breakthrough Energy Coalition’. 
Most technology transfer is driven by through markets by the 
interests of technology seekers and technology holders, particularly 
in regions with well-developed institutional and technological 
capabilities such as developed and emerging nations (Glachant and 
Dechezleprêtre, 2016). However, the current international technology 
transfer landscape has gaps, in particular in reaching out to least-
developed countries, where institutional and technology capabilities 
are limited (de Coninck and Puig, 2015; Ockwell and Byrne, 2016). 
On the one hand, literature suggests that the management or even 
monitoring of all these UN, bilateral, private and public initiatives 
may fail to lead to better results. On the other hand, it is probably 
more cost-effective to adopt a strategy of ‘letting a thousand flowers 
bloom’, by challenging and enticing researchers in the public and 
the private sector to direct innovation towards low-emission and 
adaptation options (Haselip et al., 2015). This can be done at the 
same time as mission-oriented research is adopted in parallel by the 
scientific community (Mazzucato, 2018).
At COP 21, the UNFCCC requested the Subsidiary Body for Scientific 
and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to initiate the elaboration of 
the technology framework established under the Paris Agreement 
(UNFCCC, 2016). Among other things, the technology framework 
would ‘provide overarching guidance for the work of the Technology 
Mechanism in promoting and facilitating enhanced action on 
technology development and transfer in order to support the 
implementation of this Agreement’ (this Agreement being the 
Paris Agreement). An enhanced guidance issued by the Technology 
Executive Committee (TEC) for preparing a technology action plan 
(TAP) supports the new technology framework as well as the Parties’ 
long-term vision on technology development and transfer, reflected 
in the Paris Agreement (TEC, 2016). 
4.4.5 
Strengthening Policy Instruments and Enabling 
Climate Finance
Triggering rapid and far-reaching change in technical choices and 
institutional arrangements, consumption and lifestyles, infrastructure, 
land use, and spatial patterns implies the ability to scale up policy signals 
to enable the decoupling of GHGs emission, and economic growth and 
development (Section 4.2.2.3). Such a scale-up would also imply that 
potential short-term negative responses by populations and interest 
groups, which could block these changes from the outset, would need 
to be prevented or overcome. This section describes the size and nature 
of investment needs and the financial challenge over the coming two 
decades in the context of 1.5°C warmer worlds, assesses the potential 
and constraints of three categories of policy instruments that respond to 
the challenge, and explains the conditions for using them synergistically. 
The policy and finance instruments discussed in this section relate to 
Section 4.4.1 (on governance) and other Sections in 4.4.
4.4.5.1 The core challenge: cost-efficiency, coordination 
of expectations and distributive effects
Box 4.8 shows that the average estimate by seven models of annual 
investment needs in the energy system is around 2.38 trillion USD2010 
(1.38 to 3.25) between 2016 and 2035. This represents between 2.53% 
(1.6–4%) of the world GDP in market exchange rates (MER) and 1.7% 
of the world GDP in purchasing power parity (PPP). OECD investment 
assessments for a 2°C-consistent transition suggest that including 
investments in transportation and in other infrastructure would increase 
the investment needs by a factor of three. Other studies not included in 
Box 4.8, in particular by the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2013) and the 
Global Commission on the Economy and Climate (GCEC, 2014) confirm 
these orders of magnitude of investment.
The average increase of investment in the energy sector resulting from 
Box 4.8 represents a mean value of 1.5% of the total world investment 
compared with the baselines scenario in MER and a little over 1% in 
PPP. Including infrastructure investments would raise this to 2.5% and 
1.7% respectively.9 
These incremental investments could be funded through a drain on 
consumption (Bowen et al., 2017), which would necessitate between 
0.68% and 0.45% lower global consumption than in the baseline. But, 
consumption at a constant savings/consumption ratio can alternatively 
be funded by shifting savings towards productive adaptation and 
mitigation investments, instead of real-estate sector and liquid financial 
products. This response depends upon whether it is possible to close the 
global investment funding gap for infrastructure that potentially inhibits 
growth, through structural changes in the global economy. In this case, 
investing more in infrastructure would not be an incremental cost in 
terms of development and welfare (IMF, 2014; Gurara et al., 2017)
9 
A calculation in MER tends indeed to underestimate the world GDP and its growth by giving a lower weight to fast-growing developing countries, whereas a calculation 
in PPP tends to overestimate it. The difference between the value of two currencies in PPP and MER should vanish as the gap of the income levels of the two concerned 
countries decreases. Accounting for this trend in modelling is challenging.

Box 4.8 |  Investment Needs and the Financial Challenge of Limiting Warming to 1.5°C 
Peer-reviewed literature that estimates the investment needs over the next two decades to scale up the response to limit warming 
to 1.5°C is very limited (see Section 4.6). This box attempts to bring together available estimates of the order of magnitude of 
these investments, after consultation with the makers of those estimates, to provide the context for global and national financial 
mobilization policy and related institutional arrangements.
Table 1 in this box presents mean annual investments up to 2035, based on three studies (after clarifying their scope and harmonizing 
their metrics): an ensemble of four integrated assessment models (here denoted IAM, see Chapter 2), an Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) scenario for a 2°C limit (OECD, 2017a) and scenarios from the International Energy Agency 
(IEA, 2016c). All three sources provide estimates for the energy sector for various mitigation scenarios. They give a mean value 
of 2.38 trillion USD of yearly investments in the energy sector over the period, with minimum and maximum values of 1.38 and 
3.25 respectively. We also report the OECD estimate for 2°C because it also covers transportation and other infrastructure (water, 
sanitation, and telecommunication), which are essential to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 7 on 
clean energy access, and enhance the adaptive capacity to climate change.
The mean incremental share of annual energy investments to stay well below 2°C is 0.36% (between 0.2–1%) of global GDP 
between 2016 and 2035. Since total world investment (also called gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)) is about 24% of global 
GDP, the estimated incremental energy investments between a baseline and a 1.5°C transition would be approximately 1.5% 
(between 0.8–4.2%) of projected total world investments. As the higher ends of these ranges reflect pessimistic assumptions 
in 1.5°C-consistent pathways  on technological change, the implementation of policies to accelerate technical change (see the 
remainder of Section 4.4.5) could lower the probability of higher incremental investment. 
If we assume the amounts of investments given by the OECD for transportation and other infrastructure for warming of 2°C to be 
a lower limit for an 1.5°C pathway, then total incremental investments for all sectors for a 1.5°C-consistent pathway would be 
estimated at 2.4% of total world investments. This total incremental investment reaches 2.53% if the investments in transportation 
are scaled up proportionally with the investments in the energy sector and if all other investments are kept constant. Comparing this 
2.4% or 2.53% number for all sectors to the 1.5% number for energy only (see previous paragraph) suggests that the investments in 
sectors other than energy contribute significantly to incremental world investments, even though a comprehensive study or estimate 
of these investments for a 1.5°C limit is not available.
The issue, from a macroeconomic perspective, is whether these investments would be funded by higher savings at the costs of lower 
consumption. This would mean a 0.5% reduction in consumption for the energy sector for 1.5°C. Note that for a 2°C scenario, this

reduction would be 0.8% if we account for the investment needs of all infrastructure sectors. Assuming conversely a constant 
savings ratio, this would necessitate reallocating existing capital flows towards infrastructure. In addition to these incremental 
investments, the amount of redirected investments is relevant from a financial perspective. In the reported IAM energy sector 
scenarios, about three times the incremental investments is redirected. There is no such assessment for the other sectors. The OECD 
report suggests that these ratios might be higher.
These orders of magnitude of investment can be compared to the available statistics of the global stock of 386 trillion USD of 
financial capital, which consists of 100 trillion USD in bonds (SIFMA, 2017), around 60 trillion USD in equity (World Bank, 2018b), 
and 226 trillion USD of loans managed by the banking system (IIF, 2017; World Bank, 2018a). The long-term rate of return (interest 
plus increase of shareholder value) is about 3% on bonds, 5% on bank lending and 7% on equity, leading to a weighted mean return 
on capital of 3.4% in real terms (5.4% in nominal terms). Using 3.4% as a lower bound and 5% as a higher bound (following Piketty, 
2014) and taking a conservative assumption that global financial capital grows at the same rate as global GDP, the estimated yearly 
financial capital revenues would be between 16.8 and 25.4 trillion USD.
Assuming that a quarter of these investments comes from public funds (as estimated by the World Bank; World Bank, 2018a), the 
amount of private resources needed to enable an energy sector transition is between 3.3% and 5.3% of annual capital income and 
between 5.6% and 8.3% of these revenues for all infrastructure to meet the 2°C limit and the SDGs.
Since the financial system has limited fungibility across budget lines, changing the partitioning of investments is not a zero-sum 
game. An effective policy regime could encourage investment managers to change their asset allocation. Part of the challenge may 
lie in increasing the pace of financing of low-emission assets to compensate for a possible 38% decrease, by 2035, in the value of 
fossil fuel assets (energy sector and indirect holdings in downstream uses like automobiles) (Mercure et al., 2018).
Box 4.8 (continued)
Investments in other (non-energy system) infrastructure to meet 
development and poverty-reduction goals can strengthen the adaptive 
capacity to address climate change, and are difficult to separate from 
overall sustainable development and poverty-alleviation investments 
(Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017). The magnitude of potential climate 
change damages is related to pre-existing fragility of impacted 
societies (Hallegatte et al., 2007). Enhancing infrastructure and service 
provision would lower this fragility, for example, through the provision 
of universal (water, sanitation, telecommunication) service access 
(Arezki et al., 2016). 
The main challenge is thus not just a lack of mobilization of aggregate 
resources but of redirection of savings towards infrastructure, and 
the further redirection of these infrastructure investments towards 
low-emission options. If emission-free assets emerge fast enough to 
compensate for the devaluation of high-emission assets, the sum of 
the required incremental and redirected investments in the energy 
sector would (up to 2035) be equivalent to between 3.3% and 5.3% 
of the average annual revenues of the private capital stock (see Box 
4.8) and to between 5.6% and 8.3%, including all infrastructure 
investments.
The interplay between mechanisms of financial intermediation 
and the private risk-return calculus is a major barrier to realizing 
these investments (Sirkis et al., 2015). This obstacle is not specific to 
climate mitigation investments but also affects infrastructure and 
has been characterised as the gap between the ‘propensity to save’ 
and the ‘propensity to invest’ (Summers, 2016). The issue is whether 
new financial instruments could close this gap and inject liquidity 
into the low-emission transition, thereby unlocking new economic 
opportunities (GCEC, 2014; NCE, 2016). By offsetting the crowding-out 
of other private and public investments (Pollitt and Mercure, 2017), the 
ensuing  ripple effect could reinforce growth and the sustainability of 
development (King, 2011; Teulings and Baldwin, 2014) and potentially 
trigger a new growth cycle (Stern, 2013, 2015). In this case, a massive 
mobilization of low-emission investments would require a significant 
effort but may be complementary to sustainable development 
investments.  
This uncertain but potentially positive outcome might be constrained 
by the higher energy costs of low-emission options in the energy and 
transportation sectors. The envelope of worldwide marginal abatement 
costs for 1.5°C-consistent pathways reported in Chapter 2 is 135–5500 
USD2010 tCO2
−1 in 2030 and 245–13000 USD2010 tCO2
−1 in 2050, 
which is between three to four times higher than for a 2°C limit.
These figures are consistent with the dramatic reduction in the unit 
costs of some low-emission technical options (for example solar 
PV, LED lighting) over the past decade (see Section 4.3.1) (OECD, 
2017c). Yet there are multiple constraints to a system-wide energy 
transition. Lower costs of some supply- and demand-side options do 
not always result in a proportional decrease in energy system costs. 
The adoption of alternative options can be slowed down by increasing 
costs of decommissioning existing infrastructure, the inertia of market 
structures, cultural habits and risk-adverse user behaviour (see Sections 
4.4.1 to 4.4.3). Learning-by-doing processes and R&D can accelerate 
the cost-efficiency of low-emission technology but often imply higher 
early-phase costs. The German energy transition resulted in high 
consumer prices for electricity in Germany (Kreuz and Müsgens, 2017) 
and needed strong accompanying measures to succeed.

Chapter 4
One key issue is that energy costs can propagate across sectors and 
amplify overall production costs. During the early stage of a low-
emission transition, an increase in the prices of non-energy goods could 
reduce consumer purchasing power and final demand. A rise in energy 
prices has a proportionally greater impact in developing countries 
that are in a catch-up phase, as they have a stronger dependence on 
energy-intensive sectors (Crassous et al., 2006; Luderer et al., 2012) 
and a higher ratio of energy to labour cost (Waisman et al., 2012). This 
explains why with lower carbon prices, similar emission reductions are 
reached in South Africa (Altieri et al., 2016) and Brazil (La Rovere et al., 
2017a) compared to developed countries. However, three distributional 
issues emerge. 
First, in the absence of countervailing policies, higher energy costs 
have an adverse effect on the distribution of welfare (see also 
Chapter 5). The negative impact is inversely correlated with the 
level of income (Harberger, 1984; Fleurbaey and Hammond, 2004) 
and positively correlated with the share of energy in the households 
budget, which is high for low- and middle-income households 
(Proost and Van Regemorter, 1995; Barker and Kohler, 1998; West 
and Williams, 2004; Chiroleu-Assouline and Fodha, 2011). Moreover, 
climatic conditions and the geographical conditions of human 
settlements matter for heating and mobility needs (see Chapter 5). 
Medium-income populations in the suburbs, in remote areas, and in 
low-density regions can be as vulnerable as residents of low-income 
urban areas. Poor households with low levels of energy consumption 
are also impacted by price increases of non-energy goods caused by 
the propagation of energy costs (Combet et al., 2010; Dubois, 2012). 
These impacts are generally not offset by non-market co-benefits of 
climate policies for the poor (Baumgärtner et al., 2017).
A second matter of concern is the distortion of international competition 
and employment implications in the case of uneven carbon constraints, 
especially for energy-intensive industries (Demailly and Quirion, 2008). 
Some of these industries are not highly exposed to international 
competition because of their very high transportation costs per unit 
value added (Sartor, 2013; Branger et al., 2016), but other industries 
could suffer severe shocks, generate ‘carbon leakage’ through cheaper 
imports from countries with lower carbon constraints (Branger and 
Quirion, 2014), and weaken the surrounding regional industrial fabric 
with economy-wide and employment implications.
A third challenge is the depreciation of assets whose value is based on 
the valuation of fossil energy resources, of which future revenues may 
decline precipitously with higher carbon prices (Waisman et al., 2013; 
Jakob and Hilaire, 2015; McGlade and Ekins, 2015), and on emission-
intensive capital stocks (Guivarch and Hallegatte, 2011; OECD, 2015a; 
Pfeiffer et al., 2016). This raises issues of changes in industrial structure, 
adaptation of worker skills, and of stability of financial, insurance and 
social security systems. These systems are in part based on current 
holdings of carbon-based assets whose value might decrease by about 
38% by the mid-2030s (Mercure et al., 2018). This stranded asset 
challenge may be exacerbated by a decline of export revenues of fossil 
fuel producing countries and regions (Waisman et al., 2013; Jakob and 
Hilaire, 2015; McGlade and Ekins, 2015).
These distributional issues, if addressed carefully and expeditiously, could 
affect popular sensitivity towards climate policies. Addressing them 
could mitigate adverse macroeconomic effects on economic growth and 
employment that could undermine the potential benefits of a redirection 
of savings and investments towards 1.5°C-consistent pathways.
Strengthening policy instruments for a low-emission transition would 
thus need to reconcile three objectives: (i) handling the short-term 
frictions inherent to this transition in an equitable way, (ii) minimizing 
these frictions by lowering the cost of avoided GHGs emissions, and (iii) 
coordinating expectations of multiple stakeholders at various decision-
making levels to accelerate the decline in costs of emission reduction, 
efficiency and decoupling options and maximizing their co-benefits 
(see the practical example of lowering car use in cities in Box 4.9).
Three categories of policy tools would be available to meet the 
distributional challenges: carbon pricing, regulatory instruments and 
information and financial tools. Each of them has its own strengths 
and weaknesses, from a 1.5°C perspective, policy tools would have to 
be both scaled up and better coordinated in packages in a synergistic 
manner.
4.4.5.2 Carbon pricing: necessity and constraints
Economic literature has long argued that climate and energy policy 
grounded only in regulation, standards and public funding of R&D is 
at risk of being influenced by political and administrative arbitrariness, 
which could raise the costs of implementation. This literature has argued 
that it may be more efficient to make these costs explicit through carbon 
taxes and carbon trading, securing the abatement of emissions in places 
and sectors where it is cheapest (IPCC, 1995, 2001; Gupta et al., 2007; 
Somanathan et al., 2014).
In a frictionless world, a uniform world carbon price could minimize the 
social costs of the low-carbon transition by equating the marginal costs 
of abatement across all sources of emissions. This implies that investors 
will be able to make the right choices under perfect foresight and that 
domestic and international compensatory transfers offset the adverse 
distributional impacts of higher energy prices and their consequences on 
economic activity. In the absence of such transfers, carbon prices would 
have to be differentiated by jurisdiction (Chichilnisky and Heal, 2000; 
Sheeran, 2006; Böhringer et al., 2009; Böhringer and Alexeeva-Talebi, 
2013). This differentiation could in turn raise concerns of distortions in 
international competition (Hourcade et al., 2001; Stavins et al., 2014).
Obstacles to enforcing a uniform world carbon price in the short run 
would not necessarily crowd out explicit national carbon pricing, for 
three reasons. First, a uniform carbon price would limit an emissions 
rebound resulting from a higher consumption of energy services 
enabled by efficiency gains, if energy prices do not change (Greening et 
al., 2000; Fleurbaey and Hammond, 2004; Sorrell et al., 2009; Guivarch 
and Hallegatte, 2011; Chitnis and Sorrell, 2015; Freire-González, 2017). 
Second, it could hedge against the arbitrariness of regulatory policies. 
Third, ‘revenue neutral’ recycling, at a constant share of taxes on GDP, 
into lowering some existing taxes would compensate for at least part 
of the propagation effect of higher energy costs (Stiglitz et al., 2017).

Box 4.9 |  Emerging Cities and ‘Peak Car Use’: Evidence of Decoupling in Beijing 
The phenomenon of ‘peak car use’, or reductions in per capita car use, provides hope for continuing reductions in greenhouse 
gases from oil consumption (Millard-Ball and Schipper, 2011; Newman and Kenworthy, 2011; Goodwin and Van Dender, 2013). The 
phenomenon has been mostly associated with developed cities apart from some early signs in Eastern Europe, Latin America and 
China (Newman and Kenworthy, 2015). New research indicates that peak car is now also underway in China (Gao and Newman, 
2018). 
China’s rapid urban motorization was a result of strong economic growth, fast urban development and the prosperity of the Chinese 
automobile industry (Gao et al., 2015). However, recent data (Gao and Newman, 2018) (expressed as a percentage of daily trips) 
suggest the first signs of a break in the growth of car use along with the growth in mass transit, primarily the expansion of Metro 
systems (see Box 4.9, Figure 1). 
Chinese urban fabrics, featuring traditional dense linear forms and mixed land use, favour mass transit systems over automobiles 
(Gao and Newman, 2018). The data show that the decline in car use did not impede economic development, but the growth in 
vehicle kilometres of travel (VKT) has decoupled absolutely from GDP as shown in Box 4.9, Figure 2 below.
economy can counteract the regressive effect of higher energy prices. For 
example, offsetting increased carbon prices with lower labour taxes can 
potentially decrease labour costs (without affecting salaries), enhance 
employment and reduce the attractiveness of informal economic activity 
(Goulder, 2013).
The conditions under which an economic gain along with climate 
benefit (a ‘double dividend’) can be expected are well documented

(Goulder, 1995; Bovenberg, 1999; Mooij, 2000). In the context of OECD 
countries, the literature examines how carbon taxation could substitute 
for other taxes to fund the social security system (Combet, 2013). The 
same general principles apply for countries that are building their social 
welfare system, such as China (Li and Wang, 2012) or Brazil (La Rovere 
et al., 2017a), but an optimal recycling scheme could differ based on the 
structure of the economy (Lefèvre et al., 2018).

4.4.5.3 Regulatory measures and information flows 
Regulatory instruments are a common tool for improving energy 
efficiency and enhancing renewable energy in OECD countries (e.g., the 
USA, Japan, Korea, Australia, the EU) and, more recently, in developing 
countries (M.J. Scott et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2017). Such instruments 
include constraints on the import of products banned in other countries 
(Knoop and Lechtenböhmer, 2017).
For energy efficiency, these instruments include end-use standards and 
labelling for domestic appliances, lighting, electric motors, water heaters 
and air-conditioners. They are often complemented by mandatory 
efficiency labels to attract consumers’ attention and stimulate the 
manufacture of more efficient products (Girod et al., 2017). Experience 
shows that these policy instruments are effective only if they are 
regularly reviewed to follow technological developments, as in the ‘Top 
Runner’ programme for domestic appliances in Japan (Sunikka-Blank 
and Iwafune, 2011).
In four countries, efficiency standards (e.g. miles per gallon or level of 
CO2 emission per kilometre) have been used in the transport sector, 
for light- and heavy-duty vehicles, which have spillovers for the global 
car industry. In the EU (Ajanovic and Haas, 2017) and the USA (Sen 
et al., 2017), vehicle manufacturers need to meet an annual CO2 
emission target for their entire new vehicle fleet. This allows them to 
compensate through the introduction of low-emission vehicles for the 
high-emission ones in the fleet. This leads to increasingly efficient fleets 
of vehicles over time but does not necessarily limit the driven distance.
Building codes that prescribe efficiency requirements for new and 
existing buildings have been adopted in many OECD countries (Evans 
et al., 2017) and are regularly revised to increase their efficiency per 
unit of floor space. Building codes can avoid locking rapidly urbanizing 
countries into poorly performing buildings that remain in use for the 
next 50–100 years (Ürge-Vorsatz et al., 2014). In OECD countries, 
however, their main role is to incentivize the retrofit of existing 
buildings. In addition of the convergence of these codes to net zero 
energy buildings (D’Agostino, 2015), a new focus should be placed, 
in the context of 1.5°C-consistent pathways, on public and private 
coordination to achieve better integration of building policies with the 
promotion of low-emission transportation modes (Bertoldi, 2017).
The efficacy of regulatory instruments can be reinforced by economic 
incentives, such as feed-in tariffs based on the quantity of renewable 
energy produced, subsidies or tax exemptions for energy savings 
(Bertoldi et al., 2013; Ritzenhofen and Spinler, 2016; García-Álvarez et 
al., 2017; Pablo-Romero et al., 2017), fee-bates, and ‘bonus-malus’ that 
foster the penetration of low-emission options (Butler and Neuhoff, 
2008). Economic incentives can also be combined with direct-use 
market-based instruments, for example combining, in the United 
States and, in some EU countries, carbon trading schemes with energy 
savings obligations for energy retailers (Haoqi et al., 2017), or with 
green certificates for renewable energy portfolio standards (Upton and 
Snyder, 2017). Scholars have investigated caps on utilities’ energy sales 
(Thomas et al., 2017) and emission caps implemented at a personal 
level (Fawcett et al., 2010).
In every country the design of carbon pricing policy implies a balance 
between incentivizing low-carbon behaviour and mitigating the 
adverse distributional consequences of higher energy prices (Combet 
et al., 2010). Carbon taxes can offset these effects if their revenues 
are redistributed through rebates to poor households. Other options 
include the reduction of value-added taxes for basic products or direct 
benefit transfers to enable poverty reduction (see Winkler et al. (2017) 
for South Africa and Grottera et al. (2016) for Brazil). This is possible 
because higher-income households pay more in absolute terms, even 
though their carbon tax burden is a relatively smaller share of their 
income (Arze del Granado et al., 2012).
Ultimately, the pace of increase of carbon prices would depend on the 
pace at which they can be embedded in a consistent set of fiscal and 
social policies. This is specifically critical in the context of the 1.5°C 
limit (Michaelowa et al., 2018). This is why, after a quarter century of 
academic debate and experimentation (see IPCC WGIII reports since 
the SAR), a gap persists with respect to ‘switching carbon prices’ 
needed to trigger rapid changes. In 2016, only 15% of global emissions 
are covered by carbon pricing, three-quarters of which with prices 
below 10 USD tCO2
−1 (World Bank, 2016). This is too low to outweigh 
the ‘noise’ from the volatility of oil markets (in the range of 100 USD 
tCO2
−1 over the past decade), of other price dynamics (interest rates, 
currency exchange rates and real estate prices) and of regulatory 
policies in energy, transportation and industry. For example, the 
dynamics of mobility depend upon a trade-off between housing prices 
and transportation costs in which the price of real estate and the inert 
endowments in public transport play as important a role as liquid fuel 
prices (Lampin et al., 2013). 
These considerations apply to attempts to secure a minimum price in 
carbon trading systems (Wood and Jotzo, 2011; Fell et al., 2012; Fuss 
et al., 2018) and to the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies. Estimated at 
650 billion USD in 2015 (Coady et al., 2017), these subsidies represent 
25–30% of government expenditures in forty (mostly developing) 
countries (IEA, 2014b). Reducing these subsidies would contribute to 
reaching 1.5°C-consistent pathways, but raises similar issues as carbon 
pricing around long-term benefits and short-term costs (Jakob et al., 
2015; Zeng and Chen, 2016), as well as social impacts. 
Explicit carbon prices remain a necessary condition of ambitious 
climate policies, and some authors highlight the potential benefit 
brought by coordination among groups of countries (Weischer et al., 
2012; Hermwille et al., 2017; Keohane et al., 2017). They could take the 
form of carbon pricing corridors (Bhattacharya et al., 2015). They are 
a necessary ‘lubricant’ through fiscal reforms or direct compensating 
transfers to accommodate the general equilibrium effects of higher 
energy prices but may not suffice to trigger the low-carbon transition 
because of a persistent ‘implementation gap’ between the aspirational 
carbon prices and those that can practically be enforced. When systemic 
changes, such as those needed for 1.5°C-consistent pathways, are at 
play on many dimensions of development, price levels ‘depend on the 
path and the path depends on political decisions’ (Drèze and Stern, 
1990).

In combination with the funding of public research institutes, grants 
or subsidies also support R&D, where risk and the uncertainty about 
long-term perspectives can reduce the private sector’s willingness to 
invest in low-emission innovation (see also Section 4.4.4). Subsidies can 
take the form of rebates on value-added tax (VAT), of direct support to 
investments (e.g., renewable energy or refurbishment of buildings) or 
feed-in tariffs (Mir-Artigues and del Río, 2014). They can be provided 
by the public budget, via consumption levies, or via the revenues of 
carbon taxes or pricing. Fee-bates, introduced in some countries (e.g., 
for cars), have had a neutral impact on public budgets by incentivizing 
low-emission products and penalizing high-emission ones (de Haan et 
al., 2009).
All policy instruments can benefit from information campaigns (e.g., TV 
ads) tailored to specific end-users. A vast majority of public campaigns on 
energy and climate have been delivered through mass-media channels 
and advertising-based approaches (Corner and Randall, 2011; Doyle, 
2011). Although some authors report large savings obtained by such 
campaigns, most agree that the effects are short-lived and decrease 
over time (Bertoldi et al., 2016). Recently, focus has been placed on the 
use of social norms to motivate behavioural changes (Allcott, 2011; Alló 
and Loureiro, 2014). More on strategies to change behaviour can be 
found in Section 4.4.3.
4.4.5.4 Scaling up climate finance and de-risking 
low-emission investments
The redirection of savings towards low-emission investments may be 
constrained by enforceable carbon prices, implementation of technical 
standards and the short-term bias of financial systems (Miles, 1993; 
Bushee, 2001; Black and Fraser, 2002). The many causes of this bias are 
extensively analysed in economic literature (Tehranian and Waegelein, 
1985; Shleifer and Vishny, 1990; Bikhchandani and Sharma, 2000), 
including their link with prevailing patterns of economic globalization 
(Krugman, 2009; Rajan, 2011) and the chronic underinvestment in 
long-term infrastructure (IMF, 2014). Emerging literature explores how 
to overcome this through reforms targeted to bridge the gap between 
short-term cash balances and long-term low-emission assets and to 
reduce the risk-weighted capital costs of climate-resilient investments. 
This gap, which was qualified by the Governor of the Bank of England as 
a ‘tragedy of the horizon’ (Carney, 2016) that constitutes a threat to the 
stability of the financial system, is confirmed by the literature (Arezki et 
al., 2016; Christophers, 2017). This potential threat would encompass the 
impact of climate events on the value of assets (Battiston et al., 2017), 
liability risks (Heede, 2014) and the transition risk due to devaluation of 
certain classes of assets (Platinga and Scholtens, 2016).
The financial community’s attention to climate change grew after COP 
15 (ESRB ASC, 2016). This led to the introduction of climate-related risk 
disclosure in financial portfolios (UNEP, 2015), placing it on the agenda 
of G20 Green Finance Study Group and of the Financial Stability Board. 
This led to the creation of low-carbon financial indices that investors 
could consider as a ‘free option on carbon’ to hedge against risks of 
stranded carbon-intensive assets (Andersson et al., 2016). This could also 
accelerate the emergence of climate-friendly financial products such as 
green or climate bonds. The estimated value of the green bonds market 
in 2017 is 155 billion USD (BNEF, 2018). The bulk of these investments 
are in renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emission transport 
(Lazurko and Venema, 2017), with only 4% for adaptation (OECD, 
2017b). One major question is whether individual strategies based on 
improved climate-related information alone will enable the financial 
system to allocate capital in an optimal way (Christophers, 2017) since 
climate change is a systemic risk (CISL, 2015; Schoenmaker and van 
Tilburg, 2016).
The readiness of financial actors to reduce investments in fossil fuels 
is a real trend (Platinga and Scholtens, 2016; Ayling and Gunningham, 
2017), but they may not resist the attractiveness of carbon-intensive 
investments in many regions. Hence, decarbonizing an investment 
portfolio is not synonymous with investing massively in low-emission 
infrastructure. Scaling up climate-friendly financial products may 
depend upon a business context conducive to the reduction of the risk-
weighted capital costs of low-emission projects. The typical leverage of 
public funding mechanisms for low-emission investment is low (2 to 4) 
compared with other sectors (10 to 15) (Maclean et al., 2008; Ward et 
al., 2009; MDB, 2016). This is due to the interplay of the uncertainty of 
emerging low-emission technologies in the midst of their learning-by-
doing cycle with uncertain future revenues due to volatility of fossil fuel 
prices (Roques et al., 2008; Gross et al., 2010) as well as uncertainty 
around regulatory policies. This inhibits low-emission investments by 
corporations functioning under a ‘shareholder value business regime’ 
(Berle and Means, 1932; Roe, 1996; Froud et al., 2000) and actors 
with restricted access to capital (e.g. cities, local authorities, SMEs and 
households).
De-risking policy instruments to enable low-emission investment 
encompasses interest rate subsidies, fee-bates, tax breaks, concessional 
loans from development banks, and public investment funds, including 
revolving funds. Given the constraints on public budgets, public 
guarantees can be used to increase the leverage effect of public 
financing on private financing. Such de-risking instruments imply 
indeed a full direct burden on public budgets only in case of default 
of the project. They could back for example various forms of green 
infrastructure funds (de Gouvello and Zelenko, 2010; Emin et al., 2014; 
Studart and Gallagher, 2015).10
The risk of defaulting can be mitigated by strong measurement, reporting 
and verifying (MRV) systems (Bellassen et al., 2015) and by the use of 
notional prices recommended in public economics (and currently in use 
in France and the UK) to calibrate public support to the provision of 
public goods in case of persisting distortions in pricing (Stiglitz et al., 
2017). Some suggest linking these notional prices to ‘social, economic 
and environmental value of voluntary mitigation actions’ recognized by 
the COP 21 Decision accompanying the Paris Agreement (paragraph 
108) (Hourcade et al., 2015; La Rovere et al., 2017b; Shukla et al., 2017), 
in order to incorporate the co-benefits of mitigation.
Such public guarantees ultimately amount to money issuance backed by 
low-emission projects as collateral. This explains the potentially strong 
link between global climate finance and the evolution of the financial

Chapter 4
and monetary system. Amongst suggested mechanisms for this 
evolution are the use of International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) Special 
Drawing Rights to fund the paid-in capital of the Green Climate Fund 
(Bredenkamp and Pattillo, 2010) and the creation of carbon remediation 
assets at a predetermined face value per avoided tonne of emissions 
(Aglietta et al., 2015a, b). Such a predetermined value could hedge 
against the fragmentation of climate finance initiatives and support the 
emergence of financial products backed by a new class of long-term 
assets.
Combining public guarantees at a predetermined value of avoided 
emissions, in addition to improving the consistency of non-price 
measures, could support the emergence of financial products backed 
by a new class of certified assets to attract savers in search of safe and 
ethical investments (Aglietta et al., 2015b). It could hedge against the 
fragmentation of climate finance initiatives and provide a mechanism to 
compensate for the ‘stranded’ assets caused by divestment in carbon-
based activities and in lowering the systemic risk of stranded assets 
(Safarzyńska and van den Bergh, 2017). These new assets could also 
facilitate a low-carbon transition for fossil fuel producers and help them 
to overcome the ‘resource curse’ (Ross, 2015; Venables, 2016).
Blended injection of liquidity has monetary implications. Some argue 
that this questions the premise that money should remain neutral 
(Annicchiarico and Di Dio, 2015, 2016; Nikiforos and Zezza, 2017). 
Central banks or financial regulators could act as a facilitator of last 
resort for low-emission financing instruments, which could in turn lower 
the systemic risk of stranded assets (Safarzyńska and van den Bergh, 
2017). This may, in time, lead to the use of carbon-based monetary 
instruments to diversify reserve currencies (Jaeger et al., 2013) and 
differentiate reserve requirements (Rozenberg et al., 2013) in the 
context of a climate-friendly Bretton Woods (Sirkis et al., 2015; Stua, 
2017).
4.4.5.5 Financial challenge for basic needs and adaptation 
finance
Adaptation finance is difficult to quantify for two reasons. The first is 
that it is very difficult to isolate specific investment needs to enhance 
climate resilience from the provision of basic infrastructure that are 
currently underinvested (IMF, 2014; Gurara et al., 2017). The UNEP 
(2016) estimate of investment needs on adaptation in developing 
countries between 140–300 billion USD yr−1 in 2030, a major part 
being investment expenditures that are complementary with SDG-
related investments focused on universal access to infrastructure and 
services and meeting basic needs. Many climate-adaptation-centric 
financial incentives are relevant to non-market services, offering fewer 
opportunities for market revenues while they contribute to creating 
resilience to climate impacts.    
Hence, adaptation investments and the provision of basic needs would 
typically have to be supported by national and sub-national government 
budgets together with support from overseas development assistance 
and multilateral development banks (Fankhauser and Schmidt-Traub, 
2011; Adenle et al., 2017; Robinson and Dornan, 2017), and a slow 
increase of dedicated NGO and private climate funds (Nakhooda 
and Watson, 2016). Even though the UNEP estimates of the costs of 
adaptation might be lower in a 1.5°C world (UNEP/Climate Analytics, 
2015) they would be higher than the UNEP estimate of 22.5 billion 
USD of bilateral and multilateral funding for climate change adaptation 
in 2014. Currently, 18–25% of climate finance flows to adaptation in 
developing countries (OECD, 2015b, 2016; Shine and Campillo, 2016). It 
remains fragmented, with small proportions flowing through UNFCCC 
channels (AdaptationWatch, 2015; Roberts and Weikmans, 2017).
Means of raising resources for adaptation, achieving the SDGs and 
meeting basic needs (Durand et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2017) include 
the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies (Jakob et al., 2016), increasing 
revenues from carbon taxes (Jakob et al., 2016), levies on international 
aviation and maritime transport, and sharing of the proceeds of financial 
arrangements supporting mitigation activities (Keen et al., 2013). Each 
have different redistribution implications. Challenges, however, include 
the efficient use of resources, the emergence of long-term assets using 
infrastructure as collateral and the capacity to implement small-scale 
adaptation and the mainstreaming of adaptation in overall development 
policies. There is thus a need for greater policy coordination (Fankhauser 
and McDermott, 2014; Morita and Matsumoto, 2015; Sovacool et al., 
2015, 2017; Lemos et al., 2016; Adenle et al., 2017; Peake and Ekins, 
2017) that includes robust mechanisms for tracking, reporting and 
ensuring transparency of adaptation finance (Donner et al., 2016; Pauw 
et al., 2016a; Roberts and Weikmans, 2017; Trabacchi and Buchner, 
2017) and its consistency with the provision of basic needs (Hallegatte 
et al., 2016).
4.4.5.6 Towards integrated policy packages and innovative 
forms of financial cooperation 
Carbon prices, regulation and standards, improved information and 
appropriate financial instruments can work synergistically to meet the 
challenge of ‘making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards 
low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development’, as in 
Article 2 in the Paris Agreement.
There is growing attention to the combination of policy instruments 
that address three domains of action: behavioural changes, economic 
optimization and long-term strategies (Grubb et al., 2014). For example, 
de-risking low-emission investments would result in higher volumes of 
low-emission investments, and would in turn lead to a lower switching 
price for the same climate ambition (Hirth and Steckel, 2016). In the 
reverse direction, higher explicit carbon prices may generate more 
low-emission projects for a given quantum of de-risking. For example, 
efficiency standards for housing can increase the efficacy of carbon prices 
and overcome the barriers coming from the high discount rates used by 
households (Parry et al., 2014), while explicit and notional carbon prices 
can lower the risk of arbitrary standards. The calibration of innovative 
financial instruments to notional carbon prices could encourage large 
multinational companies to increase their level of internal carbon prices 
(UNEP, 2016). These notional prices could be higher than explicit carbon 
prices because they redirect new hardware investments without an 
immediate impact on existing capital stocks and associated interests.
Literature, however, shows that conflicts between poorly articulated 
policy instruments can undermine their efficiency (Lecuyer and 
Quirion, 2013; Bhattacharya et al., 2017; García-Álvarez et al., 2017). 
380
Chapter 4 
Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response

As has been illustrated in Europe, commitment uncertainty and lack of 
credibility of regulation have consistently led to low carbon prices in 
the case of the EU Emission Trading System (Koch et al., 2014, 2016). A 
comparative study shows how these conflicts can be avoided by policy 
packages that integrate many dimensions of public policies and are 
designed to match institutional and social context of each country and 
region (Bataille et al., 2015).
Even though policy packages depend upon domestic political 
processes, they might not reinforce the NDCs at a level consistent with 
the 1.5°C transition without a conducive international setting where 
international development finance plays a critical role. Section 4.4.1 
explores the means of mainstreaming climate finance in the current 
evolution of the lending practices of national and multilateral banks 
(Badré, 2018). This could facilitate the access of developing countries 
to loans via bond markets at low interest rates, encouragement 
of the emergence of new business models for infrastructure, 
and encouragement of  financial markets to support small-scale 
investments (Déau and Touati, 2017).
These financial innovations may involve non-state public actors 
like cities and regional public authorities that govern infrastructure 
investment, enable energy and food systems transitions and manage 
urban dynamics (Cartwright, 2015). They would help, for example, in 
raising the 4.5–5.4 trillion USD yr−1 from 2015 to 2030 announced 
by the Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance (CCFLA, 2016) to 
achieve the commitments by the Covenant of Mayors of many cities to 
long-term climate targets (Kona et al., 2018).
The evolution of global climate financial cooperation may involve 
central banks, financial regulatory authorities, and multilateral and 
commercial banks. There are still knowledge gaps about the form, 
structure and potential of these arrangements. They could be viewed 
as a form of a burden-sharing between high-, medium- and low-
income countries to enhance the deployment of ambitious Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) and new forms of ‘common but 
differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities’ (Edenhofer et 
al., 2015; Hourcade et al., 2015; Ji and Sha, 2015).  
4.5 
Integration and Enabling Transformation
4.5.1 
Assessing Feasibility of Options for Accelerated 
Transitions
Chapter 2 shows that 1.5°C-consistent pathways involve rapid, global 
climate responses to reach net zero emissions by mid-century or earlier. 
Chapter 3 identifies climate change risks and impacts to which the 
world would need to adapt during these transitions and additional risks 
and impacts during potential 1.5°C overshoot pathways. The feasibility 
of these pathways is contingent upon systemic change (Section 4.3) 
and enabling conditions (Section 4.4), including policy packages. This 
section assesses the feasibility of options (technologies, actions and 
measures) that form part of global systems under transition that make 
up 1.5°C-consistent pathways.
Following the assessment framework developed in Chapter 1, economic 
and technological, institutional and socio-cultural, and environmental and 
geophysical feasibility are considered and applied to system transitions 
(Sections 4.3.1–4.3.4), overarching adaptation options (Section 4.3.5) 
and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options (Section 4.3.7). This is done 
to assess the multidimensional feasibility of mitigation and adaptation 
options that have seen considerable development and change since 
AR5. In the case of adaptation, the assessed AR5 options are typically 
clustered. For example, all options related to energy infrastructure 
resilience, independently of the generation source, are categorized as 
‘resilience of power infrastructure’. 
Table 4.10 presents sets of indicators against which the multidimensional 
feasibility of individual adaptation options relevant to warming of 1.5°C, 
and mitigation options along 1.5°C-consistent pathways, is assessed. 
The feasibility assessment takes the following steps. First, each of 
the mitigation and adaptation options is assessed along the relevant 
indicators grouped around six feasibility dimensions: economic, 
technological, institutional, socio-cultural, environmental/ecological 
and geophysical. Three types of feasibility groupings were assessed 
from the underlying literature: first, if the indicator could block the 
feasibility of this option; second, if the indicator has neither a positive 
nor a negative effect on the feasibility of the option or the evidence 
is mixed; and third, if the indicator does not pose any barrier to the 
feasibility of this option. The full assessment of each option under each 
indicator, including the literature references on which the assessment 
is based, can be found in supplementary materials 4.SM.4.2 and 
4.SM.4.3. When appropriate, it is indicated that there is no evidence 
(NE), limited evidence (LE) or that the indicator is not applicable to the 
option (NA).  
Next, for each feasibility dimension and option, the overall feasibility 
for a given dimension is assessed as the mean of combined scores 
of the relevant underlying indicators and classified into ‘insignificant 
barriers’ (2.5 to 3), ‘mixed or moderate but still existent barriers’ (1.5 
to 2.5) or ‘significant barriers’ (below 1.5) to feasibility. Indicators 
assessed as NA, LE or NE are not included in this overall assessment 
(see supplementary material 4.SM.4.1 for the averaging and weighing 
guidance). 
The results are summarized in Table 4.11 (for mitigation options) 
and Table 4.12 (for adaptation options) for each of the six feasibility 
dimensions: where dark shading indicates few feasibility barriers; 
moderate shading indicates that there are mixed or moderate but still 
existent barriers, and light shading indicates that multiple barriers, in 
this dimension, may block implementation. 
A three-step process of independent validation and discussion by 
authors was undertaken to make this assessment as robust as possible 
within the scope of this Special Report. It must, however, be recognized 
that this is an indicative assessment at global scale, and both policy 
and implementation at regional, national and local level would need to 
adapt and build on this knowledge, within the particular local context 
and constraints. Some contextual factors are indicated in the rightmost 
column in Tables 4.11 and 4.12.

Implementing Mitigation
This section builds on the insights on mitigation options in Section 4.3, 
applies the assessment methodology along feasibility dimensions and 
indicators explained in Section 4.5.1, and synthesizes the assessment 
of the enabling conditions in Section 4.4. 
4.5.2.1 Assessing mitigation options for limiting warming 
to 1.5˚C against feasibility dimensions
An assessment of the degree to which examples of 1.5°C-relevant 
mitigation options face barriers to implementation, and on which 
contexts this depends, is summarized in Table 4.11. An explanation of 
the approach is given in Section 4.5.1 and in supplementary material 
4.SM.4.1. Selected options were mapped onto system transitions 
and clustered through an iterative process of literature review, 
expert feedback, and responses to reviewer comments. The detailed 
assessment and the literature underpinning the assessment can be 
found in supplementary material 4.SM.4.2.
The feasibility framework in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 highlights 
that the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options depends on 
many factors. Many of those are captured in the indicators in Table 4.10, 
but many depend on the specific context in which an option features. This 
Special Report did not have the mandate, space or the literature base 
to undertake a regionally specific assessment. Hence the assessment is 
caveated as providing a broad indication of the likely global barriers, 
ignoring significant regional diversity. Regional and context-specific 
literature is also just emerging as is noted in the knowledge gaps

section (Section 4.6). Nevertheless, in Table 4.11, an indicative attempt 
has been made to capture relevant contextual information. The ‘context’ 
column indicates which contextual factors may affect the feasibility of 
an option, including regional differences. For instance, solar irradiation 
in an area impacts the cost-effectiveness of solar photovoltaic energy, 
so solar irradiation is mentioned in this column.  
4.5.2.2 Enabling conditions for implementation 
of mitigation options towards 1.5˚C
The feasibility assessment highlights six dimensions that could help 
inform an agenda that could be addressed by the areas discussed in 
Section 4.4: governance, behaviour and lifestyles, innovation, enhancing 
institutional capacities, policy and finance. For instance, Section 4.4.3 on 
behaviour offers strategies for addressing public acceptance problems, 
and how changes can be more effective when communication and 
actions relate to people’s values. This section synthesizes the findings in 
Section 4.4 in an attempt to link them to the assessment in Table 4.11. 
The literature on which the discussion is based is found in Section 4.4.
From Section 4.4, including the case studies presented in the Boxes 
4.1 to 4.10, several main messages can be constructed. For instance, 
governance would have to be multilevel and engaging different actors, 
while being efficient, and choosing the form of cooperation based on 
the specific systemic challenge or option at hand. If institutional capacity 
for financing and governing the various transitions is not urgently built, 
many countries would lack the ability to change pathways from a 
high-emission scenario to a low- or zero-emission scenario. In terms of 
innovation, governments, both national and multilateral, can contribute

to applying general-purpose technologies to mitigation purposes. 
If this is not managed, some reduction in emissions could happen 
autonomously, but it may not lead to a 1.5°C-consistent pathway. 
International cooperation on technology, including technology transfer 
where this does not happen autonomously, is needed and can help 
create innovation capabilities in all countries that allow them to operate, 
maintain, adapt and regulate a portfolio of mitigation technologies. 
Case studies in the various subsections highlight the opportunities and 
challenges of doing this in practice. They indicate that it can be done in 
specific circumstances, which can be created. 
A combination of behaviour-oriented pricing policies and financing 
options can help change technologies and social behaviour as it would 
challenge the existing, high-emission socio-technical regime on multiple 
levels across feasibility characteristics. For instance, for dietary change, 
combining supply-side measures with value-driven communication and 
economic instruments may help make a lasting transition, while an 
economic instrument, such as enhanced prices or taxation, on its own 
may not be as robust. 
Governments could benefit from enhanced carbon prices, as a price and 
innovation incentive and also a source of additional revenue to correct 
distributional effects and subsidize the development of new, cost-
effective negative-emission technology and infrastructure. However, 
there is high evidence and medium agreement that pricing alone is 
insufficient. Even if prices rise significantly, they typically incentivize 
incremental change, but typically fail to provide the impetus for private 
actors to take the risk of engaging in the transformational changes 
that would be needed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Apart from the 
incentives to change behaviour and technology, financial systems are 
an indispensable element of a systemic transition. If financial markets 
do not acknowledge climate risk and the risk of transitions, regulatory 
financial institutions, such as central banks, could intervene. 
Strengthening implementation revolves around more than addressing 
barriers to feasibility. A system transition, be it in energy, industry, land 
or a city, requires changing the core parameters of a system. These relate, 
as introduced in Section 4.2 and further elaborated in Section 4.4, to 
how actors cooperate, how technologies are embedded, how resources 
are linked, how cultures relate and what values people associate with 
the transition and the current regime. 
4.5.3 
Implementing Adaptation
Article 7 of the Paris Agreement provides an aspirational global goal for 
adaptation, of ‘enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, 
and reducing vulnerability’ (UNFCCC, 2016). Adaptation implementation 
is gathering momentum in many regions, guided by national NDC’s and 
national adaptation plans (see Cross-Chapter Box 11 in this Chapter).
Operationalizing adaptation in a set of regional environments on 
pathways to a 1.5°C world requires strengthened global and differentiated 
regional and local capacities. It also needs rapid and decisive adaptation 
actions to reduce the costs and magnitude of potential climate impacts 
(Vergara et al., 2015). 
This could be facilitated by: (i) enabling conditions, especially improved 
governance, economic measures and financing (Section 4.4); (ii) 
384
Chapter 4

enhanced clarity on adaptation options to help identify strategic 
priorities, sequencing and timing of implementation (Section 4.3); 
(iii) robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks; and (iv) political 
leadership (Magnan et al., 2015; Magnan and Ribera, 2016; Lesnikowski 
et al., 2017; UNEP, 2017a). 
4.5.3.1 Feasible adaptation options
This section summarizes the feasibility (defined in Cross-Chapter Box 3, 
Table 1 in Chapter 1 and Table 4.4) of select adaptation options using 
evidence presented across this chapter and in supplementary material 
4.SM.4.3 and the expert-judgement of its authors (Table 4.12). The 
options assessed respond to risks and impacts identified in Chapter 3. 
They were selected based on options identified in AR5 (Noble et al., 
2014), focusing on those relevant to 1.5°C-compatible pathways, where 
sufficient literature exists. Selected options were mapped onto system 
transitions and clustered through an iterative process of literature 
review, expert feedback, and responses to reviewer comments.
Besides gaps in the literature around crucial adaptation questions 
on the transition to a 1.5°C world (Section 4.6), there is inadequate 
current literature to undertake a spatially differentiated assessment 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1). There are also limited baselines 
for exposure, vulnerability and risk to help policy and implementation 
prioritization. Hence, the compiled results can at best provide a broad 
framework to inform policymaking. Given the bottom-up nature of 
most adaptation implementation evidence, care needs to be taken in 
generalizing these findings. 
Options are considered as part of a systemic approach, recognizing that 
no single solution exists to limit warming to 1.5°C and adapting to its 
impacts. To respond to the local and regional context – and to synergies 
and trade-offs between adaptation, mitigation and sustainable 
development – packages of options suited to local enabling conditions 
can be implemented.
Table 4.12 summarizes the feasibility assessment through its six 
dimensions with levels of evidence and agreement and indicates how 
the feasibility of an adaptation option may be differentiated by certain 
contextual factors (last column). 
When considered jointly, the description of adaptation options (Section 
4.3), the feasibility assessment (summarized in Table 4.12), and 
discussion of enabling conditions (Section 4.4) show us how options 
can be implemented and lead towards transformational adaptation if 
and when needed.  
The adaptation options for energy system transitions focus on existing 
power infrastructure resilience and water management, when required, 
for any type of generation source. These options are not sufficient for 
the far-reaching transformations required in the energy sector, which 
have tended to focus on technologies to shift from a fossil-based to a 
renewable energy system (Erlinghagen and Markard, 2012; Muench 
et al., 2014; Brand and von Gleich, 2015; Monstadt and Wolff, 2015; 
Child and Breyer, 2017; Hermwille et al., 2017). There is also need for 
integration of such energy system transitions with social-ecological 
systems transformations to increase the resilience of the energy sector, 
for which appropriate enabling conditions, such as for technological 
innovations, are fundamentally important. Institutional capacities 
can be enhanced by expanding the role of actors as transformation 
catalysts (Erlinghagen and Markard, 2012). The integration of ethics 
and justice within these transformations can help attain SDG7 on clean 
energy access (Jenkins et al., 2018), while inclusion of the cultural 
dimension and cultural legitimacy (Amars et al., 2017) can provide a 
more substantial base for societal transformation. Strengthening policy 
instruments and regulatory frameworks and enhancing multilevel 
governance that focuses on resilience components can help secure 
these transitions (Exner et al., 2016).
For land and ecosystem transitions, the options of conservation 
agriculture, efficient irrigation, agroforestry, ecosystem restoration 
and avoided deforestation, and coastal defence and hardening have 
between medium and robust evidence with medium to high agreement. 
The other options assessed have limited or no evidence across one 
or more of the feasibility dimensions. Community-based adaptation 
is assessed as having medium evidence and high agreement to face 
scaling barriers. Scaling community-based adaptation may require 
structural changes, implying the need for transformational adaptation in 
some regions. This would involve enhanced multilevel governance and 
institutional capacities by enabling anticipatory and flexible decision-
making systems that access and develop collaborative networks 
(Dowd et al., 2014), tackling root causes of vulnerability (Chung Tiam 
Fook, 2017), and developing synergies between development and 
climate change (Burch et al., 2017). Case studies show the use of 
transformational adaptation approaches for fire management (Colloff 
et al., 2016a), floodplain and wetland management (Colloff et al., 
2016b), and forest management (Chung Tiam Fook, 2017), in which 
the strengthening of policy instruments and climate finance are also 
required.
There is growing recognition of the need for transformational 
adaptation within the agricultural sector but limited evidence on 
how to facilitate processes of deep, systemic change (Dowd et al., 
2014). Case studies demonstrate that transformational adaptation in 
agriculture requires a sequencing and overlap between incremental and 
transformational adaptation actions (Hadarits et al., 2017; Termeer et 
al., 2017), e.g., incremental improvements to crop management while 
new crop varieties are being researched and field-tested (Rippke et al., 
2016). Broader considerations include addressing stakeholder values 
and attitudes (Fleming et al., 2015a), understanding and leveraging the 
role of social capital, collaborative networks, and information (Dowd et 
al., 2014), and being inclusive with rural and urban communities, and 
the social, political, and cultural environment (Rickards and Howden, 
2012). Transformational adaptation in agriculture systems could have 
significant economic and institutional costs (Mushtaq, 2016), along with 
potential unintended negative consequences (Davidson, 2016; Rippke 
et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2018; Mushtaq, 2018),  and a need to focus 
on the transitional space between incremental and transformational 
adaptation (Hadarits et al., 2017), as well as the timing of the shift from 
one to the other (Läderach et al., 2017). 
Within urban and infrastructure transitions, green infrastructure and 
sustainable water management are assessed as the most feasible 
options, followed by sustainable land-use and urban planning. The

need for transformational adaptation in urban settings arises from the 
root causes of poverty, failures in sustainable development, and a lack 
of focus on social justice (Revi et al., 2014a; Parnell, 2015; Simon and 
Leck, 2015; Shi et al., 2016; Ziervogel et al., 2016a; Burch et al., 2017), 
and necessitates a focus on governance structures and the inclusion of 
equity and justice concerns (Bos et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2016; Hölscher 
et al., 2018). 
Current implementation of urban ecosystems-based adaptation (EbA) 
lacks a systems perspective of transformations and consideration of 
the normative and ethical aspects of EbA (Brink et al., 2016). Flexibility 
within urban planning could help deal with the multiple uncertainties 
of implementing adaptation (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014; 
Radhakrishnan et al., 2018), for example, urban adaptation pathways 
were implemented in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in New York, 
which is considered as tipping point that led to the implementation of 
transformational adaptation practices.
Adaptation options for industry focus on infrastructure resilience 
and water management. Like with energy system transitions, 
technological innovation would be required, but also the enhancement 
of institutional capacities. Recent research illustrates transformational 
adaptation within industrial transitions focusing on the role of 
different actors and tools driving innovation, and points to the role 
of nationally appropriate mitigation actions in avoiding lock-ins and 
promoting system innovation (Boodoo and Olsen, 2017), the role of 
private sector in sustainability governance in the socio-political context 
(Burch et al., 2016), and of green entrepreneurs driving transformative 
change in the green economy (Gibbs and O’Neill, 2014). Lim-Camacho 
et al. (2015) suggest an analysis of the complete lifecycle of supply 
chains as a means of identifying additional adaptation strategies, as 
opposed to the current focus on a part of the supply chain. Chain-wide 
strategies can modify the rest of the chain and present a win-win with 
commercial objectives.
The assessed adaptation options also have mitigation synergies 
and trade-offs (assessed in Section 4.5.4) that need to be carefully 
considered, while planning climate action. 
4.5.3.2 Monitoring and evaluation 
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) in adaptation implementation can 
promote accountability and transparency of adaptation financing, 
facilitate policy learning and sharing good practices, pressure laggards, 
and guide adaptation planning. The majority of research on M&E focuses 
on specific policies or programmes, and has typically been driven by 
the needs of development organizations, donors, and governments to 
measure the impact and attribution of adaptation initiatives (Ford and 
Berrang-Ford, 2016). There is growing research examining adaptation 
progress across nations, sectors, and scales (Reckien et al., 2014; Araos 
et al., 2016a, b; Austin et al., 2016; Heidrich et al., 2016; Lesnikowski et 
al., 2016; Robinson, 2017). In response to a need for global, regional 
and local adaptation, the development of indicators and standardized 
approaches to evaluate and compare adaptation over time and 
across regions, countries, and sectors would enhance comparability 
and learning. A number of constraints continue to hamper progress 
on adaptation M&E, including a debate on what actually constitutes 
adaptation for the purposes of assessing progress (Dupuis and 
Biesbroek, 2013; Biesbroek et al., 2015), an absence of comprehensive 
and systematically collected data on adaptation to support longitudinal 
assessment and comparison (Ford et al., 2015b; Lesnikowski et al., 
2016), a lack of agreement on indicators to measure (Brooks et al., 
2013; Bours et al., 2015; Lesnikowski et al., 2015), and challenges of 
attributing altered vulnerability to adaptation actions (Ford et al., 2013; 
Bours et al., 2015; UNEP, 2017a).
4.5.4 
Synergies and Trade-Offs between 
Adaptation and Mitigation
Implementing a particular mitigation or adaptation option may affect the 
feasibility and effectiveness of other mitigation and adaptation options. 
Supplementary Material 4.SM.5.1 provides examples of possible positive 
impacts (synergies) and negative impacts (trade-offs) of mitigation 
options for adaptation. For example, renewable energy sources such as 
wind energy and solar PV combined with electricity storage can increase 
resilience due to distributed grids, thereby enhancing both mitigation 
and adaptation. Yet, as another example, urban densification may reduce 
GHG emissions, enhancing mitigation, but can also intensify heat island 
effects and inhibit restoration of local ecosystems if not accounted for, 
thereby increasing adaptation challenges.
The table in Supplementary Material 4.SM.5.2 provides examples 
of synergies and trade-offs of adaptation options for mitigation. It 
shows, for example, that conservation agriculture can reduce some 
GHG emissions and thus enhance mitigation, but at the same time can 
increase other GHG emissions, thereby reducing mitigation potential. 
As another example, agroforestry can reduce GHG emissions through 
reduced deforestation and fossil fuel consumption but has a lower 
carbon sequestration potential compared with natural and secondary 
forest.
Maladaptive actions could increase the risk of adverse climate-related 
outcomes. For example, biofuel targets could lead to indirect land use 
change and influence local food security, through a shift in land use 
abroad in response to increased domestic biofuel demand, increasing 
global GHG emissions rather than decreasing them.
Various options enhance both climate change mitigation and 
adaptation, and would hence serve two 1.5°C-related goals: reducing 
emissions while adapting to the associated climate change. Examples 
of such options are reforestation, urban and spatial planning, and land 
and water management. 
Synergies between mitigation and adaptation may be enhanced, and 
trade-offs reduced, by considering enabling conditions (Section 4.4), 
while trade-offs can be amplified when enabling conditions are not 
considered (C.A. Scott et al., 2015). For example, information that 
is tailored to the personal situation of individuals and communities, 
including climate services that are credible and targeted at the point 
of decision-making, can enable and promote both mitigation and 
adaptation actions (Section 4.4.3). Similarly, multilevel governance 
and community participation, respectively, can enable and promote 
both adaptation and mitigation actions (Section 4.4.1). Governance, 
policies and institutions can facilitate the implementation of the water–

energy–food (WEF) nexus (Rasul and Sharma, 2016). The WEF nexus 
can enhance food, water and energy security, particularly in cities with 
agricultural production areas (Biggs et al., 2015), electricity generation 
with intensive water requirements (Conway et al 2015), and in 
agriculture (El Gafy et al., 2017) and livelihoods (Biggs et al., 2015). Such 
a nexus approach can reduce the transport energy that is embedded 
in food value chains (Villarroel Walker et al., 2014), providing diverse 
sources of food in the face of changing climates (Tacoli et al., 2013). 
Urban agriculture, where integrated, can mitigate climate change and 
support urban flood management (Angotti, 2015; Bell et al., 2015; Biggs 
et al., 2015; Gwedla and Shackleton, 2015; Lwasa et al., 2015; Yang 
et al., 2016; Sanesi et al., 2017). In the case of electricity generation, 
enabling conditions through a combination of carefully selected policy 
instruments can maximize the synergic benefits between low GHG 
energy production and water for energy (Shang et al., 2018). Despite 
the multiple benefits of maximizing synergies between mitigation 
and adaptations options through the WEF nexus approach (Chen and 
Chen, 2016), there are implementation challenges given institutional 
complexity, political economy, and interdependencies between actors 
(Leck et al., 2015).

domestic product, GDP) and maintaining its carbon neutrality. These goals increasingly interact and raise questions about whether 
they can be sustainably maintained into the future. Interventions in this enabling environment are required to comply with all three 
goals. 
Bhutan is well known for its GNHI, which is based on a variety of indicators covering psychological well-being, health, education, 
cultural and community vitality, living standards, ecological issues and good governance (RGoB, 2012; Schroeder and Schroeder, 
2014; Ura, 2015). The GNHI is a precursor to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (Allison, 2012; Brooks, 2013) and reflects 
local enabling environments. The GNHI has been measured twice, in 2010 and 2015, and this showed an increase of 1.8% (CBS & 
GNH, 2016). Like most emerging countries, Bhutan wants to increase its wealth and become a middle-income country (RGoB, 2013, 
2016), while remaining carbon-neutral – a goal which has been in place since 2009 at COP15 and was reiterated in its Intended 
Nationally Determined Contribution (NEC, 2015). Bhutan achieves its current carbon-neutral status through hydropower and forest 
cover (Yangka and Diesendorf, 2016), which are part of its resilience and adaptation strategy.
Nevertheless, Bhutan faces rising GHG emissions. Transport and industry are the largest growth areas (NEC, 2011). Bhutan’s carbon-
neutral status would be threatened by 2044 with business-as-usual approaches to economic growth (Yangka and Newman, 2018). 
Increases in hydropower are being planned based on climate change scenarios that suggest sufficient water supply will be available 
(NEC, 2011). Forest cover is expected to remain sufficient to maintain co-benefits. The biggest challenge is to electrify both freight 
and passenger transport (ADB, 2013). Bhutan wants to be a model for achieving economic growth consistent with limiting climate 
change to 1.5°C and improving its GNHI (Michaelowa et al., 2018) through synthesizing all three goals and improving its adaptive 
capacity.

Knowledge Gaps and Key Uncertainties
The global response to limiting warming to 1.5°C is a new knowledge 
area, which has emerged after the Paris Agreement. This section 
presents a number of knowledge gaps that have emerged from the 
assessment of mitigation, adaptation and carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) options and solar radiation modification (SRM) measures; 
enabling conditions; and synergies and trade-offs. Illustrative questions 
that emerge synthesizing the more comprehensive Table 4.13 below 
include: how much can be realistically expected from innovation, 
behaviour and systemic political and economic change in improving 
resilience, enhancing adaptation and reducing GHG emissions? 
How can rates of changes be accelerated and scaled up? What is 
the outcome of realistic assessments of mitigation and adaptation 
land transitions that are compliant with sustainable development, 
poverty eradication and addressing inequality? What are life-cycle 
emissions and prospects of early-stage CDR options? How can climate 
and sustainable development policies converge, and how can they 
be organized within a global governance framework and financial 
system, based on principles of justice and ethics (CBDR-RC), reciprocity 
and partnership? To what extent would limiting warming to 1.5°C 
require a harmonization of macro-financial and fiscal policies, which 
could include central banks? How can different actors and processes 
in climate governance reinforce each other, and hedge against the 
fragmentation of initiatives?
These knowledge gaps are highlighted in Table 4.13 along with a cross-
reference to the respective sections in the last column.

Systems
• The shift to variable renewables that many countries are  
   implementing is just reaching a level where large-scale  
   storage systems or other grid flexibility options, e.g., demand  
   response, are required to enable resilient grid systems. Thus,  
   new knowledge on the opportunities and issues associated  
   with scaling up zero-carbon grids would be needed, including  
   knowledge about how zero-carbon electric grids can integrate  
   with the full-scale electrification of transport systems
• CCS suffers mostly from uncertainty about the feasibility  
   of timely upscaling, both due to lack of regulatory capacity 
   and concerns about storage safety and cost
• There is not much literature on the distributional implications 
   of large-scale bioenergy deployment, the assessment of 
   environmental feasibility is hampered by a diversity of contexts 
   of individual studies (type of feedstock, technology, land 
   availability), which could be improved through emerging  
   meta-studies

   certain adaptation options, such as conservation agriculture 
   and shifting to efficient livestock systems 
• More knowledge is needed on the cost-effectiveness and  
   scalability of various adaptation options. For example, there

   by civil society, women and minorities
• Gaps in knowledge remain pertaining to partnerships within  
   local governance arrangements that may act as mediators  
   and drivers for achieving global ambition and local action
• Methods for assessing contribution and aggregation of 
   non-state actors in limiting warming to 1.5°C
• Knowledge gap on an enhanced framework for assessment 
   of the ambition of NDCs 
• The ability to identify explanatory factors affecting the progress  
   of climate policy is constrained by a lack of data on adaptation  
   actions across nations, regions, and sectors, compounded by an 
   absence of frameworks for assessing progress. Most  
   hypotheses on what drives adaptation remain untested 
• Limited empirical assessment of how governance affects 
   adaptation across cases

• There is a lack of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of adaptation measures, with most studies enumerating M&E challenges and 
   emphasising the importance of context and social learning. Very few studies evaluate whether and why an adaptation initiative 
   has been effective. One of the challenges of M&E for both mitigation and adaptation is a lack of high quality information for

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 4.1 | What Transitions could Enable Limiting Global Warming to 1.5°C?
Summary: In order to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world would need to transform 
in a number of complex and connected ways. While transitions towards lower greenhouse gas emissions are 
underway in some cities, regions, countries, businesses and communities, there are few that are currently 
consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Meeting this challenge would require a rapid escalation in the current 
scale and pace of change, particularly in the coming decades. There are many factors that affect the feasibility 
of different adaptation and mitigation options that could help limit warming to 1.5°C and with adapting to the 
consequences. 
There are actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This Special Report 
assesses energy, land and ecosystems, urban and infrastructure, and industry in developed and developing 
nations to see how they would need to be transformed to limit warming to 1.5°C. Examples of actions include 
shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet 
changes away from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure’, 
such as building green roofs, or improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the 
layout of many cities.
Because these different actions are connected, a ‘whole systems’ approach would be needed for the type of 
transformations that could limit warming to 1.5°C. This means that all relevant companies, industries and 
stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support and chance of successful implementation. As 
an illustration, the deployment of low-emission technology (e.g., renewable energy projects or a bio-based 
chemical plants) would depend upon economic conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilize 
investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness and acceptability) and institutional conditions 
(e.g., political support and understanding).
To limit warming to1.5°C, mitigation would have to be large-scale and rapid. Transitions can be transformative or 
incremental, and they often, but not always, go hand in hand. Transformative change can arise from growth in 
demand for a new product or market, such that it displaces an existing one. This is sometimes called ‘disruptive 
innovation’. For example, high demand for LED lighting is now making more energy-intensive, incandescent 
lighting near-obsolete, with the support of policy action that spurred rapid industry innovation. Similarly, smart 
phones have become global in use within ten years. But electric cars, which were released around the same 
time, have not been adopted so quickly because the bigger, more connected transport and energy systems are 
harder to change. Renewable energy, especially solar and wind, is considered to be disruptive by some as it 
is rapidly being adopted and is transitioning faster than predicted. But its demand is not yet uniform. Urban 
systems that are moving towards transformation are coupling solar and wind with battery storage and electric 
vehicles in a more incremental transition, though this would still require changes in regulations, tax incentives, 
new standards, demonstration projects and education programmes to enable markets for this system to work. 
Transitional changes are already underway in many systems, but limiting warming to 1.5°C would require a 
rapid escalation in the scale and pace of transition, particularly in the next 10–20 years. While limiting warming 
to 1.5°C would involve many of the same types of transitions as limiting warming to 2°C, the pace of change 
would need to be much faster. While the pace of change that would be required to limit warming to 1.5°C can 
be found in the past, there is no historical precedent for the scale of the necessary transitions, in particular in a 
socially and economically sustainable way. Resolving such speed and scale issues would require people’s support, 
public-sector interventions and private-sector cooperation.
Different types of transitions carry with them different associated costs and requirements for institutional or 
governmental support. Some are also easier to scale up than others, and some need more government support 
than others. Transitions between, and within, these systems are connected and none would be sufficient on its 
own to limit warming to 1.5°C. 
The ‘feasibility’ of adaptation and mitigation options or actions within each system that together can limit 
warming to 1.5°C within the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty requires careful 
consideration of multiple different factors. These factors include: (i) whether sufficient natural systems and 
resources are available to support the various options for transitioning (known as environmental feasibility); (ii) 
the degree to which the required technologies are developed and available (known as technological feasibility);

Chapter 4
(iii) the economic conditions and implications (known as economic feasibility); (iv) what are the implications for 
human behaviour and health (known as social/cultural feasibility); and (v) what type of institutional support would 
be needed, such as governance, institutional capacity and political support (known as institutional feasibility). 
An additional factor (vi – known as the geophysical feasibility) addresses the capacity of physical systems to carry 
the option, for example, whether it is geophysically possible to implement large-scale afforestation consistent 
with 1.5°C. 
Promoting enabling conditions, such as finance, innovation and behaviour change, would reduce barriers to the 
options, make the required speed and scale of the system transitions more likely, and therefore would increase 
the overall feasibility limiting warming to 1.5°C.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 4.2 | What are Carbon Dioxide Removal and Negative Emissions?
Summary: Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to the process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Since this is 
the opposite of emissions, practices or technologies that remove CO2 are often described as achieving ‘negative 
emissions’. The process is sometimes referred to more broadly as greenhouse gas removal if it involves removing 
gases other than CO2. There are two main types of CDR: either enhancing existing natural processes that remove 
carbon from the atmosphere (e.g., by increasing its uptake by trees, soil, or other ‘carbon sinks’) or using chemical 
processes to, for example, capture CO2 directly from the ambient air and store it elsewhere (e.g., underground). 
All CDR methods are at different stages of development and some are more conceptual than others, as they have 
not been tested at scale.
Limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require unprecedented rates of transformation 
in many areas, including in the energy and industrial sectors, for example. Conceptually, it is possible that 
techniques to draw CO2 out of the atmosphere (known as carbon dioxide removal, or CDR) could contribute to 
limiting warming to 1.5°C. One use of CDR could be to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from sectors 
that cannot completely decarbonize, or which may take a long time to do so. 
If global temperature temporarily overshoots 1.5°C, CDR would be required to reduce the atmospheric 
concentration of CO2 to bring global temperature back down. To achieve this temperature reduction, the amount 
of CO2 drawn out of the atmosphere would need to be greater than the amount entering the atmosphere, 
resulting in ‘net negative emissions’. This would involve a greater amount of CDR than stabilizing atmospheric 
CO2 concentration – and, therefore, global temperature – at a certain level. The larger and longer an overshoot, 
the greater the reliance on practices that remove CO2 from the atmosphere. 
There are a number of CDR methods, each with different potentials for achieving negative emissions, as well 
as different associated costs and side effects. They are also at differing levels of development, with some more 
conceptual than others. One example of a CDR method in the demonstration phase is a process known as 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), in which atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by plants and trees 
as they grow, and then the plant material (biomass) is burned to produce bioenergy. The CO2 released in the 
production of bioenergy is captured before it reaches the atmosphere and stored in geological formations deep 
underground on very long time scales. Since the plants absorb CO2 as they grow and the process does not emit 
CO2, the overall effect can be to reduce atmospheric CO2.
Afforestation (planting new trees) and reforestation (replanting trees where they previously existed) are also 
considered forms of CDR because they enhance natural CO2 ‘sinks’. Another category of CDR techniques uses 
chemical processes to capture CO2 from the air and store it away on very long time scales. In a process known 
as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), CO2 is extracted directly from the air and stored in geological 
formations deep underground. Converting waste plant material into a charcoal-like substance called biochar and 
burying it in soil can also be used to store carbon away from the atmosphere for decades to centuries. 
There can be beneficial side effects of some types of CDR, other than removing CO2 from the atmosphere. For 
example, restoring forests or mangroves can enhance biodiversity and protect against flooding and storms. But 
there could also be risks involved with some CDR methods. For example, deploying BECCS at large scale would 
require a large amount of land to cultivate the biomass required for bioenergy. This could have consequences 
for sustainable development if the use of land competes with producing food to support a growing population, 
biodiversity conservation or land rights. There are also other considerations. For example, there are uncertainties 
about how much it would cost to deploy DACCS as a CDR technique, given that removing CO2 from the air 
requires considerable energy.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 4.3 | Why is Adaptation Important in a 1.5°C-Warmer World? 
Summary: Adaptation is the process of adjusting to current or expected changes in climate and its effects. Even 
though climate change is a global problem, its impacts are experienced differently across the world. This means 
that responses are often specific to the local context, and so people in different regions are adapting in different 
ways. A rise in global temperature from the current 1°C above pre-industrial levels to 1.5°C, and beyond, increases 
the need for adaptation. Therefore, stabilizing global temperatures at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would 
require a smaller adaptation effort than at 2°C. Despite many successful examples around the world, progress in 
adaptation is, in many regions, in its infancy and unevenly distributed globally. 
Adaptation refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected changes in climate and its effects. Since 
different parts of the world are experiencing the impacts of climate change differently, there is similar diversity 
in how people in a given region are adapting to those impacts. 
The world is already experiencing the impacts from 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, and there 
are many examples of adaptation to impacts associated with this warming. Examples of adaptation efforts taking 
place around the world include investing in flood defences such as building sea walls or restoring mangroves, 
efforts to guide development away from high risk areas, modifying crops to avoid yield reductions, and using 
social learning (social interactions that change understanding on the community level) to modify agricultural 
practices, amongst many others. Adaptation also involves building capacity to respond better to climate change 
impacts, including making governance more flexible and strengthening financing mechanisms, such as by 
providing different types of insurance. 
In general, an increase in global temperature from present day to 1.5°C or 2°C (or higher) above pre-industrial 
temperatures would increase the need for adaptation. Stabilizing global temperature increase at 1.5°C would 
require a smaller adaptation effort than for 2°C. 
Since adaptation is still in early stages in many regions, there are questions about the capacity of vulnerable 
communities to cope with any amount of further warming. Successful adaptation can be supported at 
the national and sub-national levels, with national governments playing an important role in coordination, 
planning, determining policy priorities, and distributing resources and support. However, given that the need 
for adaptation can be very different from one community to the next, the kinds of measures that can successfully 
reduce climate risks will also depend heavily on the local context. 
When done successfully, adaptation can allow individuals to adjust to the impacts of climate change in ways that 
minimize negative consequences and to maintain their livelihoods. This could involve, for example, a farmer 
switching to drought-tolerant crops to deal with increasing occurrences of heatwaves. In some cases, however, 
the impacts of climate change could result in entire systems changing significantly, such as moving to an entirely 
new agricultural system in areas where the climate is no longer suitable for current practices. Constructing 
sea walls to stop flooding due to sea level rise from climate change is another example of adaptation, but 
developing city planning to change how flood water is managed throughout the city would be an example 
of transformational adaptation. These actions require significantly more institutional, structural, and financial 
support. While this kind of transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a 1.5°C world, the 
scale of change needed would be challenging to implement, as it requires additional support, such as through 
financial assistance and behavioural change. Few empirical examples exist to date.
Examples from around the world show that adaptation is an iterative process. Adaptation pathways describe 
how communities can make decisions about adaptation in an ongoing and flexible way. Such pathways allow 
for pausing, evaluating the outcomes of specific adaptation actions, and modifying the strategy as appropriate. 
Due to their flexible nature, adaptation pathways can help to identify the most effective ways to minimise the 
impacts of present and future climate change for a given local context. This is important since adaptation can 
sometimes exacerbate vulnerabilities and existing inequalities if poorly designed. The unintended negative 
consequences of adaptation that can sometimes occur are known as ‘maladaptation’. Maladaptation can be seen 
if a particular adaptation option has negative consequences for some (e.g., rainwater harvesting upstream might 
reduce water availability downstream) or if an adaptation intervention in the present has trade-offs in the future 
(e.g., desalination plants may improve water availability in the present but have large energy demands over time).

Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response 
Chapter 4
While adaptation is important to reduce the negative impacts from climate change, adaptation measures on 
their own are not enough to prevent climate change impacts entirely. The more global temperature rises, the 
more frequent, severe, and erratic the impacts will be, and adaptation may not protect against all risks. Examples 
of where limits may be reached include substantial loss of coral reefs, massive range losses for terrestrial species, 
more human deaths from extreme heat, and losses of coastal-dependent livelihoods in low lying islands and 
coasts.

FAQ 4.3, Figure 1 |  Why is adaptation important in a world with global warming of 1.5°C? Examples of adaptation and transformational adaptation. 
Adapting to further warming requires action at national and sub-national levels and can mean different things to different people in different contexts. While 
transformational adaptation would not be needed everywhere in a world limited to 1.5°C warming, the scale of change needed would be challenging to implement.
