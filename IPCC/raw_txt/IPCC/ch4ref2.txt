Based on a review of other energy systems (e.g., ARC, 1980), a linear relationship
between digestible energy and net energy was derived for digestibilities below 65 per cent
as follows (see Appendix C):
EQUATION 11
NE/DE
=  0.298 + (0.00335 x DE%)
EQUATION 12
NEg/DE
= -0.036 + (0.00535 x DE%)
Given the estimates for feed digestibility (from Step 1) and equations 9 through 12, the
gross energy intake (GE in MJ/day) can be estimated as follows:

where:
{NE/DE} is computed from equation 9 for digestibility greater than 65 per cent and
from equation 11 for digestibility less than or equal to 65 per cent;
{NEg/DE} is computed from equation 10 for digestibility greater than 65 per cent and
from equation 12 for digestibility less than or equal to 65 per cent; and
DE% is digestibility in per cent (e.g., 60%).
To check the estimate of daily gross energy intake from Equation 13, the estimate can be
converted in daily intake in kilograms by dividing by 18.45 MJ/kg.  This estimate of intake
in kilograms should generally be between 1.5 per cent and 3.0 per cent of the animal's
weight.
Using Equation 13 and the cattle data summarised in Appendix A, Gibbs and Johnson
(1993) found that the intake estimates are consistent with expected intakes as a
percentage of body weight and previously published values.  For example, the intake
estimate for Indian cattle is the equivalent of about 10,000 MJ per year of metabolisable
energy (ME).  Winrock (1978) estimates the average ME requirements for Indian cattle at
10,600 MJ per year.  Similarly, the ME values implied for U.S.A dairy and non-dairy cows
are 58,000 MJ and 31,000 MJ per year, respectively, which are similar to estimates of
62,000 MJ and 31,700 MJ derived in US EPA (1993).  Consequently, for a diverse set of
conditions, the intake estimates correspond to reasonably expected ranges from
previously published estimates.

To estimate the emission factor for each cattle type, the feed intake is multiplied by the
methane conversion rate (from Step 1) as follows:
EQUATION 14
Emissions (kg/yr) = [Intake (MJ/day) x Ym x (365 days/yr)] / [55.65 MJ/kg of
methane]
where Ym is the methane conversion rate expressed in decimal form (such as 0.06 for
6 per cent).  The result of this step of the method is an emission factor for each cattle
type defined in Step 1.

To estimate total emissions the selected emission factors are multiplied by the associated
animal population and summed.  As described above under Tier 1, the emissions
estimates should be reported in gigagrams (Gg).

The Tier 2 approach provides a more detailed method for estimating methane emissions
from manure management systems.  The Tier 2 approach is recommended for countries
with large cattle, buffalo and swine populations managed under confined conditions.
Compared to the Tier 1 approach, this method requires additional detailed information
on animal characteristics and the manner in which manure is managed.  Using this
additional information, emission factors are estimated that are specific to the conditions
of the country, and the default emission factors from Tier 1 are not used.
The Tier 2 approach is similar to the original OECD method described in OECD (1991).
Improvements to the method have been made to incorporate more recent figures on
methane conversion factors and to link the method more closely to the animal
characteristic data collected for estimating enteric fermentation.

To develop precise estimates of emissions, the animals should be divided into relatively
homogeneous groups.  For each category a representative animal is chosen and
characterised for purposes of estimating an emission factor.  Suggested categories for
cattle are discussed above under the enteric fermentation Tier 2 method and are
summarised in Table 4-7.  Similar categories can be used for buffalo.  Categories for
swine could include sows, boars, and growing animals (farrows to finishers).  For each of
the representative animal types defined, the following information is required:
•
annual average population (number of head) by climate region (cool, temperate, and
warm);
•
average daily volatile solids (VS) excretion (kg of dry matter per day);11
                                                  
     11 Volatile solids (VS) are the degradable organic material in livestock manure.

•
methane-producing potential (Bo) of the manure (cubic metres (m3) of methane per
kg of VS);
•
manure management system usage (percentage of manure managed with each
management system).
Population data are generally available from country-specific livestock census reports.  As
described above under Tier 1, the portion of each animal population in cool, temperate,
and warm climate regions is required.
Often, data on average daily VS excretion are not available.  Consequently, the VS values
may need to be estimated from feed intake levels.  The enteric fermentation Tier 2
method should be used to estimate feed intake levels for cattle and buffalo.12  For swine,
country-specific swine production data may be required to estimate feed intake.  To
develop the default emission factors for swine presented in Tier 1, average feed intake
estimates for swine in developed and developing countries were used from Crutzen et al.
(1986) (see Appendix B, at the end of this section).
Once feed intake is estimated, the VS excretion rate is estimated as:13
EQUATION 15
VS (kg dm/day) = Intake (MJ/day) x (1 kg/18.45 MJ) x (1 - DE%/100) x
(1-ASH%/100)
where:
VS
=
VS excretion per day on a dry weight basis;
dm
=
dry matter;
Intake
=
the estimated daily average feed intake in MJ/day;
DE%
=
the digestibility of the feed in per cent (e.g., 60%);
ASH%
=
the ash content of the manure in per cent (e.g., 8%).
For cattle, the DE% value used should be the same value used to implement Tier 2 for
enteric fermentation.  The ash content of cattle and buffalo manure is generally around
8 per cent.  For swine, the default emission factors were estimated using 75 per cent and
50 per cent digestibility for developed and developing countries, respectively, and an ash
content of 2 per cent and 4 per cent for developed and developing countries,
respectively.  Appendix B summarises the data used to estimate the VS excretion rates
for cattle, buffalo, and swine.
The maximum methane-producing capacity for the manure (Bo) varies by species and diet.
Country-specific data should be used where feasible.  A range of representative Bo values
                                                  
     12 By using the enteric fermentation Tier 2 method to estimate feed intake,
consistency is assured in the data underlying the emissions estimates for both enteric
fermentation and manure management.
     13 The energy density of feed is about 18.45 MJ per kg of dry matter.  This value is
relatively constant across a wide range of forage and grain-based feeds commonly
consumed by livestock.

The portion of manure managed in each manure management system must also be
collected for each representative animal type.  Table 4-8 summarises the main types of
manure management systems.  The first four types in the table, pasture, daily spread, solid
storage, and drylot, are all dry manure management systems.  These systems produce
little or no methane.  The wet manure management systems, liquid/slurry, anaerobic
lagoon, and pit storage, are the primary sources of manure methane emissions.  To
implement this Tier 2 method, at a minimum the proportion of manure managed in wet
and dry systems must be estimated.

Emission factors are estimated for each animal type based using the data collected in
Step 1 and the methane conversion factors (MCFs) for each manure management system.
The MCF defines the portion of the methane producing potential (Bo) that is achieved.
The MCF varies by manure management system and climate and can range between 0 and
100 per cent.  Table 4-8 presents the latest available MCF estimates for the major
manure management systems that have been developed.
To calculate the emission factor for each animal type, a weighted average methane
conversion factor (MCF) is calculated using the estimates of the manure managed by
waste system within each climate region.  The average MCF is then multiplied by the VS
excretion rate and the Bo for the animal type.  In equation form, the estimate is as
follows:
EQUATION 16
EFi = VSi x 365 days/yr x Boi x 0.67 kg/m3 x

The default values used in the Tier 1 and 2 methods were derived from available livestock
and manure management data and are generally representative of regional conditions.
Because livestock and manure management conditions can vary significantly across and
within countries, the default values may not reflect adequately the conditions in a given
country.  Additionally, the variability of conditions has not been well characterised to
date.
The emissions estimates can be improved by going beyond the Tier 2 default data and
collecting key country- or region-specific data.  Data elements that would benefit from
data collection initiatives (such as targeted surveys of major livestock types) include the
following:
•
Cattle weight
In many regions the weights of cattle are not well quantified.

•
Feed intake
Field data on feed intake would be valuable for validating the feed intake estimates
made under Tier 2 for cattle.
•
Manure production
Field data on manure production by livestock would be valuable for validating the
manure production estimates made under Tier 2.
•
Manure management
Field data on manure management system usage would improve the basis for making
the estimates.  Considerations of seasonal management practices could be
incorporated into the data.
In addition to these data collection initiatives, measurement programmes can be used to
improve the basis for making the estimates.  In particular, measurements of emissions
from manure management systems under field conditions is needed.  Techniques for
making these measurements are described in IAEA (1992).  Additionally, measurements of
the maximum methane producing ability of manure (Bo) from livestock in tropical regions
is needed.
Additionally, new techniques are being deployed to measure emissions from cattle under
field conditions (Johnson et al., 1993).  Using these techniques, coefficients used in Tier 2
can be verified (such as the methane conversion rate) and the emissions estimates can be
validated.  Targeted assessments of tropical cattle populations would be most valuable.

The method for estimating N2O emissions from manure management is described in
detail in Section 4.5.3 of this Reference Manual, where emissions from several animal
waste management systems are considered.  All emissions of N2O taking place before the
manure is added to soils are to be reported under ‘’Manure Management’’.  These include
emissions from anaerobic lagoons, liquid systems, solid storage and drylot, and ‘’other
systems’’.   Emissions resulting from manure used for fuel are included in the Energy
Chapter.  All manure-induced soil emissions are considered soil emissions here.

Appendix B
Data Underlying Methane Default Emission
Factors for Manure Management
This appendix presents the data used to develop the default emission factors for methane
emissions from manure management.  The detailed information presented for cattle and
buffalo was developed in Gibbs and Johnson (1993).  The swine feed intake data are from
Crutzen et al. (1986).  The manure management system usage data and Bo estimates are
from Safley et al. (1992).  The methane conversion factor (MCF) data are from
Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993).  The Tier 2 method was implemented with these data
to estimate the default emission factors for cattle, buffalo, and swine.  Also presented are
the summary feed intake data from Crutzen et al. (1986) and the manure-related data
from Safley et al. (1992) and Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993) that were used to
estimate the emission factors for the other species.
