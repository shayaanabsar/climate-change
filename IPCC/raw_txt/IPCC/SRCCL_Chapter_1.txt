Executive summary
Land, including its water bodies, provides the basis for human 
livelihoods and well-being through primary productivity, the 
supply of food, freshwater, and multiple other ecosystem 
services (high confidence). Neither our individual or societal 
identities, nor the world’s economy would exist without the 
multiple resources, services and livelihood systems provided by 
land ecosystems and biodiversity. The annual value of the world’s 
total terrestrial ecosystem services has been estimated at 75 trillion 
USD in 2011, approximately equivalent to the annual global Gross 
Domestic Product (based on USD2007 values) (medium confidence). 
Land and its biodiversity also represent essential, intangible benefits 
to humans, such as cognitive and spiritual enrichment, sense of 
belonging and aesthetic and recreational values. Valuing ecosystem 
services with monetary methods often overlooks these intangible 
services that shape societies, cultures and quality of life and the 
intrinsic value of biodiversity. The Earth’s land area is finite. Using 
land resources sustainably is fundamental for human well-being 
(high confidence). {1.1.1}
The current geographic spread of the use of land, the large 
appropriation of multiple ecosystem services and the loss 
of biodiversity are unprecedented in human history (high 
confidence). By 2015, about three-quarters of the global ice-free 
land surface was affected by human use. Humans appropriate 
one-quarter to one-third of global terrestrial potential net primary 
production (high confidence). Croplands cover 12–14% of the 
global ice-free surface. Since 1961, the supply of global per capita 
food calories increased by about one-third, with the consumption 
of vegetable oils and meat more than doubling. At the same time, 
the use of inorganic nitrogen fertiliser increased by nearly ninefold, 
and the use of irrigation water roughly doubled (high confidence). 
Human use, at varying intensities, affects about 60–85% of forests 
and 70–90% of other natural ecosystems (e.g., savannahs, natural 
grasslands) (high confidence). Land use caused global biodiversity to 
decrease by around 11–14% (medium confidence). {1.1.2}
Warming over land has occurred at a  faster rate than the 
global mean and this has had observable impacts on the land 
system (high confidence). The average temperature over land 
for the period 2006–2015 was  1.53°C higher than for the period 
1850–1900, and  0.66°C larger than the equivalent global mean 
temperature change. These warmer temperatures (with changing 
precipitation patterns) have altered the start and end of growing 
seasons, contributed to regional crop yield reductions, reduced 
freshwater availability, and put biodiversity under further stress 
and increased tree mortality (high confidence). Increasing levels of 
atmospheric CO2, have contributed to observed increases in plant 
growth as well as to increases in woody plant cover in grasslands 
and savannahs (medium confidence). {1.1.2}
Urgent action to stop and reverse the over-exploitation of 
land resources would buffer the negative impacts of multiple 
pressures, including climate change, on ecosystems and society 
(high confidence). Socio-economic drivers of land-use change such 
as technological development, population growth and increasing 
per capita demand for multiple ecosystem services are projected to 
continue into the future (high confidence). These and other drivers 
can amplify existing environmental and societal challenges, such 
as the conversion of natural ecosystems into managed land, rapid 
urbanisation, pollution from the intensification of land management 
and equitable access to land resources (high confidence). Climate 
change will add to these challenges through direct, negative impacts 
on ecosystems and the services they provide (high confidence). Acting 
immediately and simultaneously on these multiple drivers would 
enhance food, fibre and water security, alleviate desertification, and 
reverse land degradation, without compromising the non-material or 
regulating benefits from land (high confidence). {1.1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3.2–
1.3.6, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Rapid reductions in anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions that restrict warming to “well-below” 2°C would 
greatly reduce the negative impacts of climate change on land 
ecosystems (high confidence). In the absence of rapid emissions 
reductions, reliance on large-scale, land-based, climate change 
mitigation is projected to increase, which would aggravate 
existing pressures on land (high confidence). Climate change 
mitigation efforts that require large land areas (e.g., bioenergy and 
afforestation/reforestation) are projected to compete with existing 
uses of land (high confidence). The competition for land could 
increase food prices and lead to further intensification (e.g., fertiliser 
and water use) with implications for water and air pollution, and the 
further loss of biodiversity (medium confidence). Such consequences 
would jeopardise societies’ capacity to achieve many Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) that depend on land (high confidence). 
{1.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}
Nonetheless, there are many land-related climate change 
mitigation options that do not increase the competition for 
land (high confidence). Many of these options have co-benefits 
for climate change adaptation (medium confidence). Land use 
contributes about one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, 
notably CO2 emissions from deforestation, CH4 emissions from rice 
and ruminant livestock and N2O emissions from fertiliser use (high 
confidence). Land ecosystems also take up large amounts of carbon 
(high confidence). Many land management options exist to both 
reduce the magnitude of emissions and enhance carbon uptake. These 
options enhance crop productivity, soil nutrient status, microclimate 
or biodiversity, and thus, support adaptation to climate change (high 
confidence). In addition, changes in consumer behaviour, such as 
reducing the over-consumption of food and energy would benefit the 
reduction of GHG emissions from land (high confidence). The barriers 
to the implementation of mitigation and adaptation options include 
skills deficit, financial and institutional barriers, absence of incentives, 
access to relevant technologies, consumer awareness and the limited 
spatial scale at which the success of these practices and methods 
have been demonstrated. {1.2.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.3.4, 1.3.5, 1.3.6}
Sustainable food supply and food consumption, based on 
nutritionally balanced and diverse diets, would enhance 
food security under climate and socio-economic changes 
(high confidence). Improving food access, utilisation, quality and 
safety to enhance nutrition, and promoting globally equitable diets

compatible with lower emissions have demonstrable positive impacts 
on land use and food security (high confidence). Food security is also 
negatively affected by food loss and waste (estimated as 25–30% of 
total food produced) (medium confidence). Barriers to improved food 
security include economic drivers (prices, availability and stability of 
supply) and traditional, social and cultural norms around food eating 
practices. Climate change is expected to increase variability in food 
production and prices globally (high confidence), but the trade in food 
commodities can buffer these effects. Trade can provide embodied 
flows of water, land and nutrients (medium confidence). Food 
trade can also have negative environmental impacts by displacing 
the effects of overconsumption (medium confidence). Future food 
systems and trade patterns will be shaped as much by policies as by 
economics (medium confidence). {1.2.1, 1.3.3}
A gender-inclusive approach offers opportunities to enhance 
the sustainable management of land (medium confidence). 
Women play a  significant role in agriculture and rural economies 
globally. In many world regions, laws, cultural restrictions, patriarchy 
and social structures such as discriminatory customary laws and norms 
reduce women’s capacity in supporting the sustainable use of land 
resources (medium confidence). Therefore, acknowledging women’s 
land rights and bringing women’s land management knowledge into 
land-related decision-making would support the alleviation of land 
degradation, and facilitate the take-up of integrated adaptation and 
mitigation measures (medium confidence). {1.4.1, 1.4.2}
Regional and country specific contexts affect the capacity to 
respond to climate change and its impacts, through adaptation 
and mitigation (high confidence). There is large variability in the 
availability and use of land resources between regions, countries and 
land management systems. In addition, differences in socio-economic 
conditions, such as wealth, degree of industrialisation, institutions 
and governance, affect the capacity to respond to climate change, 
food insecurity, land degradation and desertification. The capacity 
to respond is also strongly affected by local land ownership. Hence, 
climate change will affect regions and communities differently (high 
confidence). {1.3, 1.4}
Cross-scale, cross-sectoral and inclusive governance can 
enable coordinated policy that supports effective adaptation 
and mitigation (high confidence). There is a lack of coordination 
across governance levels, for example, local, national, transboundary 
and international, in addressing climate change and sustainable 
land management challenges. Policy design and formulation is often 
strongly sectoral, which poses further barriers when integrating 
international decisions into relevant (sub)national policies. 
A portfolio of policy instruments that are inclusive of the diversity 
of governance actors would enable responses to complex land and 
climate challenges (high confidence). Inclusive governance that 
considers women’s and indigenous people’s rights to access and use 
land enhances the equitable sharing of land resources, fosters food 
security and increases the existing knowledge about land use, which 
can increase opportunities for adaptation and mitigation (medium 
confidence). {1.3.5, 1.4.1, 1.4.2, 1.4.3}
Scenarios and models are important tools to explore the 
trade-offs and co-benefits of land management decisions 
under uncertain futures (high confidence). Participatory, 
co-creation processes with stakeholders can facilitate the use of 
scenarios in designing future sustainable development strategies 
(medium confidence). In addition to qualitative approaches, models 
are critical in quantifying scenarios, but uncertainties in models arise 
from, for example, differences in baseline datasets, land cover classes 
and modelling paradigms (medium confidence). Current scenario 
approaches are limited in quantifying time-dependent policy and 
management decisions that can lead from today to desirable futures 
or visions. Advances in scenario analysis and modelling are needed to 
better account for full environmental costs and non-monetary values 
as part of human decision-making processes. {1.2.2, Cross-Chapter

Introduction and scope of the report
1.1.1 
Objectives and scope of the assessment
Land, including its water bodies, provides the basis for our livelihoods 
through basic processes such as net primary production that 
fundamentally sustain the supply of food, bioenergy and freshwater, 
and the delivery of multiple other ecosystem services and biodiversity 
(Hoekstra and Wiedmann 2014; Mace et al.  2012; Newbold 
et al. 2015; Runting et al. 2017; Isbell et al. 2017) (Cross-Chapter 
Box 8 in Chapter 6). The annual value of the world’s total terrestrial 
ecosystem services has been estimated to be about 75 trillion 
USD in 2011, approximately equivalent to the annual global Gross 
Domestic Product (based on USD2007 values) (Costanza et al. 2014; 
IMF 2018). Land also supports non-material ecosystem services 
such as cognitive and spiritual enrichment and aesthetic values 
(Hernández-Morcillo et al. 2013; Fish et al. 2016), intangible services 
that shape societies, cultures and human well-being. Exposure of 
people living in cities to (semi-)natural environments has been found 
to decrease mortality, cardiovascular disease and depression (Rook 
2013; Terraube et al. 2017). Non-material and regulating ecosystem 
services have been found to decline globally and rapidly, often at 
the expense of increasing material services (Fischer et al.  2018; 
IPBES 2018a). Climate change will exacerbate diminishing land and 
freshwater resources, increase biodiversity loss, and will intensify 
societal vulnerabilities, especially in regions where economies are 
highly dependent on natural resources. Enhancing food security and 
reducing malnutrition, whilst also halting and reversing desertification 
and land degradation, are fundamental societal challenges that are 
increasingly aggravated by the need to both adapt to and mitigate 
climate change impacts without compromising the non-material 
benefits of land (Kongsager et al. 2016; FAO et al. 2018).
Annual emissions of GHGs and other climate forcers continue to 
increase unabatedly. Confidence is very high that the window of 
opportunity, the period when significant change can be made, 
for limiting climate change within tolerable boundaries is rapidly 
narrowing (Schaeffer et al.  2015; Bertram et al.  2015; Riahi 
et al. 2015; Millar et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a). The Paris Agreement 
formulates the goal of limiting global warming this century to well 
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, for which rapid actions are 
required across the energy, transport, infrastructure and agricultural 
sectors, while factoring in the need for these sectors to accommodate 
a growing human population (Wynes and Nicholas 2017; Le Quere 
et al.  2018). Conversion of natural land, and land management, 
are significant net contributors to GHG emissions and climate 
change, but land ecosystems are also a GHG sink (Smith et al. 2014; 
Tubiello et al. 2015; Le Quere et al. 2018; Ciais et al. 2013a). It is 
not surprising, therefore, that land plays a prominent role in many 
of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of the parties to 
the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; Grassi et al. 2017; Forsell 
et al.  2016), and land-measures will be part of the NDC review 
by 2023.
A range of different climate change mitigation and adaptation 
options on land exist, which differ in terms of their environmental 
and societal implications (Meyfroidt 2018; Bonsch et al. 2016; Crist 
et al.  2017; Humpenoder et al.  2014; Harvey and Pilgrim 2011; 
Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2015; Sanz-Sanchez et al. 2017; 
Pereira et al.  2010; Griscom et al.  2017; Rogelj et al.  2018a) 
(Chapters 4–6). The Special Report on climate change, desertification, 
land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and 
GHG fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL) synthesises the current 
state of scientific knowledge on the issues specified in the report’s 
title (Figure 1.1 and Figure 1.2). This knowledge is assessed in the 
context of the Paris Agreement, but many of the SRCCL issues 
concern other international conventions such as the United Nations 
Convention on Biodiversity (UNCBD), the UN Convention to Combat 
Desertification (UNCCD), the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction (UNISDR) and the UN Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The SRCCL is the first report in which 
land is the central focus since the IPCC Special Report on land use, 
land-use change and forestry (Watson et al. 2000) (Box 1.1). The main 
objectives of the SRCCL are to:
1. Assess the current state of the scientific knowledge on the 
impacts of socio-economic drivers and their interactions with 
climate change on land, including degradation, desertification 
and food security;
2. Evaluate the feasibility of different land-based response options 
to GHG mitigation, and assess the potential synergies and 
trade-offs with ecosystem services and sustainable development;
3. Examine adaptation options under a changing climate to tackle 
land degradation and desertification and to build resilient food 
systems, as well as evaluating the synergies and trade-offs 
between mitigation and adaptation; 
4. Delineate the policy, governance and other enabling conditions 
to support climate mitigation, land ecosystem resilience and 
food security in the context of risks, uncertainties and remaining 
knowledge gaps.

Figure 1.1 (continued):  A. The warming curves are averages of four datasets (Section 2.1, Figure 2.2 and Table 2.1). B. N2O and CH4 from agriculture are from FAOSTAT; Net 
land-use change emissions of CO2 from forestry and other land use (including emissions from peatland fires since 1997) are from the annual Global Carbon Budget, using the 
mean of two bookkeeping models. All values expressed in units of CO2-eq are based on AR5 100-year Global Warming Potential values without climate-carbon feedbacks (N2O 
= 265; CH4 = 28) (Table SPM.1 and Section 2.3). C. Depicts shares of different uses of the global, ice-free land area for approximately the year 2015, ordered along a gradient of 
decreasing land-use intensity from left to right. Each bar represents a broad land cover category; the numbers on top are the total percentage of the ice-free area covered, with 
uncertainty ranges in brackets. Intensive pasture is defined as having a livestock density greater than 100 animals/km2. The area of ‘forest managed for timber and other uses’ 
was calculated as total forest area minus ‘primary/intact’ forest area. (Section 1.2, Table 1.1, Figure 1.3). D. Note that fertiliser use is shown on a split axis (source: International 
Fertiliser Industry Association, www.ifastat.org/databases). The large percentage change in fertiliser use reflects the low level of use in 1961 and relates to both increasing 
fertiliser input per area as well as the expansion of fertilised cropland and grassland to increase food production (1.1, Figure 1.3). E. Overweight population is defined as having 
a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg m–2 (source: Abarca-Gómez et al. 2017); underweight is defined as BMI <18.5 kg m–2. (Population density, source: United Nations, Department 
of Economic and Social Affairs 2017) (Sections 5.1 and 5.2). F. Dryland areas were estimated using TerraClimate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (1980–2015) 
(Abatzoglou et al. 2018) to identify areas where the Aridity Index is below 0.65. Areas experiencing human caused desertification, after accounting for precipitation variability 
and CO2 fertilisation, are identified in Le et al. 2016. Population data for these areas were extracted from the gridded historical population database HYDE3.2 (Goldewijk 
et al. 2017). Areas in drought are based on the 12-month accumulation Global Precipitation Climatology Centre Drought Index (Ziese et al. 2014). The area in drought was 
calculated for each month (Drought Index below –1), and the mean over the year was used to calculate the percentage of drylands in drought that year. The inland wetland 
extent (including peatlands) is based on aggregated data from more than 2000 time series that report changes in local wetland area over time (Dixon et al. 2016; Darrah 
et al. 2019) (Sections 3.1, 4.2 and 4.6).
The SRCCL identifies and assesses land-related challenges and 
response options in an integrative way, aiming to be policy relevant 
across sectors. Chapter  1  provides a  synopsis of the main issues 
addressed in this report, which are explored in more detail in 
Chapters  2–7. Chapter  1  also introduces important concepts and 
definitions and highlights discrepancies with previous reports that 
arise from different objectives (a full set of definitions is provided 
in the Glossary). Chapter 2 focuses on the natural system dynamics, 
assessing recent progress towards understanding the impacts of 
climate change on land, and the feedbacks arising from altered 
biogeochemical and biophysical exchange fluxes (Figure  1.2 |   
Overview over the SRCCL.1.2).

Previous IPCC reports have made reference to land and its role in the climate system. Threats to agriculture, forestry and other 
ecosystems, but also the role of land and forest management in climate change, have been documented since the IPCC Second 
Assessment Report, especially so in the Special Report on land use, land-use change and forestry (Watson et al. 2000). The IPCC Special 
Report on extreme events (SREX) discussed sustainable land management, including land-use planning, and ecosystem management 
and restoration among the potential low-regret measures that provide benefits under current climate and a range of future, climate 
change scenarios. Low-regret measures are defined in the report as those with the potential to offer benefits now and lay the 
foundation for tackling future, projected change. Compared to previous IPCC reports, the SRCCL offers a more integrated analysis of 
the land system as it embraces multiple direct and indirect drivers of natural resource management (related to food, water and energy 
securities), which have not previously been addressed to a similar depth (Field et al. 2014a; Edenhofer et al. 2014). 
The recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) targeted specifically the Paris Agreement, without exploring 
the possibility of future global warming trajectories above 2°C (IPCC 2018). Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C 
is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems and to retain more of their services for people. 
In many scenarios proposed in this report, large-scale land use features as a mitigation measure. In the reports of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization (FAO), land degradation is discussed in relation to ecosystem goods and services, principally from a food 
security perspective (FAO and ITPS 2015). The UNCCD report (2014) discusses land degradation through the prism of desertification. 
It devotes due attention to how land management can contribute to reversing the negative impacts of desertification and land 
degradation. The IPBES assessments (2018a, b, c, d, e) focus on biodiversity drivers, including a focus on land degradation and 
desertification, with poverty as a limiting factor. The reports draw attention to a world in peril in which resource scarcity conspires 
with drivers of biophysical and social vulnerability to derail the attainment of sustainable development goals. As discussed in Chapter 
4 of the SRCCL, different definitions of degradation have been applied in the IPBES degradation assessment (IPBES 2018b), which 
potentially can lead to different conclusions for restoration and ecosystem management. 
The SRCCL complements and adds to previous assessments, whilst keeping the IPCC-specific ‘climate perspective’. It includes a focussed 
assessment of risks arising from maladaptation and land-based mitigation (i.e. not only restricted to direct risks from climate change 
impacts) and the co-benefits and trade-offs with sustainable development objectives. As the SRCCL cuts across different policy sectors 
it provides the opportunity to address a number of challenges in an integrative way at the same time, and it progresses beyond other 
IPCC reports in having a much more comprehensive perspective on land.

Chapter  3  examines how the world’s dryland populations are 
uniquely vulnerable to desertification and climate change, but also 
have significant knowledge in adapting to climate variability and 
addressing desertification. Chapter 4 assesses the urgency of tackling 
land degradation across all land ecosystems. Despite accelerating 
trends of land degradation, reversing these trends is attainable 
through restoration efforts and proper implementation of sustainable 
land management (SLM), which is expected to improve resilience to 
climate change, mitigate climate change, and ensure food security 
for generations to come. Food security is the focus of Chapter 5, with 
an assessment of the risks and opportunities that climate change 
presents to food systems, considering how mitigation and adaptation 
can contribute to both human and planetary health.
Chapter 6 focuses on the response options within the land system 
that deal with trade-offs and increase benefits in an integrated way 
in support of the SDGs. Chapter 7 highlights these aspects further, by 
assessing the opportunities, decision-making and policy responses to 
risks in the climate-land-human system.
1.1.2 
Status and dynamics of the (global) land system
1.1.2.1 
Land ecosystems and climate change
Land ecosystems play a key role in the climate system, due to their 
large carbon pools and carbon exchange fluxes with the atmosphere 
(Ciais et al. 2013b). Land use, the total of arrangements, activities 
and inputs applied to a parcel of land (such as agriculture, grazing, 
timber extraction, conservation or city dwelling; see Glossary), 
and land management (sum of land-use practices that take place 
within broader land-use categories; see Glossary) considerably 
alter terrestrial ecosystems and play a key role in the global climate 
system. An estimated one-quarter of total anthropogenic GHG 
emissions arise mainly from deforestation, ruminant livestock and 
fertiliser application (Smith et al. 2014; Tubiello et al. 2015; Le Quere 
et al. 2018; Ciais et al. 2013a), and especially methane (CH4) and 
nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agriculture have been rapidly 
increasing over the last decades (Hoesly et al. 2018; Tian et al. 2019) 
(Figure 1.1 and Sections 2.3.2–2.3.3).
Globally, land also serves as a large CO2 sink, which was estimated 
for the period 2008–2017 to be nearly 30% of total anthropogenic 
emissions (Le Quere et al. 2015; Canadell and Schulze 2014; Ciais 
et al.  2013a; Zhu et al.  2016) (Section  2.3.1). This sink has been 
attributed to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, a prolonged 
growing season in cool environments, or forest regrowth (Le Quéré 
et al. 2013; Pugh et al. 2019; Le Quéré et al. 2018; Ciais et al. 2013a; 
Zhu et al. 2016). Whether or not this sink will persist into the future 
is one of the largest uncertainties in carbon cycle and climate 
modelling (Ciais et al. 2013a; Bloom et al. 2016; Friend et al. 2014; 
Le Quere et al. 2018). In addition, changes in vegetation cover caused 
by land use (such as conversion of forest to cropland or grassland, 
and vice versa) can result in regional cooling or warming through 
altered energy and momentum transfer between ecosystems and 
the atmosphere. Regional impacts can be substantial, but whether 
the effect leads to warming or cooling depends on the local context 
(Lee et al.  2011; Zhang et al.  2014; Alkama and Cescatti 2016) 
(Section  2.6). Due to the current magnitude of GHG emissions 
and CO2 carbon dioxide removal in land ecosystems, there is 
high confidence that GHG reduction measures in agriculture, 
livestock management and forestry would have substantial climate 
change mitigation potential, with co-benefits for biodiversity and 
ecosystem services (Smith and  Gregory 2013; Smith et al.  2014; 
Griscom et al. 2017) (Sections 2.6 and 6.3).
The mean temperature over land for the period 2006–2015 
was 1.53°C higher than for the period 1850–1900, and 0.66°C larger 
than the equivalent global mean temperature change (Section 2.2). 
Climate change affects land ecosystems in various ways (Section 7.2). 
Growing seasons and natural biome boundaries shift in response to 
warming or changes in precipitation (Gonzalez et al. 2010; Wärlind 
et al.  2014; Davies-Barnard et al.  2015; Nakamura et al.  2017). 
Atmospheric CO2 increases have been attributed to underlie, at 
least partially, observed woody plant cover increase in grasslands 
and savannahs (Donohue et al. 2013). Climate change-induced shifts 
in habitats, together with warmer temperatures, cause pressure on 
plants and animals (Pimm et al. 2014; Urban et al. 2016). National 
cereal crop losses of nearly 10% have been estimated for the period 
1964–2007 as a consequence of heat and drought weather extremes 
(Deryng et al. 2014; Lesk et al. 2016). Climate change is expected 
to reduce yields in areas that are already under heat and water 
stress (Schlenker and Lobell 2010; Lobell et al. 2011, 2012; Challinor 
85

et al. 2014) (Section 5.2.2). At the same time, warmer temperatures 
can increase productivity in cooler regions (Moore and Lobell 2015) 
and might open opportunities for crop area expansion, but any 
overall benefits might be counterbalanced by reduced suitability in 
warmer regions (Pugh et al. 2016; Di Paola et al. 2018). Increasing 
atmospheric CO2 is expected to increase productivity and water 
use efficiency in crops and in forests (Muller et al. 2015; Nakamura 
et al. 2017; Kimball 2016). The increasing number of extreme weather 
events linked to climate change is also expected to result in forest 
losses; heat waves and droughts foster wildfires (Seidl et al. 2017; 
Fasullo et al.  2018) (Cross-Chapter Box  3 in Chapter  2). Episodes 
of observed enhanced tree mortality across many world regions 
have been attributed to heat and drought stress (Allen et al. 2010; 
Anderegg et al. 2012), whilst weather extremes also impact local 
infrastructure and hence transportation and trade in land-related 
goods (Schweikert et al. 2014; Chappin and van der Lei 2014). Thus, 
adaptation is a  key challenge to reduce adverse impacts on land 
systems (Section 1.3.6).
1.1.2.2 
Current patterns of land use and land cover
Around three-quarters of the global ice-free land, and most of the 
highly productive land area, are by now under some form of land use 
(Erb et al. 2016a; Luyssaert et al. 2014; Venter et al. 2016) (Table 1.1). 
One-third of used land is associated with changed land cover. 
Grazing land is the single largest land-use category, followed by used 
forestland and cropland. The total land area used to raise livestock 
is notable: it includes all grazing land and an estimated additional

one-fifth of cropland for feed production (Foley et al. 2011). Globally, 
60–85% of the total forested area is used, at different levels of 
intensity, but information on management practices globally is scarce 
(Erb et al. 2016a). Large areas of unused (primary) forests remain only 
in the tropics and northern boreal zones (Luyssaert et al. 2014; Birdsey 
and Pan 2015; Morales-Hidalgo et al. 2015; Potapov et al. 2017; Erb 
et al. 2017), while 73–89% of other, non-forested natural ecosystems 
(natural grasslands, savannahs, etc.) are used. Large uncertainties 
relate to the extent of forest (32.0–42.5 million km2) and grazing 
land (39–62  million km2), due to discrepancies in definitions and 
observation methods (Luyssaert et al. 2014; Erb et al. 2017; Putz and 
Redford 2010; Schepaschenko et al.  2015; Birdsey and Pan 2015; 
FAO 2015a; Chazdon et al. 2016a; FAO 2018a). Infrastructure areas 
(including settlements, transportation and mining), while being 
almost negligible in terms of extent, represent particularly pervasive 
land-use activities, with far-reaching ecological, social and economic 
implications (Cherlet et al. 2018; Laurance et al. 2014).
The large imprint of humans on the land surface has led to the 
definition of anthromes, i.e. large-scale ecological patterns created 
by the sustained interactions between social and ecological drivers. 
The dynamics of these ‘anthropogenic biomes’ are key for land-use 
impacts as well as for the design of integrated response options 
(Ellis and Ramankutty 2008; Ellis et al. 2010; Cherlet et al. 2018; Ellis 
et al. 2010) (Chapter 6).
The intensity of land use varies hugely within and among different 
land-use types and regions. Averaged globally, around 10% of the 
ice-free land surface was estimated to be intensively managed (such 
as tree plantations, high livestock density grazing, large agricultural 
inputs), two-thirds moderately and the remainder at low intensities 
(Erb et al.  2016a). Practically all cropland is fertilised, with large 
regional variations. Irrigation is responsible for 70% of ground- or 
surface-water withdrawals by humans (Wisser et al. 2008; Chaturvedi 
et al. 2015; Siebert et al. 2015; FAOSTAT 2018). Humans appropriate 
one-quarter to one-third of the total potential net primary production 
(NPP),  i.e.  the NPP that would prevail in the absence of land use 
(estimated at about 60 GtC yr–1; Bajželj et al. 2014; Haberl et al. 2014), 
about equally through biomass harvest and changes in NPP due to land 
management. The current total of agricultural (cropland and grazing) 
biomass harvest is estimated at about 6 GtC yr–1, around 50–60% of 
this is consumed by livestock. Forestry harvest for timber and wood 
fuel amounts to about 1 GtC yr–1 (Alexander et al. 2017; Bodirsky and 
Müller 2014; Lassaletta et al. 2014, 2016; Mottet et al. 2017; Haberl 
et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2014; Bais et al. 2015; Bajželj et al. 2014) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6).
1.1.2.3 
Past and ongoing trends
Globally, cropland area changed by +15% and the area of permanent 
pastures by +8% since the early 1960s (FAOSTAT 2018), with strong 
regional differences (Figure  1.3). In contrast, cropland production 
since 1961 increased by about 3.5 times, the production of animal 
products by  2.5 times, and forestry by  1.5 times; in parallel with 
strong yield (production per unit area) increases (FAOSTAT 2018) 
(Figure 1.3). Per capita calorie supply increased by 17% since 1970 
(Kastner et al.  2012), and diet composition changed markedly, 
tightly associated with economic development and lifestyle: since 
the early 1960s, per capita dairy product consumption increased 
by a factor of 1.2, and meat and vegetable oil consumption more 
than doubled (FAO 2017, 2018b; Tilman and Clark 2014; Marques 
et al.  2019). Population and livestock production represent key 
drivers of the global expansion of cropland for food production, only 
partly compensated by yield increases at the global level (Alexander 
et al. 2015). A number of studies have reported reduced growth rates 
or stagnation in yields in some regions in the last decades (medium 
evidence, high agreement; Lin and Huybers 2012; Ray et al. 2012; 
Elbehri, Aziz, Joshua Elliott 2015) (Section 5.2.2).
The past increases in agricultural production have been associated 
with strong increases in agricultural inputs (Foley et al. 2011; Siebert 
et al. 2015; Lassaletta et al. 2016) (Figures 1.1 and 1.3). Irrigation area 
doubled, total nitrogen fertiliser use increased by 800% (FAOSTAT 
2018; IFASTAT 2018) since the early 1960s. Biomass trade volumes 
grew by a factor of nine (in tonnes dry matter yr–1) in this period, 
which is much stronger than production (FAOSTAT 2018), resulting 
in a  growing spatial disconnect between regions of production 
and consumption (Friis et al. 2016; Friis and Nielsen 2017; Schröter 
et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2013; Krausmann and Langthaler 2019). Urban 
and other infrastructure areas expanded by a factor of two since 1960 
(Krausmann et al. 2013), resulting in disproportionally large losses 
of highly fertile cropland (Seto and Reenberg 2014; Martellozzo 
et al. 2015; Bren d’Amour et al. 2016; Seto and Ramankutty 2016; 
van Vliet et al. 2017). World regions show distinct patterns of change 
(Figure 1.3).
While most pastureland expansion replaced natural grasslands, 
cropland expansion replaced mainly forests (Ramankutty et al. 2018; 
Ordway et al.  2017; Richards and Friess 2016). Noteworthy large 
conversions occurred in tropical dry woodlands and savannahs, for 
example, in the Brazilian Cerrado (Lehmann and Parr 2016; Strassburg 
et al.  2017), the South American Caatinga and Chaco regions 
(Parr  et al.  2014; Lehmann and Parr 2016) or African savannahs 
(Ryan et al. 2016). More than half of the original 4.3–12.6 million km2 
global wetlands (Erb et al. 2016a; Davidson 2014; Dixon et al. 2016) 
have been drained; since 1970 the wetland extent index, developed 
by aggregating data field-site time series that report changes in local 
inland wetland area, indicates a decline of more than 30% (Darrah 
et al. 2019) (Figure 1.1 and Section 4.2.1). Likewise, one-third of the 
estimated global area that in a non-used state would be covered in 
forests (Erb et al. 2017) has been converted to agriculture.
Global forest area declined by 3% since 1990 (about –5% since 1960) 
and continues to do so (FAO 2015a; Keenan et al. 2015; MacDicken 
et al. 2015; FAO 1963; Figure 1.1), but uncertainties are large. Low 
agreement relates to the concomitant trend of global tree cover. 
Some remote-sensing based assessments show global net-losses 
of forest or tree cover (Li et al. 2016; Nowosad et al. 2018; Hansen 
et al. 2013); others indicate a net gain (Song et al. 2018). Tree-cover 
gains would be in line with observed and modelled increases in 
photosynthetic active tissues  (‘greening’;  Chen et al.  2019; Zhu 
et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2018; de Jong et al. 2013; Pugh et al. 2019; De 
Kauwe et al. 2016; Kolby Smith et al. 2015) (Box 2.3 in Chapter 2), but 
confidence remains low whether gross forest or tree-cover gains are

B. Selected land-use pressures and impacts. The map shows the ratio between impacts on biomass stocks of land-cover conversions and of land management (changes that occur 
with land-cover types; only changes larger than 30 gC m–2 displayed; Erb et al. 2017), compared to the biomass stocks of the potential vegetation (vegetation that would prevail 
in the absence of land use, but with current climate). The inlay figures show, from left to right (e) the global Human Appropriation of Net Primary production (HANPP) in the year 
2005, in gC m–2 yr–1 (Krausmann et al. 2013).  The sum of the three components represents the NPP of the potential vegetation and consist of: (i) NPPeco, i.e. the amount of NPP 
remaining in ecosystem after harvest, (ii) HANPPharv, i.e. NPP harvested or killed during harvest, and (iii) HANPPluc, i.e. NPP foregone due to land-use change. The sum of NPPeco 
and HANPPharv is the NPP of the actual vegetation (Haberl et al. 2014; Krausmann et al. 2013). The two central inlay figures show changes in land-use intensity, standardised 
to 2014, related to (f) cropland (yields, fertilisation, irrigated area) and (g) forestry harvest per forest area, and grazers and monogastric livestock density per agricultural area 
(FAOSTAT 2018). (h) Cumulative CO2 fluxes between land and the atmosphere between 2000 and 2014. LUC: annual CO2 land use flux due to changes in land cover and forest

rising CO2 and N concentrations), excluding impacts of land-use change (Le Quéré et al. 2018) (Section 2.3).

as large, or larger, than losses. This uncertainty, together with poor 
information on forest management, affects estimates and attribution 
of the land carbon sink (Sections 2.3, 4.3 and 4.6). Discrepancies are 
caused by different classification schemes and applied thresholds 
(e.g., minimum tree height and tree-cover thresholds used to define 
a forest), the divergence of forest and tree cover, and differences 
in methods and spatiotemporal resolution (Keenan et al.  2015; 
Schepaschenko et al. 2015; Bastin et al. 2017; Sloan and Sayer 2015; 
Chazdon et al. 2016a; Achard et al. 2014). However, there is robust 
evidence  and high agreement that a  net loss of forest and tree 
cover prevails in the tropics and a net gain, mainly of secondary, 
semi-natural and planted forests, in the temperate and boreal zones.
The observed regional and global historical land-use trends result 
in regionally distinct patterns of C  fluxes between land and the 
atmosphere (Figure 1.3B). They are also associated with declines in 
biodiversity, far above background rates (Ceballos et al. 2015; De 
Vos et al. 2015; Pimm et al. 2014; Newbold et al. 2015; Maxwell 
et al. 2016; Marques et al. 2019). Biodiversity losses from past global 
land-use change have been estimated to be about 8–14%, depending 
on the biodiversity indicator applied (Newbold et al. 2015; Wilting 
et al. 2017; Gossner et al. 2016; Newbold et al. 2018; Paillet et al. 2010). 
In future, climate warming has been projected to accelerate losses 
of species diversity rapidly (Settele et al. 2014; Urban et al. 2016; 
Scholes et al. 2018; Fischer et al. 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). 
The concomitance of land-use and climate change pressures render 
ecosystem restoration a key challenge (Anderson-Teixeira 2018; Yang 
et al. 2019) (Sections 4.8 and 4.9).

Future trends in the global land system
Human population is projected to increase to nearly 9.8 (± 1) billion 
people by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100 (United Nations 2018). More 
people, a growing global middle class (Crist et al. 2017), economic 
growth, and continued urbanisation (Jiang and O’Neill 2017) increase 
the pressures on expanding crop and pasture area and intensifying 
land management. Changes in diets, efficiency and technology 
could reduce these pressures (Billen et al.  2015; Popp et al.  2016; 
Muller et al. 2017; Alexander et al. 2015; Springmann et al. 2018; Myers 
et al. 2017; Erb et al. 2016c; FAO 2018b) (Sections 5.3 and 6.2.2).
Given the large uncertainties underlying the many drivers of land 
use, as well as their complex relation to climate change and other 
biophysical constraints, future trends in the global land system 
are explored in scenarios and models that seek to span across 
these uncertainties (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). Generally, 
these scenarios indicate a  continued increase in global food 
demand, owing to population growth and increasing wealth. The 
associated land area needs are a key uncertainty, a function of the 
interplay between production, consumption, yields, and production 
efficiency (in particular for livestock and waste) (FAO 2018b; 
van Vuuren et al. 2017; Springmann et al. 2018; Riahi et al. 2017; 
Prestele et al. 2016; Ramankutty et al. 2018; Erb et al. 2016b; Popp 
et al. 2016) (Section 1.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). Many 
factors, such as climate change, local contexts, education, human and 
social capital, policy-making, economic framework conditions, energy 
availability, degradation, and many more, affect this interplay, as 
discussed in all chapters of this report.
Global telecouplings in the land system, the distal connections 
and multidirectional flows between regions and land systems, are 
expected to increase, due to urbanisation (Seto et al. 2012; van Vliet 
et al. 2017; Jiang and O’Neill 2017; Friis et al. 2016), and international 
trade (Konar et al. 2016; Erb et al. 2016b; Billen et al. 2015; Lassaletta 
et al. 2016). Telecoupling can support efficiency gains in production, 
but can also lead to complex cause–effect chains and indirect 
effects such as land competition or leakage (displacement of the 
environmental impacts; see Glossary), with governance challenges 
(Baldos and Hertel 2015; Kastner et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2013; Wood 
et al. 2018; Schröter et al. 2018; Lapola et al. 2010; Jadin et al. 2016; 
Erb et al. 2016b; Billen et al. 2015; Chaudhary and Kastner 2016; 
Marques et al. 2019; Seto and Ramankutty 2016) (Section 1.2.1.5). 
Furthermore, urban growth is anticipated to occur at the expense 
of fertile (crop)land, posing a food security challenge, in particular 
in regions of high population density and agrarian-dominated 
economies, with limited capacity to compensate for these losses (Seto 
et al. 2012; Güneralp et al. 2013; Aronson et al. 2014; Martellozzo 
et al. 2015; Bren d’Amour et al. 2016; Seto and Ramankutty 2016; 
van Vliet et al. 2017).
Future climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration 
are expected to accentuate existing challenges by, for example, 
shifting biomes or affecting crop yields (Baldos and Hertel 
2015; Schlenker and Lobell 2010; Lipper et al.  2014; Challinor 
et al. 2014; Myers et al. 2017) (Section 5.2.2), as well as through 
land-based climate change mitigation. There is high confidence that 
large-scale implementation of bioenergy or afforestation can further 
exacerbate existing challenges (Smith et al. 2016) (Section 1.3.1 and 
Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6).
1.2.1.2 
Land degradation
As discussed in Chapter 4, the concept of land degradation, including 
its definition, has been used in different ways in different communities 
and in previous assessments (such as the IPBES Land Degradation 
and Restoration Assessment). In the SRCCL, land degradation is 
defined as a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or 
indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate 
change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of 
the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or value 
to humans. This definition applies to forest and non-forest land 
(Chapter 4 and Glossary).
Land degradation is a  critical issue for ecosystems around the 
world due to the loss of actual or potential productivity or utility 
(Ravi et al.  2010; Mirzabaev et al.  2015; FAO and ITPS 2015; 
Cerretelli et al.  2018). Land degradation is driven to a  large 
89
Framing and context

degree by unsustainable agriculture and forestry, socio-economic 
pressures, such as rapid urbanisation and population growth, and 
unsustainable production practices in combination with climatic 
factors (Field et al. 2014b; Lal 2009; Beinroth et al. 1994; Abu Hammad 
and Tumeizi 2012; Ferreira et al. 2018; Franco and Giannini 2005; 
Abahussain et al. 2002).
Global estimates of the total degraded area vary from less than 
10  million km2 to over 60  million km2, with additionally large 
disagreement regarding the spatial distribution (Gibbs and Salmon 
2015) (Section 4.3). The annual increase in the degraded land area 
has been estimated as 50,000–100,000 million km2 yr–1 (Stavi and Lal 
2015), and the loss of total ecosystem services equivalent to about 
10% of the world’s GDP in the year 2010 (Sutton et al. 2016). Although 
land degradation is a common risk across the globe, poor countries 
remain most vulnerable to its impacts. Soil degradation is of particular 
concern, due to the long period necessary to restore soils (Lal 2009; 
Stockmann et al. 2013; Lal 2015), as well as the rapid degradation of 
primary forests through fragmentation (Haddad et al. 2015). Among 
the most vulnerable ecosystems to degradation are high-carbon-
stock wetlands (including peatlands). Drainage of natural wetlands 
for use in agriculture leads to high CO2 emissions and degradation 
(high confidence) (Strack 2008; Limpens et al. 2008; Aich et al. 2014; 
Murdiyarso et al.  2015; Kauffman et al.  2016; Dohong et al.  2017; 
Arifanti et al. 2018; Evans et al. 2019). Land degradation is an important 
factor contributing to uncertainties in the mitigation potential of 
land-based ecosystems (Smith et al. 2014). Furthermore, degradation 
that reduces forest (and agricultural) biomass and soil organic carbon 
leads to higher rates of runoff (high confidence) (Molina et al. 2007; 
Valentin et al. 2008; Mateos et al. 2017; Noordwijk et al. 2017) and 
hence to increasing flood risk (low confidence) (Bradshaw et al. 2007; 
Laurance 2007; van Dijk et al. 2009).
1.2.1.3 
 Desertification
The SRCCL adopts the definition of the UNCCD of desertification, 
being land degradation in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas 
(drylands) (Glossary and Section 3.1.1). Desertification results from 
various factors, including climate variations and human activities, and 
is not limited to irreversible forms of land degradation (Tal 2010; Bai 
et al. 2008). A critical challenge in the assessment of desertification 
is to identify a  ‘non-desertified’ reference state (Bestelmeyer 
et al.  2015). While climatic trends and variability can change the 
intensity of desertification processes, some authors exclude climate 
effects, arguing that desertification is a  purely human-induced 
process of land degradation with different levels of severity and 
consequences (Sivakumar 2007).
As a consequence of varying definitions and different methodologies, 
the area of desertification varies widely (D’Odorico et al.  2013; 
Bestelmeyer et al. 2015; and references therein). Arid regions of the 
world cover up to about 46% of the total terrestrial surface (about 
60 million km2) (Pravalie 2016; Koutroulis 2019). Around 3 billion 
people reside in dryland regions (D’Odorico et al.  2013; Maestre 
et al. 2016) (Section 3.1.1). In 2015, about 500 (360–620) million 
people lived within areas which experienced desertification between 
1980s and 2000s (Figure 1.1and Section 3.1.1). The combination of 
low rainfall with frequently infertile soils renders these regions, and 
the people who rely on them, vulnerable to both climate change, and 
unsustainable land management (high confidence). In spite of the 
national, regional and international efforts to combat desertification, 
it remains one of the major environmental problems (Abahussain 
et al. 2002; Cherlet et al. 2018).
1.2.1.4 
Food security, food systems and linkages 
to land-based ecosystems
The High Level Panel of Experts of the Committee on Food Security 
define the food system as to “gather all the elements (environment, 
people, inputs, processes, infrastructures, institutions, etc.) and 
activities that relate to the production, processing, distribution, 
preparation and consumption of food, and the output of these 
activities, including socio-economic and environmental outcomes” 
(HLPE 2017). Likewise, food security has been defined as “a situation 
that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and 
economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets 
their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy 
life” (FAO 2017). By this definition, food security is characterised 
by food availability, economic and physical access to food, food 
utilisation and food stability over time. Food and nutrition security is 
one of the key outcomes of the food system (FAO 2018b; Figure 1.4).
After a prolonged decline, world hunger appears to be on the rise 
again, with the number of undernourished people having increased 
to an estimated 821 million in 2017, up from 804 million in 2016 
and 784  million in 2015, although still below the 900  million 
reported in 2000 (FAO et al.  2018) (Section  5.1.2). Of the total 
undernourished in 2018, for example, 256.5 million lived in Africa, 
and 515.1 million in Asia (excluding Japan). The same FAO report also 
states that child undernourishment continues to decline, but levels of 
overweight populations and obesity are increasing. The total number 
of overweight children in 2017 was 38–40 million worldwide, and 
globally up to around two billion adults are by now overweight 
(Section 5.1.2). FAO also estimated that close to 2000 million people 
suffer from micronutrient malnutrition (FAO 2018b).
Food insecurity most notably occurs in situations of conflict, and 
conflict combined with droughts or floods (Cafiero et al. 2018; Smith 
et al. 2017). The close parallel between food insecurity prevalence 
and poverty means that tackling development priorities would 
enhance sustainable land use options for climate mitigation.
Climate change affects the food system as changes in trends and 
variability in rainfall and temperature variability impact crop and 
livestock productivity and total production (Osborne and Wheeler 
2013; Tigchelaar et al.  2018; Iizumi and Ramankutty 2015), the 
nutritional quality of food (Loladze 2014; Myers et al. 2014; Ziska 
et al. 2016; Medek et al. 2017), water supply (Nkhonjera 2017), and 
incidence of pests and diseases (Curtis et al. 2018). These factors also 
impact on human health, increasing morbidity and affecting human 
ability to process ingested food (Franchini and Mannucci 2015; Wu 
et al. 2016; Raiten and Aimone 2017). At the same time, the food 
system generates negative externalities (the environmental effects 
of production and consumption) in the form of GHG emissions

water quality (Malone et al. 2014; Norse and Ju 2015), and e cosystem 
services loss (Schipper et al. 2014; Eeraerts et al. 2017) with direct 
and indirect impacts on climate change and reduced resilience to 
climate variability. As food systems are assessed in relation to 
their contribution to global warming and/or to land degradation 
(e.g., livestock systems) it is critical to evaluate their contribution to 
food security and livelihoods and to consider alternatives, especially 
for developing countries where food insecurity is prevalent (Röös 
et al. 2017; Salmon et al. 2018).
1.2.1.5 
 Challenges arising from land governance
 Land-use change has both positive and negative effects: it can lead 
to economic growth, but it can become a  source of tension and 
social unrest leading to elite capture, and competition (Haberl 2015). 
Competition for land plays out continuously among different use 
types (cropland, pastureland, forests, urban spaces, and conservation 
and protected lands) and between different users within the same 
land-use category (subsistence vs commercial farmers) (Dell’Angelo 
et al. 2017b). Competition is mediated through economic and market 
forces (expressed through land rental and purchases, as well as trade 
and investments). In the context of such transactions, power relations 
often disfavour disadvantaged groups such as small-scale farmers, 
indigenous communities or women (Doss et al.  2015; Ravnborg 
et al. 2016). These drivers are infl uenced to a large degree by policies, 
institutions and governance structures. Land governance determines 
not only who can access the land, but also the role of land ownership 
(legal, formal, customary or collective) which infl uences land use, 
land-use change and the resulting land competition (Moroni 2018).
Globally, there is competition for land because it is a fi nite resource 
and because most of the highly productive land is already exploited 
by humans (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011; Lambin 2012; Venter 
et al. 2016). Driven by growing population, urbanisation, demand for 
food and energy, as well as land degradation, competition for land is 
expected to accentuate land scarcity in the future (Tilman et al. 2011; 
Foley et al. 2011; Lambin 2012; Popp et al. 2016) (robust evidence, 
high agreement). Climate change infl uences land use both directly and 
indirectly, as climate policies can also a play a role in increasing land 
competition via forest conservation policies, afforestation, or energy

F igure 1.4 |  Food system (and its relations to land and climate): The food system is conceptualised through supply (production, processing, marketing and retailing) 
and demand (consumption and diets) that are shaped by physical, economic, social and cultural determinants infl uencing choices, access, utilisation, quality, safety and waste. 
Food system drivers (ecosystem services, economics and technology, social and cultural norms and traditions, and demographics) combine with the enabling conditions (policies, 
institutions and governance) to affect food system outcomes including food security, nutrition and health, livelihoods, economic and cultural benefi ts as well as environmental 
outcomes or side-effects (nutrient and soil loss, water use and quality, GHG emissions and other pollutants). Climate and climate change have direct impacts on the food system 
(productivity, variability, nutritional quality) while the latter contributes to local climate (albedo, evapotranspiration) and global warming (GHGs). The land system (function, 
structures, and processes) affects the food system directly (food production) and indirectly (ecosystem services) while food demand and supply processes affect land (land-use 
change) and land-related processes (e.g., land degradation, desertifi cation) (Chapter 5).

crop production (Section 1.3.1), with the potential for implications for 
food security (Hussein et al. 2013) and local land-ownership.
An example of large-scale change in land ownership is the much-debated 
large-scale land acquisition (LSLA) by investors which peaked in 2008 
during the food price crisis, the financial crisis, and has also been 
linked to the search for biofuel investments (Dell’Angelo et al. 2017a). 
Since 2000, almost 50 million hectares of land have been acquired, 
and there are no signs of stagnation in the foreseeable future (Land 
Matrix 2018). The LSLA phenomenon, which largely targets agriculture, 
is widespread, including Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern 
Europe and Latin America (Rulli et al. 2012; Nolte et al. 2016; Constantin 
et al. 2017). LSLAs are promoted by investors and host governments on 
economic grounds (infrastructure, employment, market development) 
(Deininger et al. 2011), but their social and environmental impacts can 
be negative and significant (Dell’Angelo et al. 2017a).
Much of the criticism of LSLA focuses on its social impacts, 
especially the threat to local communities’ land rights (especially 
indigenous people and women) (Anseeuw et al. 2011) and displaced 
communities creating secondary land expansion (Messerli et al. 2014; 
Davis et al. 2015). The promises that LSLAs would develop efficient 
agriculture on non-forested, unused land (Deininger et al. 2011) has 
so far not been fulfilled. However, LSLA is not the only outcome of 
weak land governance structures (Wang et al. 2016): other forms of 
inequitable or irregular land acquisition can also be home-grown, 
pitting one community against a more vulnerable group (Xu 2018) 
or land capture by urban elites (McDonnell 2017). As demands on 
land are increasing, building governance capacity and securing land 
tenure becomes essential to attain sustainable land use, which has 
the potential to mitigate climate change, promote food security, and 
potentially reduce risks of climate-induced migration and associated 
risks of conflicts (Section 7.6).
1.2.2 
Progress in dealing with uncertainties in 
assessing land processes in the climate system
1.2.2.1 
Concepts related to risk, uncertainty and confidence
In context of the SRCCL, risk refers to the potential for the adverse 
consequences for human or (land-based) ecological systems, arising 
from climate change or responses to climate change. Risk related to 
climate change impacts integrates across the hazard itself, the time 
of exposure and the vulnerability of the system; the assessment of 
all three of these components, their interactions and outcomes, is 
uncertain (see Glossary for expanded definition, and Section 7.1.2). 
For instance, a risk to human society is the continued loss of productive 
land which might arise from climate change, mismanagement, or 
a  combination of both factors. However, risk can also arise from 
the potential for adverse consequences from responses to climate 
change, such as widespread deployment of bioenergy which is 
intended to reduce GHG emissions and thus limit climate change, but 
can present its own risks to food security (Chapters 5–7).
Demonstrating with some statistical certainty that the climate or the 
land system affected by climate or land use has changed (detection), 
and evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors 
to that change (with a formal assessment of confidence (attribution); 
see Glossary) remain challenging aspects in both observations and 
models (Rosenzweig and Neofotis 2013; Gillett et al.  2016; Lean 
2018). Uncertainties arising for example, from missing or imprecise 
data, ambiguous terminology, incomplete process representation in 
models, or human decision-making contribute to these challenges, 
and some examples are provided in this subsection. In order to 
reflect various sources of uncertainties in the state of scientific 
understanding, IPCC assessment reports provide estimates of 
confidence (Mastrandrea et al. 2011). This confidence language is 
also used in the SRCCL (Figure 1.5).
1.2.2.2 
Nature and scope of uncertainties related to land use
Identification and communication of uncertainties is crucial to support 
decision making towards sustainable land management. Providing 
a  robust, and comprehensive understanding of uncertainties in 
observations, models and scenarios is a fundamental first step in the 
IPCC confidence framework (see above). This will remain a challenge in 
future, but some important progress has been made over recent years.
Uncertainties in observations
The detection of changes in vegetation cover and structural properties 
underpins the assessment of land-use change, degradation and 
desertification. It is continuously improving by enhanced Earth 
observation capacity (Hansen et al.  2013; He et al.  2018; Ardö 
et al.  2018; Spennemann et al.  2018) (see also Table SM.1.1 in 
Supplementary Material). Likewise, the picture of how soil organic 
carbon, and GHG and water fluxes, respond to land-use change 
and land management continues to improve through advances in 
methodologies and sensors (Kostyanovsky et al.  2018; Brümmer 
et al. 2017; Iwata et al. 2017; Valayamkunnath et al. 2018). In both 
cases, the relative shortness of the record, data gaps, data treatment 
algorithms and – for remote sensing – differences in the definitions of 
major vegetation-cover classes limit the detection of trends (Alexander 
et al. 2016a; Chen et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2014; Lacaze et al. 2015; Song 
2018; Peterson et al. 2017). In many developing countries, the cost of 
satellite remote sensing remains a challenge, although technological 
advances are starting to overcome this problem (Santilli et al. 2018), 
while ground-based observations networks are often not available.
Integration of multiple data sources in model and data assimilation 
schemes reduces uncertainties (Li et al. 2017; Clark et al. 2017; Lees 
et al.  2018), which might be important for the advancement of 
early warning systems. Early warning systems are a key feature of 
short-term (i.e. seasonal) decision-support systems and are becoming 
increasingly important for sustainable land management and food 
security (Shtienberg 2013; Jarroudi et al.  2015) (Sections  6.2.3 
and 7.4.3). Early warning systems can help to optimise fertiliser and 
water use, aid disease suppression, and/or increase the economic 
benefit by enabling strategic farming decisions on when and what 
to plant (Caffi et al. 2012; Watmuff et al. 2013; Jarroudi et al. 2015; 
Chipanshi et al. 2015). Their suitability depends on the capability of 
the methods to accurately predict crop or pest developments, which 
in turn depends on expert agricultural knowledge, and the accuracy of 
92

the weather data used to run phenological models (Caffi et al. 2012; 
Shtienberg 2013).
Uncertainties in models
Model intercomparison is a  widely used approach to quantify 
some sources of uncertainty in climate change, land-use change 
and ecosystem modelling, often associated with the calculation of 
model-ensemble medians or means (see e.g., Sections 2.2 and 5.2). 
Even models of broadly similar structure differ in their projected 
outcome for the same input, as seen for instance in the spread in 
climate change projections from Earth System Models (ESMs) to 
similar future anthropogenic GHG emissions (Parker 2013; Stocker 
et al. 2013a). These uncertainties arise, for instance, from different 
parameter values, different processes represented in models, or how 
these processes are mathematically described. If the outputs of ESM 
simulations are used as input to impact models, these uncertainties 
can propagate to projected impacts (Ahlstrom et al. 2013).
Thus, the increased quantification of model performance in 
benchmarking exercises (the repeated confrontation of models with 
observations to establish a track-record of model developments and 
performance) is an important development to support the design 
and the interpretation of the outcomes of model ensemble studies 
(Randerson et al.  2009; Luo et al.  2012; Kelley et al.  2013). Since 
observational datasets in themselves are uncertain, benchmarking 
benefits from transparent information on the observations that are 
used, and the inclusion of multiple, regularly updated data sources (Luo 
et al. 2012; Kelley et al. 2013). Improved benchmarking approaches 
and the associated scoring of models may support weighted model 
means contingent on model performance. This could be an important 
step forward when calculating ensemble means across a  range of 
models (Buisson et al. 2009; Parker 2013; Prestele et al. 2016).
Uncertainties arising from unknown futures
Large differences exist in projections of future land-cover change, 
both between and within scenario projections (Fuchs et al.  2015; 
Eitelberg et al. 2016; Popp et al. 2016; Krause et al. 2017; Alexander 
et al. 2016a). These differences reflect the uncertainties associated 
with baseline data, thematic classifications, different model structures 
and model parameter estimation (Alexander et al. 2017a; Prestele 
et al. 2016; Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). Likewise, projections 
of future land-use change are also highly uncertain, reflecting  – 
among other factors – the absence of important crop, pasture and 
management processes in Integrated Assessment Models (Rose 
2014) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1 ) and in models of the 
terrestrial carbon cycle (Arneth et al. 2017). These processes have 
been shown to have large impacts on carbon stock changes (Arneth 
et al.  2017). Common scenario frameworks are used to capture 
the range of future uncertainties in scenarios. The most commonly 
used recent framework in climate change studies is based on the 
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and the Shared 
Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (Popp et al. 2016; Riahi et al. 2017). 
The RCPs prescribe levels of radiative forcing (W m–2) arising from 
different atmospheric concentrations of GHGs that lead to different 
levels of climate change. For example, RCP2.6 (2.6 W m–2) is projected 
to lead to global mean temperature changes of about 0.9°C–2.3°C, 
and RCP8.5 (8.5 W  m–2) to global mean temperature changes of 
about 3.2°C–5.4°C (van Vuuren et al. 2014).
The SSPs describe alternative trajectories of future socio-economic 
development with a  focus on challenges to climate mitigation 
and challenges to climate adaptation (O’Neill et al.  2014). SSP1 
represents a sustainable and cooperative society with a low-carbon 
economy and high capacity to adapt to climate change. SSP3 has 
social inequality that entrenches reliance on fossil fuels and limits

Cross-Chapter Box 1 |  Scenarios and other methods to characterise the future of land
1 
Different communities have a different understanding of the concept of pathways (IPCC 2018). Here, we refer to pathways as a description of the time-dependent actions 
required to move from today’s world to a set of future visions (IPCC 2018). However, the term pathways is commonly used in the climate change literature as a synonym 
for projections or trajectories (e.g., shared socio-economic pathways).

About this box
The land-climate system is complex and future changes are uncertain, but methods exist (collectively known as futures analysis) 
to help decision-makers in navigating through this uncertainty. Futures analysis comprises a number of different and widely 
used methods, such as scenario analysis (Rounsevell and Metzger 2010), envisioning or target setting (Kok  et al.  2018), 
pathways analysis (IPBES 2016; IPCC 2018),1 and conditional probabilistic futures (Vuuren et al. 2018; Engstrom et al. 2016; 
Henry et al. 2018) (Table 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). Scenarios and other methods to characterise the future can support a discourse 
with decision-makers about the sustainable development options that are available to them. All chapters of this assessment draw 
conclusions from futures analysis and so, the purpose of this box is to outline the principal methods used, their application domains, 
their uncertainties and their limitations.
Exploratory scenario analysis
Many exploratory scenarios are reported in climate and land system studies on climate change (Dokken 2014), such as related to 
land-based, climate change mitigation via reforestation/afforestation, avoided deforestation or bioenergy (Kraxner et al.  2013; 
Humpenoder et al. 2014; Krause et al. 2017) and climate change impacts and adaptation (Warszawski et al. 2014). There are global-scale 
scenarios of food security (Foley et al. 2011; Pradhan et al. 2013, 2014), but fewer scenarios of desertification, land degradation and 
restoration (Wolff et al. 2018). Exploratory scenarios combine qualitative ‘storylines’ or descriptive narratives of the underlying causes 
(or drivers) of change (Nakicenovic and Swart 2000; Rounsevell and Metzger 2010; O’Neill et al. 2014) with quantitative projections 
from computer models. Different types of models are used for this purpose based on very different modelling paradigms, baseline 
data and underlying assumptions (Alexander et al. 2016a; Prestele et al. 2016). Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box below outlines how 
a combination of models can quantify these components as well as the interactions between them. 
Exploratory scenarios often show that socio-economic drivers have a larger effect on land-use change than climate drivers 
(Harrison et al. 2014, 2016). Of these, technological development is critical in affecting the production potential (yields) of food 
and bioenergy and the feed conversion efficiency of livestock (Rounsevell et al. 2006; Wise et al. 2014; Kreidenweis et al. 2018), 
as well as the area of land needed for food production (Foley et al. 2011; Weindl et al. 2017; Kreidenweis et al. 2018). Trends in 
consumption, for example, diets or waste reduction, are also fundamental in affecting land-use change (Pradhan et al. 2013; Alexander 
et al. 2016b; Weindl et al. 2017; Alexander et al. 2017; Vuuren et al. 2018; Bajželj et al. 2014). Scenarios of land-based mitigation 
through large-scale bioenergy production and afforestation often lead to negative trade-offs with food security (food prices), water 
resources and biodiversity (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6).
Many exploratory scenarios are based on common frameworks such as the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) (Popp et al. 2016; 
Riahi et al. 2017; Doelman et al. 2018)) (Section 1.2). However, other methods are used. Stylised scenarios prescribe assumptions 
about climate and land-use change solutions, for example, dietary change, food waste reduction and afforestation areas 
adaptive capacity. SSP4 has large differences in income within and 
across world regions; it facilitates low-carbon economies in places, 
but limits adaptive capacity everywhere. SSP5 is a technologically 
advanced world with a strong economy that is heavily dependent on 
fossil fuels, but with high adaptive capacity. SSP2 is an intermediate 
case between SSP1 and SSP3 (O’Neill et al.  2014). The SSPs are 
commonly used with models to project future land-use change 
(Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).
The SSPs map onto the RCPs through shared assumptions. For 
example, a  higher level of climate change (RCP8.5) is associated 
with higher challenges for climate change mitigation (SSP5). Not 
all SSPs are, however, associated with all RCPs. For example, an 
SSP5 world is committed to high fossil fuel use, associated GHG 
emissions, and this is not easily commensurate with lower levels 
of climate change (e.g., RCP2.6). Engstrom et al. (2016) took this 
approach further by ascribing levels of probability that associate 
an SSP with an RCP, contingent on the SSP scenario assumptions 
(Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).

(Pradhan et al. 2013, 2014; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2018b; Seneviratne et al. 2018; Vuuren et al. 2018). These scenarios 
provide useful thought experiments, but the feasibility of achieving the stylised assumptions is often unknown. Shock scenarios 
explore the consequences of low probability, high-impact events such as pandemic diseases, cyber-attacks and failures in food supply 
chains (Challinor et al. 2018), often in food security studies. Because of the diversity of exploratory scenarios, attempts have been 
made to categorise them into ‘archetypes’ based on the similarity between their assumptions in order to facilitate communication 
(IPBES 2018a).
Conditional probabilistic futures explore the consequences of model parameter uncertainty in which these uncertainties are conditional 
on scenario assumptions (Neill 2004). Only a few studies have applied the conditional probabilistic approach to land-use futures 
(Brown et al. 2014; Engstrom et al. 2016; Henry et al. 2018). By accounting for uncertainties in key drivers these studies show large 
ranges in land-use change, for example, global cropland areas of 893–2380 Mha by the end of the 21st century (Engstrom et al. 2016). 
They also find that land-use targets may not be achieved, even across a wide range of scenario parameter settings, because of 
trade-offs arising from the competition for land (Henry et al. 2018; Heck et al. 2018). Accounting for uncertainties across scenario 
assumptions can lead to convergent outcomes for land-use change, which implies that certain outcomes are more robust across 
a wide range of uncertain scenario assumptions (Brown et al. 2014).
In addition to global scale scenario studies, sub-national studies demonstrate that regional climate change impacts on the land system 
are highly variable geographically because of differences in the spatial patterns of both climate and socio-economic change (Harrison 
et al. 2014). Moreover, the capacity to adapt to these impacts is strongly dependent on the regional, socio-economic context and 
coping capacity (Dunford et al. 2014); processes that are difficult to capture in global scale scenarios. Regional scenarios are often 
co-created with stakeholders through participatory approaches (Kok et al. 2014), which are powerful in reflecting diverse worldviews 
and stakeholder values. Stakeholder participatory methods provide additional richness and context to storylines, as well as providing 
salience and legitimacy for local stakeholders (Kok et al. 2014).

Normative scenarios: visions and pathways analysis
Normative scenarios reflect a desired or target-seeking future. Pathways analysis is important in moving beyond the ‘what if?’ 
perspective of exploratory scenarios to evaluate how normative futures might be achieved in practice, recognising that multiple 
pathways may achieve the same future vision. Pathways analysis focuses on consumption and behavioural changes through 
transitions and transformative solutions (IPBES 2018a). Pathways analysis is highly relevant in support of policy, since it outlines 
sets of time-dependent actions and decisions to achieve future targets, especially with respect to sustainable development goals, 
as well as highlighting trade-offs and co-benefits (IPBES 2018a). Multiple, alternative pathways have been shown to exist that 
mitigate trade-offs whilst achieving the priorities for future sustainable development outlined by governments and societal actors. Of 
these alternatives, the most promising focus on long-term societal transformations through education, awareness raising, knowledge 
sharing and participatory decision-making (IPBES 2018a).
What are the limitations of land-use scenarios?
Applying a common scenario framework (e.g., RCPs/SSPs) supports the comparison and integration of climate- and land-system scenarios, 
but a ‘climate-centric’ perspective can limit the capacity of these scenarios to account for a wider range of land-relevant drivers (Rosa 
et al. 2017). For example, in climate mitigation scenarios it is important to assess the impact of mitigation actions on the broader 
environment such as biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, air quality, food security, desertification/degradation and water cycles (Rosa 
et al. 2017). This implies the need for a more encompassing and flexible approach to creating scenarios that considers other environmental 
aspects, not only as a part of impact assessment, but also during the process of creating the scenarios themselves.
A limited number of models can quantify global scale, land-use change scenarios, and there is large variance in the outcomes of these 
models (Alexander et al. 2016a; Prestele et al. 2016). In some cases, there is greater variability between the models themselves than 
between the scenarios that they are quantifying, and these differences vary geographically (Prestele et al. 2016). These differences 
arise from variations in baseline datasets, thematic classes and modelling paradigms (Alexander et al. 2016a; Popp et al. 2016; Prestele 
et al. 2016). Model evaluation is critical in establishing confidence in the outcomes of modelled futures (Ahlstrom et al. 2012; Kelley 
et al. 2013). Some, but not all, land-use models are evaluated against observational data and model evaluation is rarely reported. 
Hence, there is a need for more transparency in land-use modelling, especially in evaluation and testing, as well as making model code 
available with complete sets of scenario outputs (e.g., Dietrich et al. 2018).

1.2.2.3 
Uncertainties in decision-making
Decision-makers develop and implement policy in the face of many 
uncertainties (Rosenzweig and Neofotis 2013; Anav et al. 2013; Ciais 
et al. 2013a; Stocker et al. 2013b) (Section 7.5). In context of climate 
change, the term ‘deep uncertainty’ is frequently used to denote 
situations in which either the analysis of a situation is inconclusive, or 
parties to a decision cannot agree on a number of criteria that would 
help to rank model results in terms of likelihood (e.g., Hallegatte and 
Mach 2016; Maier et al. 2016) (Sections 7.1 and 7.5, and Table SM.1.2 
in Supplementary Material). However, existing uncertainty does not 
support societal and political inaction.
The many ways of dealing with uncertainty in decision-making can 
be summarised by two decision approaches: (economic) cost-benefit 
analysis, and the precautionary approach. A  typical variant of 
cost-benefit analysis is the minimisation of negative consequences. 
This approach needs reliable probability estimates (Gleckler 
et al.  2016; Parker 2013) and tends to focus on the short term. 
The precautionary approach does not take account of probability 
estimates (cf. Raffensperger and Tickner 1999), but instead focuses 
on avoiding the worst outcome (Gardiner 2006).
Between these two extremes, various decision approaches seek to 
address uncertainties in a more reflective manner that avoids the 
limitations of cost-benefit analysis and the precautionary approach. 
Climate-informed decision analysis combines various approaches to 
explore options and the vulnerabilities and sensitivities of certain 
decisions. Such an approach includes stakeholder involvement 
(e.g., elicitation methods), and can be combined with, for example, 
analysis of climate or land-use change modelling (Hallegatte and 
Rentschler 2015; Luedeling and Shepherd 2016).
Flexibility is facilitated by political decisions that are not set in 
stone and can change over time (Walker et al. 2013; Hallegatte and 
Rentschler 2015). Generally, within the research community that 
investigates deep uncertainty, a paradigm is emerging that requires 
the development of a  strategic vision of the long  – or mid-term 
future, while committing to short-term actions and establishing 
a framework to guide future actions, including revisions and flexible 
adjustment of decisions (Haasnoot 2013) (Section 7.5).
1.3 
Response options to the key challenges
A number of response options underpin solutions to the challenges 
arising from GHG emissions from land, and the loss of productivity 
arising from degradation and desertification. These options are 
discussed in Sections 2.5 and 6.2 and rely on (i) land management, 
(ii) value chain management, and (iii) risk management (Table 1.2). 
None of these response options are mutually exclusive, and it is their 
combination in a  regionally, context-specific manner that is most 
likely to achieve co-benefits between climate change mitigation, 
adaptation and other environmental challenges in a cost-effective way 
(Griscom et al. 2017; Kok et al. 2018). Sustainable solutions affecting 
both demand and supply are expected to yield most co-benefits if 
these rely not only on the carbon footprint, but are extended to other 
vital ecosystems such as water, nutrients and biodiversity footprints 
(van Noordwijk and Brussaard 2014; Cremasch 2016). As an entry 
point to the discussion in Chapter 6, we introduce here a selected 
number of examples that cut across climate change mitigation, food 
security, desertification, and degradation issues, including potential 
trade-offs and co-benefits.
Cross-Chapter Box 1 (continued)
There is a small, but growing literature on quantitative pathways to achieve normative visions and their associated trade-offs (IPBES 
2018a). Whilst the visions themselves may be clearly articulated, the societal choices, behaviours and transitions needed to attain 
them, are not. Better accounting for human behaviour and decision-making processes in global scale land-use models would improve 
the capacity to quantify pathways to sustainable futures (Rounsevell et al. 2014; Arneth et al. 2014; Calvin and Bond-Lamberty 2018). 
It is, however, difficult to understand and represent human behaviour and social interaction processes at global scales. Decision-making 
in global models is commonly represented through economic processes (Arneth et al. 2014). Other important human processes for 
land systems including equity, fairness, land tenure and the role of institutions and governance, receive less attention, and this limits 
the use of global models to quantify transformative pathways, adaptation and mitigation (Arneth et al. 2014; Rounsevell et al. 2014; 
Wang et al. 2016). No model exists at present to represent complex human behaviours at the global scale, although the need has 
been highlighted (Rounsevell et al. 2014; Arneth et al. 2014; Robinson et al. 2017; Brown et al. 2017; Calvin and Bond-Lamberty 2018).

1.3.1 
Targeted decarbonisation relying  
on large land-area need
Most global future scenarios that aim to achieve global warming of 
2°C or well below rely on bioenergy (BE; BECCS, with carbon capture 
and storage; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6) or afforestation 
and reforestation (de Coninck et al.  2018; Rogelj et al.  2018b,a; 
Anderson and Peters 2016; Popp et al.  2016; Smith et al.  2016) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). In addition to the very large 
area requirements projected for 2050 or 2100, several other aspects 
of these scenarios have also been criticised. For instance, they 
simulate very rapid technological and societal uptake rates for the 
land-related mitigation measures, when compared with historical 
observations (Turner et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2019; Vaughan and 
Gough 2016). Furthermore, confidence in the projected bioenergy or 
BECCS net carbon uptake potential is low, because of many diverging 
assumptions. This includes assumptions about bioenergy crop yields, 
the possibly large energy demand for CCS, which diminishes the 
net-GHG-saving of bioenergy systems, or the incomplete accounting 
for ecosystem processes and of the cumulative carbon-loss arising 
from natural vegetation clearance for bioenergy crops or bioenergy 
forests and subsequent harvest regimes (Anderson and Peters 
2016; Bentsen 2017; Searchinger et al.  2017; Bayer et al.  2017; 
Fuchs et al. 2017; Pingoud et al. 2018; Schlesinger 2018). Bioenergy 
provision under politically unstable conditions may also be a problem 
(Erb et al. 2012; Searle and Malins 2015).
Large-scale bioenergy plantations and forests may compete for 
the same land area (Harper et al.  2018). Both potentially have 
adverse side effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services, as 
well as socio-economic trade-offs such as higher food prices due 
to land-area competition (Shi et al.  2013; Bárcena et al.  2014; 
Fernandez-Martinez et al.  2014; Searchinger et al.  2015; Bonsch 
et al. 2016; Creutzig et al. 2015; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Santangeli 
et al. 2016; Williamson 2016; Graham et al. 2017; Krause et al. 2017; 
Hasegawa et al.  2018; Humpenoeder et al.  2018). Although 
forest-based mitigation could have co-benefits for biodiversity and 
many ecosystem services, this depends on the type of forest planted 
and the vegetation cover it replaces (Popp et al. 2014; Searchinger 
et al. 2015) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1).
There is high confidence that scenarios with large land requirements 
for climate change mitigation may not achieve SDGs, such as no 
poverty, zero hunger and life on land, if competition for land and the 
need for agricultural intensification are greatly enhanced (Creutzig 
et al.  2016; Dooley and Kartha 2018; Hasegawa et al.  2015; Hof 
et al. 2018; Roy et al. 2018; Santangeli et al. 2016; Boysen et al. 2017; 
Henry et al. 2018; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; UN 2015). This does not 
mean that smaller-scale land-based climate mitigation could not have 
positive outcomes for then achieving these goals (e.g., Sections 6.2, 
and 4.5, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6).

Efforts to increase forest area
While deforestation continues in many world regions, especially in the tropics, large expansion of mostly managed forest area has taken 
place in some countries. In the IPCC context, reforestation (conversion to forest of land that previously contained forests but has been 
converted to some other use) is distinguished from afforestation (conversion to forest of land that historically has not contained 
forests; see Glossary). Past expansion of managed forest area occurred in many world-regions for a variety of reasons, from meeting 
needs for wood fuel or timber (Vadell et al. 2016; Joshi et al. 2011; Zaloumis and Bond 2015; Payn et al. 2015; Shoyama 2008; 
Miyamoto et al. 2011) to restoration-driven efforts, with the aim of enhancing ecological function (Filoso et al. 2017; Salvati and 
Carlucci 2014; Ogle et al. 2018; Crouzeilles et al. 2016; FAO 2016) (Sections 3.7 and 4.9).
In many regions, net forest area increase includes deforestation (often of native forests) alongside increasing forest area (often managed 
forest, but also more natural forest restoration efforts) (Heilmayr et al. 2016; Scheidel and Work 2018; Hua et al. 2018; Crouzeilles 
et al. 2016; Chazdon et al. 2016b). China and India have seen the largest net forest area increase, aiming to alleviate soil erosion, 
desertification and overgrazing (Ahrends et al. 2017; Cao et al. 2016; Deng et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2019) (Sections 3.7 and 4.9) but 
uncertainties in exact forest area changes remain large, mostly due to differences in methodology and forest classification (FAO 2015a; 
Song et al. 2018; Hansen et al. 2013; MacDicken et al. 2015).
What are the implications for ecosystems?
1. Implications for biogeochemical and biophysical processes
There is robust evidence and medium agreement that whilst forest area expansion increases ecosystem carbon storage, the magnitude 
of the increased stock depends on the type and length of former land use, forest type planted, and climatic regions (Bárcena et al. 2014; 
Poeplau et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2013; Li et al. 2012) (Section 4.3). While reforestation of former croplands increases net ecosystem 
carbon storage (Bernal et al. 2018; Lamb 2018), afforestation on native grassland results in reduction of soil carbon stocks, which can 
reduce or negate the net carbon benefits which are dominated by increases in biomass, dead wood and litter carbon pools (Veldman 
et al. 2015, 2017).
Forest vs non-forest lands differ in land surface reflectiveness of shortwave radiation and evapotranspiration (Anderson et al. 2011; 
Perugini et al. 2017) (Section 2.4). Evapotranspiration from forests during the growing season regionally cools the land surface and 
enhances cloud cover that reduces shortwave radiation reaching the land, an impact that is especially pronounced in the tropics. 
However, dark evergreen conifer-dominated forests have low surface reflectance, and tend to cause warming of the near-surface 
atmosphere compared to non-forest land, especially when snow cover is present such as in boreal regions (Duveiller et al. 2018; 
Alkama and Cescatti 2016; Perugini et al. 2017) (medium evidence, high agreement).
2. Implications for water balance
Evapotranspiration by forests reduces surface runoff and erosion of soil and nutrients (Salvati et al. 2014). Planting of fast-growing 
species in semi-arid regions or replacing natural grasslands with forest plantations can divert soil water resources to evapotranspiration 
from groundwater recharge (Silveira et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2016; Cao et al. 2016). Multiple cases are reported from China where 
afforestation programs, some with irrigation, without having been tailored to local precipitation conditions, resulted in water shortages 
and tree mortality (Cao et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Feng et al. 2016). Water shortages may create long-term water 
conflicts (Zheng et al. 2016). However, reforestation (in particular for restoration) is also associated with improved water filtration, 
groundwater recharge (Ellison et al. 2017) and can reduce risk of soil erosion, flooding, and associated disasters (Lee et al. 2018) 
(Section 4.9).
3. Implications for biodiversity
Impacts of forest area expansion on biodiversity depend mostly on the vegetation cover that is replaced: afforestation on natural 
non-tree-dominated ecosystems can have negative impacts on biodiversity (Abreu et al. 2017; Griffith et al. 2017; Veldman et al. 2015; 
Parr et al. 2014; Wilson et al. 2017; Hua et al. 2016; see also IPCC 1.5° report (2018)). Reforestation with monocultures of fast-growing, 
non-native trees has little benefit to biodiversity (Shimamoto et al. 2018; Hua et al. 2016). There are also concerns regarding some 
commonly used plantation species (e.g., Acacia and Pinus species) to become invasive (Padmanaba and Corlett 2014; Cunningham 
et al. 2015b).

Cross-Chapter Box 2 (continued)
Reforestation with mixes of native species, especially in areas that retain fragments of native forest, can support ecosystem services 
and biodiversity recovery, with positive social and environmental co-benefits (Cunningham et al. 2015a; Dendy et al. 2015; Chaudhary 
and Kastner 2016; Huang et al. 2018; Locatelli et al. 2015b) (Section 4.5). Even though species diversity in re-growing forests is typically 
lower than in primary forests, planting native or mixed species can have positive effects on biodiversity (Brockerhoff et al. 2013; 
Pawson et al. 2013; Thompson et al. 2014). Reforestation has been shown to improve links among existing remnant forest patches, 
increasing species movement, and fostering gene flow between otherwise isolated populations (Gilbert-Norton et al. 2010; Barlow 
et al. 2007; Lindenmayer and Hobbs 2004).
4. Implications for other ecosystem services and societies
Forest area expansion could benefit recreation and health, preservation of cultural heritage and local values and knowledge, livelihood 
support (via reduced resource conflicts, restoration of local resources). These social benefits could be most successfully achieved if 
local communities’ concerns are considered (Le et al. 2012). However, these co-benefits have rarely been assessed due to a lack of 
suitable frameworks and evaluation tools (Baral et al. 2016).
Industrial forest management can be in conflict with the needs of forest-dependent people and community-based forest management 
over access to natural resources (Gerber 2011; Baral et al. 2016) and/or loss of customary rights over land use (Malkamäki et al. 2018; 
Cotula et al. 2014). A common result is out-migration from rural areas and diminishing local uses of ecosystems (Gerber 2011). Policies 
promoting large-scale tree plantations gain traction if these are reappraised in view of potential co-benefits with several ecosystem 
services and local societies (Bull et al. 2006; Le et al. 2012).
Scenarios of forest area expansion for land-based climate change mitigation
Conversion of non-forest to forest land has been discussed as a relatively cost-effective climate change mitigation option when compared 
to options in the energy and transport sectors (medium evidence, medium agreement) (de Coninck et al. 2018; Griscom et al. 2017; 
Fuss et al. 2018), and can have co-benefits with adaptation.
Sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere through forest area expansion has become a fundamental part of stringent climate change 
mitigation scenarios (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Fuss et al. 2018) (e.g., Sections 2.5, 4.5 and 6.2). The estimated mitigation potential ranges 
from about 0.5 to 10 GtCO2 yr–1 (robust evidence, medium agreement), and depends on assumptions regarding available land and 
forest carbon uptake potential (Houghton 2013; Houghton and Nassikas 2017; Griscom et al. 2017; Lenton 2014; Fuss et al. 2018; 
Smith 2016) (Section 2.5.1). In climate change mitigation scenarios, typically, no differentiation is made between reforestation and 
afforestation despite different overall environmental impacts between these two measures. Likewise, biodiversity conservation, 
impacts on water balances, other ecosystem services, or land-ownership – as constraints when simulating forest area expansion 
(Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1) – tend not to be included as constraints when simulating forest area expansion.
Projected forest area increases, relative to today’s forest area, range from approximately 25% in 2050 and increase to nearly 50% by 
2100 (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Humpenoder et al. 2014). Potential adverse side-effects of such large-scale measures, 
especially for low-income countries, could be increasing food prices from the increased competition for land (Kreidenweis et al. 2016; 
Hasegawa et al. 2015, 2018; Boysen et al. 2017) (Section 5.5). Forests also emit large amounts of biogenic volatile compounds 
that under some conditions contribute to the formation of atmospherically short-lived climate forcing compounds, which are also 
detrimental to health (Ashworth et al. 2013; Harrison et al. 2013). Recent analyses argued for an upper limit of about 5 million km2 
of land globally available for climate change mitigation through reforestation, mostly in the tropics (Houghton 2013) – with potential 
regional co-benefits.
Since forest growth competes for land with bioenergy crops (Harper et al. 2018) (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6), global area 
estimates need to be assessed in light of alternative mitigation measures at a given location. In all forest-based mitigation efforts, 
the sequestration potential will eventually saturate unless the area keeps expanding, or harvested wood is either used for long-term 
storage products or for carbon capture and storage (Fuss et al. 2018; Houghton et al. 2015) (Section 2.5.1). Considerable uncertainty in 
forest carbon uptake estimates is further introduced by potential forest losses from fire or pest outbreaks (Allen et al. 2010; Anderegg 
et al. 2015) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2). And like all land-based mitigation measures, benefits may be diminshed by land-use 
displacement, and through trade of land-based products, especially in poor countries that experience forest loss (e.g., Africa) (Bhojvaid 
et al. 2016; Jadin et al. 2016).

1.3.2 
Land management
1.3.2.1 
Agricultural, forest and soil management
Sustainable land management (SLM) describes “the stewardship 
and use of land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, 
to meet changing human needs while simultaneously assuring 
the long-term productive potential of these resources and the 
maintenance of their environmental functions” (Alemu 2016; Altieri 
and Nicholls 2017) (e.g.,  Section  4.1.5), and includes ecological, 
technological and governance aspects.
The choice of SLM strategy is a  function of regional context 
and land-use types, with high agreement on (a combination of) 
choices such as agroecology (including agroforestry), conservation 
agriculture and forestry practices, crop and forest species diversity, 
appropriate crop and forest rotations, organic farming, integrated 
pest management, the preservation and protection of pollination 
services, rainwater harvesting, range and pasture management, and 
precision agriculture systems (Stockmann et al.  2013; Ebert, 2014; 
Schulte et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2015; Sunil and Pandravada 2015; 
Poeplau and Don 2015; Agus et al. 2015; Keenan 2015; MacDicken 
et al.  2015; Abberton et al.  2016). Conservation agriculture and 
forestry uses management practices with minimal soil disturbance 
such as no tillage or minimum tillage, permanent soil cover with 
mulch, combined with rotations to ensure a permanent soil surface, 
or rapid regeneration of forest following harvest (Hobbs et al. 2008; 
Friedrich et al. 2012). Vegetation and soils in forests and woodland 
ecosystems play a  crucial role in regulating critical ecosystem 
processes, therefore reduced deforestation together with sustainable 
forest management are integral to SLM (FAO 2015b) (Section 4.8). In 
some circumstances, increased demand for forest products can also 
lead to increased management of carbon storage in forests (Favero 
and Mendelsohn 2014). Precision agriculture is characterised by 
a “management system that is information and technology based, 
is site specific and uses one or more of the following sources of 
data: soils, crops, nutrients, pests, moisture, or yield, for optimum 
profitability, sustainability, and protection of the environment” 
(USDA 2007) (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5). The management 
of protected areas that reduce deforestation also plays an important 
role in climate change mitigation and adaptation while delivering 
numerous ecosystem services and sustainable development benefits 
(Bebber and Butt 2017). Similarly, when managed in an integrated 
and sustainable way, peatlands are also known to provide numerous 
ecosystem services, as well as socio-economic and mitigation and 
adaptation benefits (Ziadat et al. 2018).
Biochar is an organic compound used as soil amendment and is 
believed to be potentially an important global resource for mitigation. 
Enhancing the carbon content of soil and/or use of biochar (Chapter 4) 
have become increasingly important as a climate change mitigation 
option with possibly large co-benefits for other ecosystem services. 
Enhancing soil carbon storage and the addition of biochar can be 
practiced with limited competition for land, provided no productivity/
yield loss and abundant unused biomass, but evidence is limited and 
impacts of large scale application of biochar on the full GHG balance 
of soils, or human health are yet to be explored (Gurwick et al. 2013; 
Lorenz and Lal 2014; Smith 2016).
1.3.3 
Value chain management
1.3.3.1 
Supply management
Food losses from harvest to retailer. Approximately one-third of 
losses and waste in the food system occurs between crop production 
and food consumption, increasing substantially if losses in livestock 
production and overeating are included (Gustavsson et al.  2011; 
Alexander et al. 2017). This includes on-farm losses, farm to retailer 
losses, as well retailer and consumer losses (Section 1.3.3.2).
Post-harvest food loss  – on farm and from farm to retailer  – is 
a  widespread problem, especially in developing countries (Xue 
et al. 2017), but are challenging to quantify. For instance, averaged 
for eastern and southern Africa an estimated 10–17% of annual 
grain production is lost (Zorya et al.  2011). Across 84 countries 
and different time periods, annual median losses in the supply 
chain before retailing were estimated at about 28 kg per capita for 
cereals or about 12 kg per capita for eggs and dairy products (Xue 
et al. 2017). For the year 2013, losses prior to the reaching retailers 
were estimated at 20% (dry weight) of the production amount (22% 
wet weight) (Gustavsson et al. 2011; Alexander et al. 2017). While 
losses of food cannot be realistically reduced to zero, advancing 
harvesting technologies (Bradford et al. 2018; Affognon et al. 2015), 
Cross-Chapter Box 2 (continued)
Conclusion
Reforestation is a mitigation measure with potential co-benefits for conservation and adaptation, including biodiversity habitat, air 
and water filtration, flood control, enhanced soil fertility and reversal of land degradation. Potential adverse side-effects of forest 
area expansion depend largely on the state of the land it displaces as well as tree species selections. Active governance and planning 
contribute to maximising co-benefits while minimising adverse side-effects (Laestadius et al. 2011; Dinerstein et al. 2015; Veldman 
et al. 2017) (Section 4.8 and Chapter 7). At large spatial scales, forest expansion is expected to lead to increased competition for land, 
with potentially undesirable impacts on food prices, biodiversity, non-forest ecosystems and water availability (Bryan and Crossman 
2013; Boysen et al. 2017; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Egginton et al. 2014; Cao et al. 2016; Locatelli et al. 2015a; Smith et al. 2013).

storage capacity (Chegere 2018) and efficient transportation could 
all contribute to reducing these losses with co-benefits for food 
availability, the land area needed for food production and related 
GHG emissions.
Stability of food supply, transport and distribution. Increased 
climate variability enhances fluctuations in world food supply 
and price variability (Warren 2014; Challinor et al.  2015; Elbehri 
et al. 2017). ‘Food price shocks’ need to be understood regarding 
their transmission across sectors and borders and impacts on poor 
and food insecure populations, including urban poor subject to 
food deserts and inadequate food accessibility (Widener et al. 2017; 
Lehmann et al.  2013; Le 2016; FAO 2015b). Trade can play an 
important stabilising role in food supply, especially for regions with 
agro-ecological limits to production, including water scarce regions, 
as well as regions that experience short-term production variability 
due to climate, conflicts or other economic shocks (Gilmont 2015; 
Marchand et al. 2016). Food trade can either increase or reduce the 
overall environmental impacts of agriculture (Kastner et al. 2014). 
Embedded in trade are virtual transfers of water, land area, 
productivity, ecosystem services, biodiversity, or nutrients (Marques 
et al.  2019; Wiedmann and Lenzen 2018; Chaudhary and Kastner 
2016) with either positive or negative implications (Chen et al. 2018; 
Yu et al. 2013). Detrimental consequences in countries in which trade 
dependency may accentuate the risk of food shortages from foreign 
production shocks could be reduced by increasing domestic reserves 
or importing food from a  diversity of suppliers (Gilmont 2015; 
Marchand et al. 2016).
Climate mitigation policies could create new trade opportunities 
(e.g.,  biomass) (Favero and Massetti 2014) or alter existing trade 
patterns. The transportation GHG footprints of supply chains may 
be causing a differentiation between short and long supply chains 
(Schmidt et al.  2017) that may be influenced by both economics 
and policy measures (Section  5.4). In the absence of sustainable 
practices and when the ecological footprint is not valued through 
the market system, trade can also exacerbate resource exploitation 
and environmental leakages, thus weakening trade mitigation 
contributions (Dalin and Rodríguez-Iturbe 2016; Mosnier et al. 2014; 
Elbehri et al.  2017). Ensuring stable food supply while pursuing 
climate mitigation and adaptation will benefit from evolving trade 
rules and policies that allow internalisation of the cost of carbon 
(and costs of other vital resources such as water, nutrients). Likewise, 
future climate change mitigation policies would gain from measures 
designed to internalise the environmental costs of resources and the 
benefits of ecosystem services (Elbehri et al. 2017; Brown et al. 2007).
1.3.3.2 
Demand management
Dietary change. Demand-side solutions to climate mitigation are 
an essential complement to supply-side, technology and productivity 
driven solutions (high confidence) (Creutzig et al.  2016; Bajželj 
et al. 2014; Erb et al. 2016b; Creutzig et al. 2018) (Sections 5.5.1 
and 5.5.2). The environmental impacts of the animal-rich ‘western 
diets’ are being examined critically in the scientific literature (Hallström 
et al. 2015; Alexander et al. 2016b; Alexander et al. 2015; Tilman and 
Clark 2014; Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016; Poore and Nemecek 2018) 
(Section 5.4.6). For example, if the average diet of each country were 
consumed globally, the agricultural land area needed to supply these 
diets would vary 14-fold, due to country differences in ruminant 
protein and calorific intake (–55% to +178% compared to existing 
cropland areas). Given the important role enteric fermentation plays 
in methane (CH4) emissions, a number of studies have examined the 
implications of lower animal-protein diets (Swain et al. 2018; Röös 
et al. 2017; Rao et al. 2018). Reduction of animal protein intake has 
been estimated to reduce global green water (from precipitation) 
use by 11% and blue water (from rivers, lakes, groundwater) use 
by 6% (Jalava et al. 2014). By avoiding meat from producers with 
above-median GHG emissions and halving animal-product intake, 
consumption change could free-up 21  million km2 of agricultural 
land and reduce GHG emissions by nearly 5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 or up to 
10.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 when vegetation carbon uptake is considered on 
the previously agricultural land (Poore and Nemecek 2018, 2019).
Diets can be location and community specific, are rooted in culture 
and traditions while responding to changing lifestyles driven for 
instance by urbanisation and changing income. Changing dietary 
and consumption habits would require a combination of non-price 
(government procurement, regulations, education and awareness 
raising) and price incentives (Juhl and Jensen 2014) to induce 
consumer behavioural change with potential synergies between 
climate, health and equity (addressing growing global nutrition 
imbalances that emerge as undernutrition, malnutrition, and obesity) 
(FAO 2018b).
Reduced waste and losses in the food demand system. Global 
averaged per capita food waste and loss (FWL) have increased 
by 44% between 1961 and 2011 (Porter et al. 2016) and are now 
around 25–30% of global food produced (Kummu et al.  2012; 
Alexander et al.  2017). Food waste occurs at all stages of the 
food supply chain from the household to the marketplace (Parfitt 
et al. 2010) and is found to be larger at household than at supply 
chain levels. A meta-analysis of 55 studies showed that the highest 
share of food waste was at the consumer stage (43.9% of total) with 
waste increasing with per capita GDP for high-income countries 
until a plateaux at about 100 kg cap–1 yr–1 (around 16% of food 
consumption) above about 70,000 USD cap–1 (van der Werf and 
Gilliland 2017; Xue et al. 2017). Food loss from supply chains tends 
to be more prevalent in less developed countries where inadequate 
technologies, limited infrastructure, and imperfect markets combine 
to raise the share of the food production lost before use.
There are several causes behind food waste including economics 
(cheap food), food policies (subsidies) as well as individual behaviour 
(Schanes et al.  2018). Household level food waste arises from 
overeating or overbuying (Thyberg and Tonjes 2016). Globally, 
overconsumption was found to waste  9–10% of food bought 
(Alexander et al. 2017).
Solutions to FWL thus need to address technical and economic 
aspects. Such solutions would benefit from more accurate data on 
the loss-source, loss-magnitude and causes along the food supply 
chain. In the long run, internalising the cost of food waste into the 
product price would more likely induce a shift in consumer behaviour 
102
Chapter 1 
Framing and context

towards less waste and more nutritious, or alternative, food intake 
(FAO 2018b). Reducing FWL would bring a range of benefits for health, 
reducing pressures on land, water and nutrients, lowering emissions 
and safeguarding food security. Reducing food waste by 50% would 
generate net emissions reductions in the range of 20 to 30% of total 
food-sourced GHGs (Bajželj et al. 2014). SDG 12 (“Ensure sustainable 
consumption and production patterns”) calls for per capita global food 
waste to be reduced by one-half at the retail and consumer level, and 
reducing food losses along production and supply chains by 2030.
1.3.4 
Risk management
Risk management refers to plans, actions, strategies or policies 
to reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential 
consequences, based on assessed or perceived risks. Insurance and 
early warning systems are examples of risk management, but risk 
can also be reduced (or resilience enhanced) through a broad set 
of options ranging from seed sovereignty, livelihood diversification, 
to reducing land loss through urban sprawl. Early warning systems 
support farmer decision-making on management strategies 
(Section 1.2) and are a good example of an adaptation measure with 
mitigation co-benefits such as reducing carbon losses (Section 1.3.6). 
Primarily designed to avoid yield losses, early warning systems also 
support fire management strategies in forest ecosystems, which 
prevents financial as well as carbon losses (de Groot et al. 2015). 
Given that over recent decades on average around 10% of cereal 
production was lost through extreme weather events (Lesk 
et al. 2016), where available and affordable, insurance can buffer 
farmers and foresters against the financial losses incurred through 
such weather and other (fire, pests) extremes (Falco et al.  2014) 
(Sections 7.2 and 7.4). Decisions to take up insurance are influenced 
by a range of factors such as the removal of subsidies or targeted 
education (Falco et al.  2014). Enhancing access and affordability 
of insurance in low-income countries is a specific objective of the 
UNFCCC (Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler 2006). A global mitigation 
co-benefit of insurance schemes may also include incentives for 
future risk reduction (Surminski and Oramas-Dorta 2014).
1.3.5 
Economics of land-based mitigation  
pathways: Costs versus benefits of early 
action under uncertainty
The overarching societal costs associated with GHG emissions and 
the potential implications of mitigation activities can be measured 
by various metrics (cost-benefit analysis, cost effectiveness analysis) 
at different scales (project, technology, sector or the economy) (IPCC 
2018) (Section 1.4). The social cost of carbon (SCC) measures the total 
net damages of an extra metric tonne of CO2 emissions due to the 
associated climate change (Nordhaus 2014; Pizer et al. 2014). Both 
negative and positive impacts are monetised and discounted to arrive 
at the net value of consumption loss. As the SCC depends on discount 
rate assumptions and value judgements (e.g., relative weight given 
to current vs future generations), it is not a straightforward policy 
tool to compare alternative options. At the sectoral level, marginal 
abatement cost curves (MACCs) are widely used for the assessment 
of costs related to GHG emissions reduction. MACCs measure the 
cost of reducing one more GHG unit and are either expert-based or 
model-derived and offer a  range of approaches and assumptions 
on discount rates or available abatement technologies (Kesicki 
2013). In land-based sectors, Gillingham and Stock (2018) reported 
short-term static abatement costs for afforestation of between 
1 and 10 USD2017 per tCO2, soil management at 57 and livestock 
management at 71 USD2017 per tCO2. MACCs are more reliable 
when used to rank alternative options compared to a baseline (or 
business as usual) rather than offering absolute numerical measures 
(Huang et al. 2016). The economics of land-based mitigation options 
encompass also the “costs of inaction” that arise either from the 
economic damages due to continued accumulation of GHGs in the 
atmosphere and from the diminution in value of ecosystem services 
or the cost of their restoration where feasible (Rodriguez-Labajos 
2013; Ricke et al. 2018). Overall, it remains challenging to estimate 
the costs of alternative mitigation options owing to the context – 
and scale-specific interplay between multiple drivers (technological, 
economic, and socio-cultural) and enabling policies and institutions 
(IPCC 2018) (Section 1.4).
The costs associated with mitigation (both project-linked such as 
capital costs or land rental rates, or sometimes social costs) generally 
increase with stringent mitigation targets and over time. Sources of 
uncertainty include the future availability, cost and performance of 
technologies (Rosen and Guenther 2015; Chen et al. 2016) or lags 
in decision-making, which have been demonstrated by the uptake 
of land use and land utilisation policies (Alexander et al. 2013; Hull 
et al. 2015; Brown et al. 2018b). There is growing evidence of significant 
mitigation gains through conservation, restoration and improved land 
management practices (Griscom et al. 2017; Kindermann et al. 2008; 
Golub et al. 2013; Favero et al. 2017) (Chapters 4 and 6), but the 
mitigation cost efficiency can vary according to region and specific 
ecosystem (Albanito et al.  2016). Recent model developments 
that treat process-based, human–environment interactions have 
recognised feedbacks that reinforce or dampen the original stimulus 
for land-use change (Robinson et al. 2017; Walters and Scholes 2017). 
For instance, land mitigation interventions that rely on large-scale, 
land-use change (e.g., afforestation) would need to account for the 
rebound effect (which dampens initial impacts due to feedbacks) in 
which raising land prices also raises the cost of land-based mitigation 
(Vivanco et al. 2016). Although there are few direct estimates, indirect 
assessments strongly point to much higher costs if action is delayed or 
limited in scope (medium confidence). Quicker response options are 
also needed to avoid loss of high-carbon ecosystems and other vital 
ecosystem services that provide multiple services that are difficult to 
replace (peatlands, wetlands, mangroves, forests) (Yirdaw et al. 2017; 
Pedrozo-Acuña et al. 2015). Delayed action would raise relative costs 
in the future or could make response options less feasible (medium 
confidence) (Goldstein et al. 2019; Butler et al. 2014).
1.3.6 
Adaptation measures and scope for co-benefits 
with mitigation
Adaptation and mitigation have generally been treated as two 
separate discourses, both in policy and practice, with mitigation 
103
Framing and context  
Chapter 1

addressing cause and adaptation dealing with the consequences 
of climate change (Hennessey et al.  2017). While adaptation 
(e.g.,  reducing flood risks) and mitigation (e.g., reducing non-CO2 
emissions from agriculture) may have different objectives and 
operate at different scales, they can also generate joint outcomes 
(Locatelli et al.  2015b) with adaptation generating mitigation 
co-benefits. Seeking to integrate strategies for achieving adaptation 
and mitigation goals is attractive in order to reduce competition for 
limited resources and trade-offs (Lobell et al. 2013; Berry et al. 2015; 
Kongsager and Corbera 2015). Moreover, determinants that can 
foster adaptation and mitigation practices are similar. These tend to 
include available technology and resources, and credible information 
for policymakers to act on (Yohe 2001).
Four sets of mitigation–adaptation interrelationships can be 
distinguished: (i) mitigation actions that can result in adaptation 
benefits; (ii) adaptation actions that have mitigation benefits; 
(iii)  processes that have implications for both adaptation and 
mitigation; and (iv) strategies and policy processes that seek to 
promote an integrated set of responses for both adaptation and 
mitigation (Klein et al. 2007). A high level of adaptive capacity is a key 
ingredient to developing successful mitigation policy. Implementing 
mitigation action can result in increasing resilience especially if it is 
able to reduce risks. Yet, mitigation and adaptation objectives, scale 
of implementation, sector and even metrics to identify impacts tend 
to differ (Ayers and Huq 2009), and institutional setting, often does 
not enable an environment where synergies are sought (Kongsager 
et al. 2016). Trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation exist as 
well and need to be understood (and avoided) to establish win-win 
situations (Porter et al. 2014; Kongsager et al. 2016).
Forestry and agriculture offer a wide range of lessons for the integration 
of adaptation and mitigation actions given the vulnerability of forest 
ecosystems or cropland to climate variability and change (Keenan 
2015; Gaba et al. 2015) (Sections 5.6 and 4.8). Increasing adaptive 
capacity in forested areas has the potential to prevent deforestation 
and forest degradation (Locatelli et al. 2011). Reforestation projects, if 
well managed, can increase community economic opportunities that 
encourage conservation (Nelson and de Jong 2003), build capacity 
through training of farmers and installation of multifunctional 
plantations with income generation (Reyer et al. 2009), strengthen 
local institutions (Locatelli et al. 2015a) and increase cash-flow to 
local forest stakeholders from foreign donors (West 2016). A forest 
plantation that sequesters carbon for mitigation can also reduce 
water availability to downstream populations and heighten their 
vulnerability to drought. Inversely, not recognising mitigation in 
adaptation projects may yield adaptation measures that increase 
greenhouse gas emissions, a  prime example of ‘maladaptation’. 
Analogously, ‘mal-mitigation’ would result in reducing GHG 
emissions, but increasing vulnerability (Barnett and  O’Neill 2010; 
Porter et al.  2014). For instance, the cost of pursuing large-scale 
adaptation and mitigation projects has been associated with higher 
failure risks, onerous transactions costs and the complexity of 
managing big projects (Swart and Raes 2007).
Adaptation encompasses both biophysical and socio-economic 
vulnerability and underlying causes (informational, capacity, 
financial, institutional, and technological; Huq et al. 2014) and it is 
increasingly linked to resilience and to broader development goals 
(Huq et al. 2014). Adaptation measures can increase performance of 
mitigation projects under climate change and legitimise mitigation 
measures through the more immediately felt effects of adaptation 
(Locatelli et al. 2011; Campbell et al. 2014; Locatelli et al. 2015b). 
Effective climate policy integration in the land sector is expected to gain 
from (i) internal policy coherence between adaptation and mitigation 
objectives, (ii) external climate coherence between climate change 
and development objectives, (iii) policy integration that favours 
vertical governance structures to foster effective mainstreaming 
of climate change into sectoral policies, and (iv) horizontal policy 
integration through overarching governance structures to enable 
cross-sectoral coordination (Sections 1.4 and 7.4).
1.4 
Enabling the response
Climate change and sustainable development are challenges to 
society that require action at local, national, transboundary and 
global scales. Different time-perspectives are also important in 
decision-making, ranging from immediate actions to long-term 
planning and investment. Acknowledging the systemic link between 
food production and consumption, and land-resources more broadly 
is expected to enhance the success of actions (Bazilian et al. 2011; 
Hussey and Pittock 2012). Because of the complexity of challenges 
and the diversity of actors involved in addressing these challenges, 
decision-making would benefit from a portfolio of policy instruments. 
Decision-making would also be facilitated by overcoming barriers 
such as inadequate education and funding mechanisms, as well as 
integrating international decisions into all relevant (sub)national 
sectoral policies (Section 7.4).
‘Nexus thinking’ emerged as an alternative to the sector-specific 
governance of natural resource use to achieve global securities of 
water (D’Odorico et al.  2018), food and energy (Hoff 2011; Allan 
et al.  2015), and also to address biodiversity concerns (Fischer 
et al. 2017). Yet, there is no agreed definition of “nexus” nor a uniform 
framework to approach the concept, which may be land-focused 
(Howells et al.  2013), water-focused (Hoff 2011) or food-centred 
(Ringler and Lawford 2013; Biggs et al. 2015). Significant barriers 
remain to establish nexus approaches as part of a wider repertoire 
of responses to global environmental change, including challenges 
to cross-disciplinary collaboration, complexity, political economy 
and the incompatibility of current institutional structures (Hayley 
et al. 2015; Wichelns 2017) (Sections 7.5.6 and 7.6.2).
1.4.1 
Governance to enable the response
Governance includes the processes, structures, rules and traditions 
applied by formal and informal actors including governments, 
markets, organisations, and their interactions with people. Land 
governance actors include those affecting policies and markets, and 
those directly changing land use (Hersperger et al. 2010). The former 
includes governments and administrative entities, large companies 
investing in land, non-governmental institutions and international 
104
Chapter 1 
Framing and context

institutions. It also includes UN agencies that are working at the 
interface between climate change and land management, such 
as the FAO and the World Food Programme that have inter alia 
worked on advancing knowledge to support food security through 
the improvement of techniques and strategies for more resilient 
farm systems. Farmers and foresters directly act on land (actors in 
proximate causes) (Hersperger et al. 2010) (Chapter 7).
Policy design and formulation has often been strongly sectoral. For 
example, agricultural policy might be concerned with food security, 
but have little concern for environmental protection or human 
health. As food, energy and water security and the conservation 
of biodiversity rank highly on the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable 
Development, the promotion of synergies between and across 
sectoral policies is important (IPBES 2018a). This can also reduce 
the risks of anthropogenic climate forcing through mitigation, and 
bring greater collaboration between scientists, policymakers, the 
private sector and land managers in adapting to climate change 
(FAO 2015a). Polycentric governance (Section 7.6) has emerged as 
an appropriate way of handling resource management problems, 
in which the decision-making centres take account of one another 
in competitive and cooperative relationships and have recourse to 
conflict resolution mechanisms (Carlisle and Gruby 2017). Polycentric 
governance is also multi-scale and allows the interaction between 
actors at different levels (local, regional, national and global) in 
managing common pool resources such as forests or aquifers.
Implementation of systemic, nexus approaches has been achieved 
through socio-ecological systems (SES) frameworks that emerged 
from studies of how institutions affect human incentives, actions and 
outcomes (Ostrom and Cox 2010). Recognition of the importance 
of SES laid the basis for alternative formulations to tackle the 
sustainable management of land resources focusing specifically on 
institutional and governance outcomes (Lebel et al.  2006; Bodin 
2017). The SES approach also addresses the multiple scales in which 
the social and ecological dimensions interact (Veldkamp et al. 2011; 
Myers et al. 2016; Azizi et al. 2017) (Section 6.1).
Adaptation or resilience pathways within the SES frameworks require 
several attributes, including indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) 
and trust building for deliberative decision-making and effective 
collective action, polycentric and multi-layered institutions and 
responsible authorities that pursue just distributions of benefits 
to enhance the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups and 
communities (Lebel et al.  2006). The nature, source and mode 
of knowledge generation are critical to ensure that sustainable 
solutions are community-owned and fully integrated within the 
local context (Mistry and Berardi 2016; Schneider and Buser 2018). 
Integrating ILK with scientific information is a prerequisite for such 
community-owned solutions (Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 7). 
ILK is context-specific, transmitted orally or through imitation and 
demonstration, adaptive to changing environments, and collectivised 
through a shared social memory (Mistry and Berardi 2016). ILK is 
also holistic since indigenous people do not seek solutions aimed 
at adapting to climate change alone, but instead look for solutions 
to increase their resilience to a wide range of shocks and stresses 
(Mistry and Berardi 2016). ILK can be deployed in the practice of 
climate governance, especially at the local level where actions are 
informed by the principles of decentralisation and autonomy (Chanza 
and de Wit 2016). ILK need not be viewed as needing confirmation or 
disapproval by formal science, but rather it can complement scientific 
knowledge (Klein et al. 2014).
The capacity to apply individual policy instruments and policy mixes 
is influenced by governance modes. These modes include hierarchical 
governance that is centralised and imposes policy through top-down 
measures, decentralised governance in which public policy is 
devolved to regional or local government, public-private partnerships 
that aim for mutual benefits for the public and private sectors and 
self or private governance that involves decisions beyond the realms 
of the public sector (IPBES 2018a). These governance modes provide 
both constraints and opportunities for key actors that impact the 
effectiveness, efficiency and equity of policy implementation.
1.4.2 
Gender agency as a critical factor in climate 
and land sustainability outcomes
Environmental resource management is not gender neutral. Gender 
is an essential variable in shaping ecological processes and change, 
building better prospects for livelihoods and sustainable development 
(Resurrección 2013) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7). Entrenched 
legal and social structures and power relations constitute additional 
stressors that render women’s experience of natural resources 
disproportionately negative when compared to men. Socio-economic 
drivers and entrenched gender inequalities affect land-based 
management (Agarwal 2010). The intersections between climate 
change, gender and climate adaptation takes place at multiple scales: 
household, national and international, and adaptive capacities are 
shaped through power and knowledge.
Germaine to the gender inequities is the unequal access to land-based 
resources. Women play a significant role in agriculture (Boserup 1989; 
Darity 1980) and rural economies globally (FAO 2011), but are well 
below their share of labour in agriculture globally (FAO 2011). In 
59% of 161 surveyed countries, customary, traditional and religious 
practices hinder women’s land rights (OECD 2014). Moreover, women 
typically shoulder disproportionate responsibility for unpaid domestic 
work including care-giving activities (Beuchelt and Badstue 2013) 
and the provision of water and firewood (UNEP 2016). Exposure to 
violence restricts, in large regions, their mobility for capacity-building 
activities and productive work outside the home (Day et al. 2005; UNEP 
2016). Large-scale development projects can erode rights, and lead to 
over-exploitation of natural resources. Hence, there are cases where 
reforms related to land-based management, instead of enhancing 
food security, have tended to increase the vulnerability of both women 
and men and reduce their ability to adapt to climate change (Pham 
et al. 2016). Access to, and control over, land and land-based resources 
is essential in taking concrete action on land-based mitigation, and 
inadequate access can affect women’s rights and participation in land 
governance and management of productive assets.
Timely information, such as from early warning systems, is critical 
in managing risks, disasters, and land degradation, and in enabling 
105
Framing and context  
Chapter 1

land-based adaptation. Gender, household resources and social 
status, are all determinants that influence the adoption of land-based 
strategies (Theriault et al. 2017). Climate change is not a lone driver 
in the marginalisation of women; their ability to respond swiftly to its 
impacts will depend on other socio-economic drivers that may help 
or hinder action towards adaptive governance. Empowering women 
and removing gender-based inequities constitutes a  mechanism 
for greater participation in the adoption of sustainable practices of 
land management (Mello and Schmink 2017). Improving women’s 
access to land (Arora-Jonsson 2014) and other resources (water) 
and means of economic livelihoods (such as credit and finance) are 
the prerequisites to enable women to participate in governance and 
decision-making structures (Namubiru-Mwaura 2014). Still, women 
are not a  homogenous group, and distinctions through elements 
of ethnicity, class, age and social status, require a  more nuanced 
approach and not a  uniform treatment through vulnerability 
lenses only. An intersectional approach that accounts for various 
social identifiers under different situations of power (Rao 2017) is 
considered suitable to integrate gender into climate change research 
and helps to recognise overlapping and interdependent systems of 
power (Djoudi et al.  2016; Kaijser and Kronsell 2014; Moosa and 
Tuana 2014; Thompson-Hall et al. 2016).
1.4.3 
Policy instruments
Policy instruments enable governance actors to respond to 
environmental and societal challenges through policy action. 
Examples of the range of policy instruments available to public 
policymakers are discussed below based on four categories of 
instruments: (i) legal and regulatory instruments, (ii) rights-based 
instruments and customary norms, (iii) economic and financial 
instruments, and (iv) social and cultural instruments.
1.4.3.1 
Legal and regulatory instruments
Legal and regulatory instruments deal with all aspects of intervention 
by public policy organisations to correct market failures, expand 
market reach, or intervene in socially relevant areas with inexistent 
markets. Such instruments can include legislation to limit the impacts 
of intensive land management, for example, protecting areas that 
are susceptible to nitrate pollution or soil erosion. Such instruments 
can also set standards or threshold values, for example, mandated 
water quality limits, organic production standards, or geographically 
defined regional food products. Legal and regulatory instruments 
may also define liability rules, for example, where environmental 
standards are not met, as well as establishing long-term agreements 
for land resource protection with land owners and land users.
1.4.3.2 
Economic and financial instruments
Economic (such as taxes, subsidies) and financial (weather-index 
insurance) instruments deal with the many ways in which public policy 
organisations can intervene in markets. A  number of instruments 
are available to support climate mitigation actions including public 
provision, environmental regulations, creating property rights 
and markets (Sterner 2003). Market-based policies such as carbon 
taxes, fuel taxes, cap and trade systems or green payments have 
been promoted (mostly in industrial economies) to encourage 
markets and businesses to contribute to climate mitigation, but their 
effectiveness to date has not always matched expectations (Grolleau 
et al. 2016) (Section 7.4.4). Market-based instruments in ecosystem 
services generate both positive (incentives for conservation), but 
also negative environmental impacts, and also push food prices up 
or increase price instability (Gómez-Baggethun and Muradian 2015; 
Farley and Voinov 2016). Footprint labels can be an effective means 
of shifting consumer behaviour. However, private labels focusing 
on a single metric (e.g., carbon) may give misleading signals if they 
target a portion of the life cycle (e.g., transport) (Appleton 2009) 
or ignore other ecological indicators (water, nutrients, biodiversity) 
(van Noordwijk and Brussaard 2014).
Effective and durable, market-led responses for climate mitigation 
depend on business models that internalise the cost of emissions into 
economic calculations. Such ‘business transformation’ would itself 
require integrated policies and strategies that aim to account for 
emissions in economic activities (Biagini and Miller 2013; Weitzman 
2014; Eidelwein et al. 2018). International initiatives such as REDD+ 
and agricultural commodity roundtables (beef, soybeans, palm oil, 
sugar) are expanding the scope of private sector participation in 
climate mitigation (Nepstad et al. 2013), but their impacts have not 
always been effective (Denis et al. 2014). Payments for environmental 
services (PES) defined as “voluntary transactions between service 
users and service providers that are conditional on agreed rules 
of natural resource management for generating offsite services” 
(Wunder 2015) have not been widely adopted and have not yet been 
demonstrated to deliver as effectively as originally hoped (Börner 
et al. 2017) (Sections 7.4 and 7.5). PES in forestry were shown to be 
effective only when coupled with appropriate regulatory measures 
(Alix-Garcia and Wolff 2014). Better designed and expanded 
PES schemes would encourage integrated soil–water–nutrient 
management packages (Stavi et al.  2016), services for pollinator 
protection (Nicole 2015), water use governance under scarcity, and 
engage both public and private actors (Loch et al. 2013). Effective 
PES also requires better economic metrics to account for human-
directed losses in terrestrial ecosystems and to food potential, and 
to address market failures or externalities unaccounted for in market 
valuation of ecosystem services.
Resilient strategies for climate adaptation can rely on the construction 
of markets through social networks as in the case of livestock 
systems (Denis et al.  2014) or when market signals encourage 
adaptation through land markets or supply chain incentives for 
sustainable land management practices (Anderson et al.  2018). 
Adequate policy (through regulations, investments in research and 
development or support to social capabilities) can support private 
initiatives for effective solutions to restore degraded lands (Reed and 
Stringer 2015), or mitigate against risk and to avoid shifting risks to 
the public (Biagini and Miller 2013). Governments, private business, 
and community groups could also partner to develop sustainable 
production codes (Chartres and Noble 2015), and in co-managing 
land-based resources (Baker and Chapin 2018), while public-private 
partnerships can be effective mechanisms in deploying infrastructure 
to cope with climatic events (floods) and for climate-indexed 
106

insurance (Kunreuther 2015). Private initiatives that depend on 
trade for climate adaptation and mitigation require reliable trading 
systems that do not impede climate mitigation objectives (Elbehri 
et al. 2015; Mathews 2017).
1.4.3.3 
Rights-based instruments and customary norms
Rights-based instruments and customary norms deal with the 
equitable and fair management of land resources for all people 
(IPBES 2018a). These instruments emphasise the rights in particular 
of indigenous peoples and local communities, including for example, 
recognition of the rights embedded in the access to, and use of, 
common land. Common land includes situations without legal 
ownership (e.g., hunter-gathering communities in South America or 
Africa, and bushmeat), where the legal ownership is distinct from 
usage rights (Mediterranean transhumance grazing systems), or 
mixed ownership-common grazing systems (e.g., crofting in Scotland). 
A lack of formal (legal) ownership has often led to the loss of access 
rights to land, where these rights were also not formally enshrined in 
law, which especially effects indigenous communities, for example, 
deforestation in the Amazon basin. Overcoming the constraints 
associated with common-pool resources (forestry, fisheries, water) 
are often of economic and institutional nature (Hinkel et al. 2014) 
and require tackling the absence or poor functioning of institutions 
and the structural constraints that they engender through access 
and control levers using policies and markets and other mechanisms 
(Schut et al.  2016). Other examples of rights-based instruments 
include the protection of heritage sites, sacred sites and peace parks 
(IPBES 2018a). Rights-based instruments and customary norms are 
consistent with the aims of international and national human rights, 
and the critical issue of liability in the climate change problem.
1.4.3.4 
Social and cultural norms
Social and cultural instruments are concerned with the 
communication of knowledge about conscious consumption patterns 
and resource-effective ways of life through awareness raising, 
education and communication of the quality and the provenance 
of land-based products. Examples of the latter include consumption 
choices aided by ecolabelling (Section 1.4.3.2) and certification. 
Cultural indicators (such as social capital, cooperation, gender 
equity, women’s knowledge,  socio-ecological mobility) contribute 
to the resilience of social-ecological systems (Sterling et al. 2017). 
Indigenous communities (such as the Inuit and Tsleil Waututh Nation 
in Canada) that continue to maintain traditional foods exhibit greater 
dietary quality and adequacy (Sheehy et al. 2015). Social and cultural 
instruments also include approaches to self-regulation and voluntary 
agreements, especially with respect to environmental management 
and land resource use. This is becoming especially irrelevant for the 
increasingly important domain of corporate social responsibility 
(Halkos and Skouloudis 2016).
1.5 
The interdisciplinary nature of the SRCCL
Assessing the land system in view of the multiple challenges that are 
covered by the SRCCL requires a broad, inter-disciplinary perspective. 
Methods, core concepts and definitions are used differently in different 
sectors, geographic regions, and across academic communities 
addressing land systems, and these concepts and approaches to 
research are also undergoing a change in their interpretation through 
time. These differences reflect varying perspectives, in nuances or 
emphasis, on land as components of the climate and socio-economic 
systems. Because of its inter-disciplinary nature, the SRCCL can take 
advantage of these varying perspectives and the diverse methods 
that accompany them. That way, the report aims to support decision-
makers across sectors and world regions in the interpretation of its 
main findings and support the implementation of solutions.

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 1.1 | 
What are the approaches to study the interactions between land and climate?
Climate change shapes the way land is able to support supply of food and water for humans. At the same time the land surface 
interacts with the overlying atmosphere, thus human modifications of land use, land cover and urbanisation affect global, regional 
and local climate. The complexity of the land–climate interactions requires multiple study approaches embracing different spatial 
and temporal scales. Observations of land atmospheric exchanges, such as of carbon, water, nutrients and energy can be carried 
out at leaf level and soil with gas exchange systems, or at canopy scale by means of micrometeorological techniques (i.e. eddy 
covariance). At regional scale, atmospheric measurements by tall towers, aircraft and satellites can be combined with atmospheric 
transport models to obtain spatial explicit maps of relevant greenhouse gases fluxes. At longer temporal scale (>10 years) other 
approaches are more effective, such as tree-ring chronologies, satellite records, population and vegetation dynamics and isotopic 
studies. Models are important to bring information from measurement together and to extend the knowledge in space and time, 
including the exploration of scenarios of future climate–land interactions.
FAQ 1.2 | 
 How region-specific are the impacts of different land-based adaptation 
and mitigation options?
Land-based adaptation and mitigation options are closely related to region-specific features for several reasons. Climate change 
has a definite regional pattern with some regions already suffering from enhanced climate extremes and others being impacted 
little, or even benefiting. From this point of view increasing confidence in regional climate change scenarios is becoming a critical 
step forward towards the implementation of adaptation and mitigation options. Biophysical and socio-economic impacts 
of climate change depend on the exposures of natural ecosystems and economic sectors, which are again specific to a region, 
reflecting regional sensitivities due to governance. The overall responses in terms of adaptation or mitigation capacities to avoid 
and reduce vulnerabilities and enhance adaptive capacity, depend on institutional arrangements, socio-economic conditions, and 
implementation of policies, many of them having definite regional features. However global drivers, such as agricultural demand, 
food prices, changing dietary habits associated with rapid social transformations (i.e. urban vs rural, meat-eating vs vegetarian) may 
interfere with region-specific policies for mitigation and adaptation options and need to be addressed at the global level.
FAQ 1.3 | 
 What is the difference between desertification and land degradation? 
And where are they happening?
The difference between land degradation and desertification is geographic. Land degradation is a general term used to describe 
a negative trend in land condition caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes (including anthropogenic climate change). 
Degradation can be identified by the long-term reduction or loss in biological productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans. 
Desertification is land degradation when it occurs in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas, which are also called drylands. 
Contrary to some perceptions, desertification is not the same as the expansion of deserts. Desertification is also not limited to 
irreversible forms of land degradation.

Table Appendix 1.2 |  Possible uncertainties decision-making faces (following Hansson and Hadorn 2016).
Type
Knowledge gaps
Understanding the uncertainties
Uncertainty of consequences
Do the model(s) adequately represent the target system?
What are the numerical values of input parameters, boundary conditions, 
or initial conditions?
What are all potential events that we would take into account if we were aware 
of them? Will future events relevant for our decisions, including expected impacts 
from these decisions, in fact take place?
Ensemble approaches; downscaling
Benchmarking, sensitivity analyses
Scenario approaches
Moral uncertainty
How to (ethically) evaluate the decisions?
What values to base the decision on (often unreliable ranking of values not doing 
justice to the range of values at stake, see Sen 1992), including choice of discount 
rate, risk attitude (risk aversion, risk neutral, …).
Which ethical principles? (i.e. utilitarian, deontic, virtue, or other?).
Possibly scenario analysis;
Identification of lock-in effects and 
path-dependency (e.g., Kinsley et al. 2016)
Uncertainty of demarcation
What are the options that we can actually choose between? (not fully known 
because ‘decision costs’ may be high, or certain options are not ‘seen’ as they 
are outside current ideologies).
How can the mass of decisions be divided into individual decisions? e.g., how this 
influences international negotiations and the question who does what and when 
(cp. Hammond et al. 1999).
Possibly scenario analysis
Uncertainty of consequences 
and uncertainty of 
demarcation
What effects does a decision have when combined with the decisions of others? 
(e.g., other countries may follow the inspiring example in climate reduction of 
country X, or they may use it solely in their own economic interest).
Games
Uncertainty of demarcation 
and moral uncertainty
How would we decide in the future? (Spohn 1977; Rabinowicz 2002).
