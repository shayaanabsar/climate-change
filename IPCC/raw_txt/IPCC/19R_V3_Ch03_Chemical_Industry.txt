TIER 1 METHOD 
It is good practice to use the highest emission factor based on the technology type shown in Table 3.3 and to 
assume that there is no abatement of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. 
TIER 2 METHOD 
If plant-level factors are not available, it is good practice to use default factors. These default values often 
represent midpoint or mean values of data sets (as determined by expert analysis). The extent to which they 
represent a specific plant’s emission rate is unknown. Default factors in Table 3.3 should be used only in cases 
where plant-specific measurements are not available. 
Table 3.3 includes emission factors for N2O, and associated uncertainties by type of production process.  
The five production process types are distinguished according to the pressures applied in the oxidation and 
absorption stage as presented in Table 3.3a (new).

The factors listed in Table 3.3 for plants using abatement technology, incorporate the effect of N2O abatement 
measures. To use these factors, inventory compilers should verify that the abatement technology is installed at 
individual plants and operated throughout the year.

TIER 3 METHOD 
Plant measurements provide the most rigorous data for calculating net emissions (i.e., N2O generation and 
destruction factors). Monitoring N2O emissions from nitric acid production is practical because these are point 
sources and there are a finite number of production plants. Given currently available technology, instrumentation 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 
for sampling and monitoring emission rates do not limit precision or accuracy of the overall measurement. 
Usually sampling frequency and timing is sufficient to avoid systematic errors and to achieve the desired level of 
accuracy. 
As a general rule, it is good practice to conduct sampling and analysis whenever a plant makes any significant 
process changes that would affect the generation rate of N2O, and sufficiently often otherwise to ensure that 
operating conditions are constant. In addition, plant operators should be consulted annually to determine the 
specific destruction technologies employed and confirm their use, since technologies may change over time. 
Precise measurement of the emissions rate and abatement efficiencies requires measurement of both the exit 
stream and the uncontrolled stream. Where measurement data are available only on the exit stream, good 
practice is to base emissions on these data. In this case, any available estimates of abatement efficiency should 
be provided only for information purposes and are not used to calculate emissions.

FLUOROCHEMICAL PRODUCTION 
3.10.1 HFC-23 emission from HCFC-22 production 
3.10.1.1 INTRODUCTION 
No refinement. 
3.10.1.2 METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
There are two broad measurement approaches to estimating HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 plants. These are 
described in IPCC (2000), DEFRA (2002a and 2002b), EFCTC (2003) and UN (2004) and have been translated 
into Tier 2 and 3 methodologies described below. National emissions using either of these methodologies are the 
sum of those from the individual facilities. Tier 1 (default) methodology can be applied to individual plants or, if 
there is no abatement by destruction, to the total national output of HCFC-22. Accounting for HFC-23 emissions 
is not simply mechanistic but requires information on the process operations responsible for producing and 
emitting HFC-23, so that the most appropriate methodology and factors can be adopted. Therefore, it is good 
practice, to the extent possible, to establish contacts with plant managers in order to obtain the necessary data. 
The Tier 1 method is relatively simple, involving the application of a default emission factor to the quantity of 
HCFC-22 produced. This method can be applied at the plant level or the national level. Tier 2 and Tier 3 
methodologies are suitable only for plant level calculations because they rely on data that are only available from 
plants. In cases where there are Tier 3 data available for some plants, the Tier 1 or Tier 2 methods can be applied 
to the remainder to ensure complete coverage.   
It is good practice to estimate national emissions by summing measured parameters from all HCFC-22 plants in 
a country. Tier 3 plant emission measurements are the most accurate, followed by Tier 2 measurements based on 
plant efficiencies. Direct measurement is significantly more accurate than Tier 1 because it reflects the 
conditions specific to each manufacturing facility. In most cases, the data necessary to prepare Tier 3 estimates 
should be available because facilities operating to good business practice perform regular or periodic sampling of 
the final process vent or within the process itself as part of routine operations. The Tier 1 (default) method 
should be used only in cases where plant-specific data are unavailable and this subcategory is not identified as 
significant subcategory under key category. (See Section 4.2 of Volume 1.) Modern plant using process 
optimization will need to keep accurate HFC-23 generation data as part of this optimization, so plant-specific 
data should be available to most countries in most cases. 
The choice of good practice method will depend on national circumstances. The decision tree in Figure 3.16 
describes good practice in adapting the methods in these Guidelines to country-specific circumstances. 
Procedures to abate emissions include destruction of HFC-23 in a discrete facility and, in this case, emissions 
occur only when the destruction facility is not in operation. The tiers of methodology provide estimates for the 
quantity of HFC-23 that is produced and the share of production that is ultimately emitted depends on the length 
of time that the destruction facility is not operated.  For facilities using abatement techniques such as HFC-23 
destruction, verification of the abatement efficiency is also done routinely. It is good practice to subtract abated 
HFC-23 emissions from national estimates where the abatement has been verified by process records on every 
plant. 
Tier 1 
In the Tier 1 methodology, a default factor is used to estimate production (and potential emissions) of HFC-23 
from the total HCFC-22 production from each facility (for both potentially dispersive uses, as reported under the 
Montreal Protocol, and feedstock uses, which are reported separately to the Ozone Secretariat). See Equation 
3.30.

PHCFC-22 
= total HCFC-22 production, kg 
This methodology is suitable where plant-specific measurements are not available and, in that case, the default 
condition is that all of the estimated HFC-23 production is released into the atmosphere. 
 
Tier 2 
In the Tier 2 methodology, the HFC-23 emission factor is derived from records of process efficiencies and used 
in the calculation shown as Equation 3.31. This is a material balance approach and relies on calculating the 
difference between the expected production of HCFC-22 and the actual production and then assigning that 
difference to loss of raw materials, loss of product (HCFC-22) and conversion to by-products, including HFC-23. 
These parameters will be different for each plant and so should be assessed separately for each facility reporting 
into the national data.

The emission factor can be calculated from both the carbon efficiency (Equation 3.32) and the fluorine efficiency 
(Equation 3.33) and the value used in Equation 3.31 should normally be the average of these two values unless 
there are overriding considerations (such as a much lower uncertainty of one of the efficiency measures) that can 
be adequately documented. Annual average carbon and fluorine balance efficiencies are features of a well-
managed HCFC-22 plant and are either normally available to the plant operator or may be obtained by 
examination of process accounting records.  Similarly, if there is a vent treatment system, the length of time that 
this was in operation, and treating the vent stream from the HCFC-22 plant, should be available from records. 
Total HCFC-22 production includes material that is used as a chemical feedstock as well as that which is sold for 
potentially dispersive uses.

The factor to assign the efficiency loss to HFC-23 is specific to each plant and, if this method of calculation is 
used, the factor should have been established by the process operator. By default, the value is 1; that is all of the 
loss in efficiency is due to co-production of HFC-23. In practice, this is commonly the most significant 
efficiency loss, being much larger than losses of raw materials or products. 
The factors for carbon and fluorine contents are calculated from the molecular compositions of HFC-23 and 
HCFC-22 and are common to all HCFC-22 plants at 0.81 for carbon and 0.54 for fluorine. 
 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methodologies are potentially the most accurate. The Tier 3 methodologies provided here give equivalent 
results and the choice between them will be dictated by the information available in individual facilities. In each 
case, the national emission is the sum of factory specific emissions, each of which may be determined using a 
Tier 3 method to estimate the composition and flowrate of gas streams vented to atmosphere (either directly and 
continuously – as in Tier 3a - or by continuous monitoring of a process parameter related to the emission - Tier 
3b - or by monitoring the HFC-23 concentration continuously within the reactor product stream - Tier 3c):

Tier 3a 
The Tier 3a method is based on frequent or continuous measurement of the concentration and flow-rate from the 
vent at an individual plant. So that the quantity emitted to atmosphere is the mathematical product of the mass 
concentration of the component in the stream, the flowrate of the total stream (in units compatible with the mass 
concentration) and the length of time that this flow occurred:

If any HFC-23 is recovered from the vent stream for use as chemical feedstock, and hence destroyed, it should 
be discounted from this emission; material recovered for uses where it may be emitted may be discounted here, if 
the emissions are included in the quantity calculated by the methods in Chapter 7. Because emissions are 
measured directly in this tier, it is not necessary to have a separate term for material recovered, unlike Tiers 3b 
and 3c. 
The total quantity of HFC-23 released is then the annual sum of these measured instantaneous releases. Periods 
when the vent stream is processed in a destruction unit to remove HFC-23 should not be counted in this 
calculation. If it is necessary to estimate the quantity destroyed at each facility, the operator should calculate this 
based on the difference between the operating time of the plant and the duration of release (t above). 
Tier 3b 
In many cases, measurements are not continuous but were gained during an intensive process survey or plant 
trial, and the results of the trial may be used to provide an emission factor for calculating emissions during 
normal plant operation. In this case, the emission rate of the by-product is related to a more easily (or accurately) 
measurable parameter, such as feedstock flow rate. The trial(s) must meet the following conditions: 
• 
There should have been no major process design, construction or operating changes that affect the plant 
upstream of the measurement point and so could render relationships between emissions and production 
invalid. (See also Box 3.14) 
• 
The relationship between emissions and plant operating rate must be established during the trial(s), together 
with its uncertainty. 
For almost all cases the rate of plant operation is a suitable process operating parameter and the quantity of HFC-
23 emitted depends on the current plant operating rate and the length of time that the vent flow was released.

Tier 3c 
It is a relatively simple procedure to monitor the concentration of HFC-23 in the product of a reaction system 
relative to the amount of HCFC-22. This provides a basis for estimation of the quantity of HFC-23 released as 
the mathematical product of the monitored concentration and the mass flow of HCFC-22 made. If there is no 
vent treatment to abate emissions, this is a simple procedure. However, where there is abatement then it must be 
shown that this actually treats all streams that may be released into the atmosphere, including direct gas vents 
and the outgassing of aqueous streams. The latter, especially, may not be passed to the destruction facility. If all 
potential vent streams are not treated, the method cannot be used.

if the emissions are included in the quantity calculated by the methods in Chapter 7 of this volume.  
The total quantity of HFC-23 released into the atmosphere is the sum of the quantities from the individual 
release periods and individual reaction systems. HFC-23 that is recovered for use as chemical feedstock should 
be subtracted from the total quantity estimated here. 
In summary, the Tier 1 method is relatively simple, involving the application of a default emission factor to the 
quantity of HCFC-22 produced. This method can be applied at the plant level or the national level. Tier 2 and 
Tier 3 methodologies are suitable only for plant level calculations. In cases where there are Tier 3 data available 
for some plants, the Tier 1 or Tier 2 methods can be applied to the remainder to ensure complete coverage. 
Uncertainty in the national emission is then calculated using production weighted uncertainties of the individual 
sources and standard statistical techniques. Regardless of the method, emissions abated should be subtracted 
from the gross estimate from each plant to determine net emissions before these are added together in the 
national estimate.

It is good practice to use the Tier 3 method if possible. Direct measurement is significantly more accurate than 
Tier 1 because it reflects the conditions specific to each manufacturing facility. In most cases, the data necessary 
to prepare Tier 3 estimates should be available because facilities operating to good business practice perform 
regular or periodic sampling of the final process vent or within the process itself as part of routine operations. 
For facilities using abatement techniques such as HFC-23 destruction, verification of the abatement efficiency is 
also done routinely. The Tier 1 (default) method should be used only in rare cases where plant-specific data are

unavailable and this subcategory is not identified as significant subcategory under key category. (See Section 4.2 
of Volume 1.) 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
There are several measurement options within the Tier 3 method relating to the location and frequency of the 
sampling. In general, direct measurement of the emissions of HFC-23 may provide the highest accuracy but 
continuous or frequent measurement of parameters within the production process area itself may be more 
pragmatic and can be equally accurate. In both cases, the frequency of measurement must be high enough to 
represent the variability in the process (e.g., across the life of the catalyst). Issues related to measurement 
frequency are summarised in Box 3.14, Plant Measurement Frequency. General advice on sampling and 
representativeness is provided in Volume 1, Chapter 2. 
In cases where plant-specific measurements or sampling are not available and Tier 1 methods are used, the 
default emission factor should be used, assuming no abatement methods. For plants in operation prior to 1995 
the default emission factor is 0.04 kg HFC-23/kg HCFC-22 (4 percent) (IPCC, 1996; US EPA, 2001; McCulloch, 
2007). This is a default to be used when there are no measurements and describes the output of HFC-23 from a 
typical HCFC-22 plant in the absence of recovery or destruction of HFC-23. The value is consistent with 
atmospheric observations of HFC-23 concentrations in the 1978-1995 time period (Oram et al.,1998). These 
showed globally averaged emissions to be equivalent to 2 percent of the total quantity of HCFC-22 produced at a 
time when significant HFC-23 was being recovered and converted into Halon 1301 (McCulloch, 1992) and 
abatement was required practice in several countries where there was significant production. 
It is possible, by process optimisation, to reduce the production to between 0.015 and 0.03 kg HFC-23/kg 
HCFC-22 (1.5 to 3 percent) but it is not possible to completely eliminate HFC-23 formation this way 
(McCulloch, 2007). Furthermore, the extent of the reduction is highly dependent on the process design and the 
economic environment (measures to reduce HFC-23 can often reduce the process output). In an optimised 
process HFC-23 production and emissions will, invariably, have been measured; it is not possible to optimise 
process operation without such measurements and so default values have no meaning in this context for an 
individual plant.  The state of the technological art has been advanced by optimisation of individual plants and 
that art should have been built into the design of recent plants, suggesting a default emission factor of 0.03 kg 
HFC-23/kg HCFC-22 (3 percent). These default values have a large uncertainty (in the region of 50 percent). For 
more accurate assessments, the actual emissions should be determined by Tier 2 or Tier 3 methodology and, if 
necessary, assigned to previous years using the guidance provided in Chapter 7 of this volume. Should the vent 
gas be collected for treatment, thermal oxidation has been shown to reduce HFC-23 emission by 99.996 percent 
(Irving, 2000).

BOX 3.14  
PLANT MEASUREMENT FREQUENCY 
The accuracy and precision of the estimates of annual HFC-23 emissions depend on the number of 
samples (the frequency of sample collection) together with the accuracy of measurement of 
flowrates and the extent to which discrete flow measurements can represent the total quantity 
vented. Since production processes are not completely static, the greater the process variability, the 
more frequently plants need to measure. As a general rule, sampling and analysis should be 
repeated whenever a plant makes any significant process changes. Before choosing a sampling 
frequency, the plant should set a goal for accuracy and use statistical tools to determine the sample 
size necessary to achieve the goal. For example, a study of HCFC-22 producers indicates that 
sampling once per day is sufficient to achieve an extremely accurate annual estimate. This 
accuracy goal should then be revised, if necessary, to take into account the available resources.  
(RTI, Cadmus, 1998) 
 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
When using the Tier 1 method, production data should be obtained directly from producers. There are several 
ways producers may determine their production levels, including shipment weights and measuring volume-
times-density, using flow meters. These data should account for all HCFC-22 production for the year, whether 
for sale or for use internally as feedstock, and the plant should describe how the HCFC-22 production rate is 
determined. In some circumstances, producers may consider plant production data to be confidential. For 
national-level activity data, submission of HCFC-22 production data is already required under the Montreal 
Protocol. 
COMPLETENESS 
It should be possible to obtain complete sampling data because there are only a small number of HCFC-22 plants 
in each country, and it is standard practice for each plant operator to monitor process efficiencies and hence 
HFC-23 losses, leading to the adoption of Tier 2 methodology. The destruction efficiencies of thermal oxidisers 
used to abate HFC-23 are generally high (>99 percent) but it is important to establish the composition of the exit 
gas in order to ensure that account is taken of emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases from this point.  
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Emission of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 production should be estimated using the same method for the entire time 
series and appropriate emission factors. If data for any years in the time series are unavailable for the Tier 3 
method, these gaps should be filled according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.10.1.3 UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
TIER 1 
Unlike the other Tiers, where uncertainties are based on measurements and statistics, Tier 1 uncertainties are 
assessed through expert judgement and an error of approximately 50 percent could be considered for Tier 1 
based upon knowledge of the variability in emissions from different manufacturing facilities. An error of this 
magnitude will completely outweigh the uncertainty in the activity. 
TIER 2 
Uncertainty of the Tier 2 result is calculated by the root-squared sum of the individual uncertainties in 
production mass quantity and efficiencies, assuming the carbon and fluorine uncertainties are the same. Where 
the uncertainties in carbon and fluorine efficiency differ significantly (enough to cause a material difference to 
the calculated emission), the value with the lower uncertainty should be used throughout the calculation. 
Uncertainty in the value derived by Tier 2 methods is much larger than that expected from Tier 3 but is, 
nevertheless, quantifiable. Typically, for a plant producing about 4 percent HFC-23, the carbon efficiency is in 
the region of 95 percent and the fluorine efficiency 92 percent. If these efficiencies can be measured to within 1 
percent, then the error in the Tier 2 HFC-23 estimate would be less than 20 percent. Estimating efficiencies to 
this degree of accuracy will require rigorous accounting procedures and that all raw materials and product for 
sale should be weighed in or out of the facility. Such a regime sets the expected accuracy of the overall activity 
(for both Tiers 1 and 2); with good accounting and measurement of production by weight, it should be possible 
to reduce the error in the activity to below 1 percent. 
 Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
      3.21 
 
TIER 3 
For HFC-23, the Tier 3 method is significantly more accurate than either the Tier 2 measured or Tier 1 default 
methods.  Regular Tier 3 sampling of the vent stream can achieve an accuracy of 1-2 percent at a 95 percent 
confidence level in HFC-23 emissions and the uncertainty of the Tier 3 (emission-factor-based) result may be 
similar. In both cases, the uncertainty may be calculated statistically from the uncertainties of the input 
parameters and, because these methods do not rely on emission factors or activities, the concept of subdividing 
uncertainty has no validity.  
Uncertainty of the estimate is expressed as a coefficient of variance (percent) and, for each of these streams, 
there will be an uncertainty as a consequence of uncertainties in measured concentration and flowrate and 
uncertainty in the duration of the flow. The combined uncertainty can be determined analytically and should be 
calculated using the standard methodology described in Chapter 3 of Volume 1.

3.10.2 Emissions from production of fluorinated compounds 
(other than HFC-23 emissions from HCFC-22 
production)  
3.10.2.1 INTRODUCTION 
The emission of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 manufacture was considered in Section 3.10.1.  Section 3.10.2 (this 
section) considers emissions from other fluorochemical production processes. These emissions include emissions 
of the intentionally manufactured chemical as well as reactant and by-product emissions.  For example, in a 
national inventory for a fluorochemical plant, significant by-product emissions of SF6, CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F10, 
C5F12 and C6F14 were reported (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 2005). 
Other examples include the release of by-product N2O and CF4 from the production of NF3 (Tasaka, 2004; 2007), 
CF4 from the production of CFC-11 and 12, or of SF6 from the production of uranium hexafluoride in the nuclear 
fuel cycle.  
Typically, fluorochemicals may be released from chemical processes involving a broad range of technologies 
and processes2: 
• 
Telomerization Process used in the production of fluorochemicals fluids and polymers; 
• 
Photooxidation of tetrafluoroethylene to make fluorochemical fluids; 
• 
Direct Fluorination often used in SF6 production; 
• 
Halogen Exchange Processes to make HFCs 134a and 245fa and low-boiling-point PFCs like C2F6 and CF4;  
• 
NF3 manufacturing by direct fluorination; 
• 
Production of uranium hexafluoride; 
• 
Production of fluorinated monomers like tetrafluoroethylene and hexafluoropropylene; 
• 
Production of fluorochemical agrochemicals; 
• 
Production of fluorochemical anesthetics; 
• 
Production of perfluorpolyethers; 
• 
Production of hydrofluoroolefins (HFO) such as tetrafluoropropene and its precursors.

Halogen exchange processes are extensively used for HFC manufacture, while most PFCs and SF6 require 
elemental fluorine, generated electrochemically. In ‘electrochemical fluorination’ processes, the fluorine is not 
separated but makes the desired product in the electrochemical cell. In other processes it is separated and 
subsequently used, either as the elemental gas or as a component of a carrier system, such as CoF3. Each process 
will have a different spectrum of emissions, in terms of both chemical nature and quantities, and so a common 
default emission function is subject to considerable uncertainty.  
Potential sources of fluorinated GHG emissions at fluorochemical production facilities include the following:  
process vents, equipment leaks, and evacuating returned containers. Production-related emissions of fluorinated 
GHGs occur from both process vents and equipment leaks.  Process vent emissions occur from manufacturing 
equipment such as reactors, distillation columns, and packaging equipment.  Equipment leak emissions, or 
fugitive emissions, occur from valves, flanges, pump seals, compressor seals, pressure relief valves, connectors, 
open-ended lines, and sampling connections. In addition, users of fluorinated GHGs may return empty containers 
(e.g., cylinders) to the production facility for reuse; prior to reuse, the residual fluorinated GHGs (often termed 
“heels”) may be evacuated from the container and are a potential emission source. In many cases, these "heels" 
are contaminated and are exhausted to a treatment device for destruction. In other cases, however, they are 
released into the atmosphere. The Tier 1 default emission factor is intended to cover emissions for process vents, 
equipment leaks, and container venting. 
It is essential that the existence of potentially emissive plants is identified within each country; hence this step is 
first in the decision tree (Figure 3.17). The common factor for most of these plants is the use of anhydrous 
hydrogen fluoride, which is the source of fluorine in halogen exchange processes and in processes that use 
elemental fluorine. The production and importation of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride can therefore be used as a 
means of tracing significant producers of fluorochemicals. Note that in some cases, the plant consuming the 
anhydrous hydrogen fluoride may be supplying fluorinated feedstocks to other plants that themselves produce 
fluorochemicals and emit GHGs.  Further enquiries (see Figure 3.17) can elucidate whether or not there are 
significant fluorochemical greenhouse gas emissions at the plant consuming the anhydrous hydrogen fluoride 
and whether or not that plant supplies fluorinated feedstocks to other plants. 
Feedstocks commonly used in the production of fluoropolymers are HCFC-22, 1,1 difluoroethlyene, 
tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), and hexafluoropropylene oxide (HFPO). Their production and imports can therefore 
be used to identify significant producers of fluoropolymers that may not themselves be consumers of hydrogen 
fluoride. 
In this section, emissions associated with use are not addressed specifically, being counted in the emissions 
related to consumption (see Chapters 4.5, 6, 7 and 8 in this volume). 
3.10.2.2 METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
It is good practice to choose the method using the decision tree shown in Figure 3.17. If the Category 2B9 
Fluorochemical Production is identified as key and this subcategory is judged to be significant, inventory 
compilers should consider whether or not emissions are dominated by the production of a sub-set of chemicals, 
and focus more sophisticated data collection efforts on production of these chemicals. We estimate that 80 
fluorochemical production facilities operate among 20 countries world-wide (2004 SRI report; U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)).  A survey of national 
producers should not be difficult to compile.   
Tier 1 
In the Tier 1 methodology, a default emission factor, or a similar number derived for the particular country's 
circumstances, can be used to estimate national production-related emissions of individual HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and 
other fluorinated greenhouse gases.  The default emission factors in Table 3.28a are expressed in terms of kg 
emitted/kg produced). When used in a Tier 1 calculation, the applicable default emission factor is multiplied by 
the total mass of fluorinated chemical produced.

The fluorinated greenhouse gas k could be the intended gas being manufactured, an un-intended by-product 
formed during manufacturing, or a reactant feed.  Problems of confidentiality arising from reporting specific 
component data can be circumvented by providing a single number for total national emissions of each HFC, 
PFC, SF6 or other fluorinated GHG. This may be facilitated if data are collected by a third party and reported 
only as this total. 
Tier 2 
A mass balance based approach that is based on process efficiencies can be more complicated than for HFC-23 
emissions from HCFC-22 plants as there can be a range of by-products responsible for process inefficiency 
(unlike the case for HCFC-22 where one by-product predominates), as well as loss of the intended product and 
reactants. However, production efficiency data should exist for each process and, in the absence of a more 
rigorous estimate, the emissions can be estimated based on the difference between the total mass of the reactants 
and that of the products. These emissions can then be characterized based on information regarding the chemical 
composition of the emitted mass.  The chemical composition may be determined based on measurements, 
engineering calculations and assessments, process knowledge, etc. Such an estimate may enable a qualitative 
decision as to whether or not these emissions are a significant subcategory under a key category. Should 
sufficient measurements of the chemical composition of the emissions exist, this methodology could also be used 
for estimating emissions for reporting.  
The mass balance method is summarized in Equation 3.41a below. If the chemical composition of the mass of 
material emitted from the process is determined through chemical analysis (e.g., a sample taken from the 
laboratory-, pilot-, or full-scale process) the Tier 2 estimate is further improved.

The mass balance method accounts for both vented and leaked emissions, but not emissions from the venting of 
returned cylinders.  In the case of cylinder venting, emissions can be estimated based on the mass of material 
vented from the cylinder and the chemical composition of the mass.   
Tier 3 
The Tier 3 methodology is potentially the most accurate estimate and is the sum of factory specific emissions of 
each fluorinated greenhouse gas (reactants, intended product, and by-products) determined using standard 
methods to estimate the composition and flowrate of gas streams actually vented to atmosphere after any 
abatement technology. Selected examples of standard methods are Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
(FTIR), gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and calibrated mass flow meters.  The particular 
standard method used for measurement is chosen based on the type of manufacturing process being monitored.  
As noted above, emissions from manufacturing can be divided into two categories: process vents and equipment

Process vent and equipment leaks are described as follows. 
Process Vents 
Process vents are typically configured for intermittent or continuous measurement(s) of the concentration, and 
where a process-vent flow rate exists, emissions can be determined as follows:

Alternatively, process vent emissions can be determined by utilizing a facility- or process-specific emission 
factor.  The emission factor is determined by normalizing the emission rate of the reactants, intended product, 
and by-products by a more easily (or accurately) measurable parameter, such as feedstock flow rate, as described 
in Equation 3.38 in Section 3.10.1:

For process vents, emissions may be determined based on direct measurements, engineering calculations and 
assessments, and process knowledge. For continuous processes with significant fluorinated GHG emissions, it is 
good practice to develop site-specific or even process-vent-specific emission factors based on measurements of 
emissions and activity.  For smaller processes and for batch processes, it is good practice to develop the specific 
emission factors based on either measurements or engineering calculations and assessments. Note that, generally, 
flows are measured volumetrically and should be converted into mass flow (kg/hour) based on the ideal gas law, 
temperature, pressure and composition; similarly concentration should be converted into compatible units (e.g., 
kg/kg).   
 Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions

      3.25 
 
In this case, the flowrates, concentrations and duration should be calculated separately for the periods when the 
abatement technology is or is not operating and only those that lead to actual emissions should be summed and 
reported. 
Cylinder Venting 
In the case of cylinder venting, the Tier 3 approach uses the mass of material vented from the cylinder and the 
chemical composition of the mass as the basis for the emissions estimate. The chemical composition is typically 
available from the contents of the cylinder (e.g., stated purity or certificate of analysis). If there is a question 
regarding the composition of the cylinder contents (e.g., anticipate that impurities are present), then the Tier 3 
approach may include actual measurement of the chemical composition of the vented material using an 
analytical method specified previously in this section. 
Equipment Leaks  
Emissions from equipment leaks can originate from a variety of process and equipment types; there are a number 
of different standard methods from which to choose.  Three example approaches follow and are based on 
guidance from US EPA (1995): the Screening Ranges Approach, Correlation Approach, and Unit-Specific 
Correlation Approach.  While these approaches were developed for hydrocarbons primarily, similar equipment is 
used for fluorochemical production, transfer, and storage and they are therefore appropriate for fluorochemicals.  
The choice of equipment component used is mostly based on the physical state of the chemical (gas, liquid) and 
the temperature and pressure of the process stream.  For a given set of physical parameters, differences in the 
chemical properties between hydrocarbon and fluorochemicals are not expected to significantly affect the leak 
rate from valves, flanges, seals, etc. (See section 2.4.1, 2.4.6, and 2.4.7 in EPA, 1995 for additional information 
on speciating emissions.)  It is, however, important to use appropriate monitoring equipment capable of 
measuring fluorinated chemicals.  For all three approaches, fluorochemicals typically have dramatically different 
response factors than hydrocarbons, and in some cases, have little response on analytical equipment commonly 
used for hydrocarbon leak detection.    
In the Screening Ranges Approach, two sets of emission factors are combined with corresponding equipment 
counts to estimate emissions.  Emission factors are assigned to pieces of equipment (sources) based on whether a 
leak detector applied to the source indicates fluorinated GHG concentrations fall above (source greater than, or 
SG) or below (source less than, or SL) a particular leak concentration definition. These definitions are available 
from US EPA (1995) for many types of equipment (these US EPA values are for total organic compounds but 
may be applied to fluorinated GHG).

an indication of above or below 10,000 ppmv), with the Correlation Approach is an additional refinement to the 
Screening Ranges approach. The Correlation Approach utilizes correlations developed by the US EPA (1995) to

It is important to ensure the units of the correlation and screening values (SV) are consistent with each other.  In 
the case that the SV value is zero, or the value is higher than the upper limit able to be measured by the portable 
screening device, default ELj values in units of kg/hr per equipment type exist.   
 
The third approach for estimating equipment leak emissions is the Unit-Specific Correlation Approach. In the 
Unit-Specific Correlation Approach, selected mass emission rates are determined by an equipment bagging 
procedure, and the associated screening value (concentration) is concurrently measured.  This set of data is used 
to develop a unit-specific correlation (i.e., regression equation) between the log base 10 value of the leak/mass 
rate and screening value for a specific equipment type on a given process unit, as described in Equation 3.43c.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1  
Tier 1 relies on default emission factors.  The default emission factors presented in Table 3.28a are based on a 
survey of the available literature and, in the case of the last factor, on an analysis of data reported to the US EPA 
Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The first two sets of factors apply to production of SF6 and NF3 
respectively; the last applies to production of any other fluorochemical. All of the default emission factors 
assume there is no use of abatement and the default emission factors for SF6, NF3, and “other fluorochemicals” 
include emissions from both process vents and equipment leaks (see Annex 3A.1).   
The lower emission factor provided for SF6 was based on estimated typical emission rates during production; the 
higher emission factor was found for facilities that also vented residual gas (the “heel”) from containers before 
refilling them (because their customers, electronics manufacturers, required highly purified SF6 gas). In countries 
with SF6 production, it is good practice to apply the lower emission factor if container heels are known to be 
recycled or destroyed; otherwise, it is good practice to apply the higher emission factor. 
Both the GHGs emitted and the emission rates for those GHGs (kg per kg of the fluorochemical produced) are 
shown in the middle column of the table.  There is a wide range of substances that may potentially be released 
during production of fluorochemicals. In some cases, the fluorinated GHGs released during production of a 
particular fluorochemical have GWPs similar to that of the produced fluorochemical (AFEAS 2004). However, 
in other cases, the GWPs of the released fluorinated GHGs can be significantly different from that of the 
produced fluorochemical. The default emission factors presented in Table 3.28a, along with the default 
composition of emitted fluorinated GHGs in Table 3.28b, reflect both of these situations.  
The Tier 1 factors are highly uncertain. Therefore, if emission factors specific to the facility and produced 
fluorochemical are available, these should be used. Because emission rates vary widely among facilities and 
processes, caution should be used when applying emission factors measured for a particular fluorochemical at a 
particular facility to the same fluorochemical at a different facility. However, emission factors measured at other 
facilities for the same fluorochemical may be used when the process type (see section 3.10.2.1) used to produce 
the fluorochemical is the same at both facilities, when the treatment of container heels is the same at both 
facilities, and when the emission factor does not reflect abatement. (Emission factors that reflect abatement 
should not be used in the Tier 1 method.) Note that an emission factor measured for production of one 
fluorochemical is not applicable to the production of another, even at the same facility, because different 
fluorochemicals (even if they are chemically similar, such as two HFCs) are associated with different by-
products and different by-product generation rates. Thus, not only the identities, but also the quantities of the 
GHGs emitted differ.  
Some process-specific emission factor data are available from commercially available life cycle assessment 
software; these emission factors may be used if their source data, calculation methods, and units of measure are 
well documented.

e As described further in Annex 3A.1 of this Volume, the default emission factor was estimated using data from the US EPA Greenhouse Gas 
Reporting Program (US EPA, 2017a; 2017b).  Briefly, under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, fluorinated GHG emissions are 
reported annually on a facility basis and include facilities with and without abatement.  Depending on the year, 14 to 16 fluorochemical 
production facilities have reported under the Program. Facilities that abate their emissions report their level of abatement for each process as 
a range. To develop emission factors on an uncontrolled basis, the pre-abatement emissions of each facility were estimated using the 
arithmetic averages of the abatement ranges reported by that facility for its processes. Then, for each facility, this estimate was divided by the 
total quantity of fluorinated gases produced or transformed by that facility to obtain an uncontrolled emission factor for that facility and year.  
This was done for all six years for which the US EPA had data at the time the factor was developed. For each facility, the emission factors 
for each year were then averaged over the six years of reporting, and the resulting facility averages were averaged to obtain the default factor 
above. Because the reporting U.S. facilities use multiple manufacturing methods to produce a wide array of fluorochemicals,3 averaging the 
facility-specific emission factors is expected to provide a default emission factor that is applicable where the manufacturing method is 
unknown, as is often the case in a Tier 1 calculation. 
f As noted above, emission rates from different manufacturing methods can vary widely, a pattern seen in the variation of the emission 
factors across the facilities reporting to the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. This variation (summarized here as a 95-percent 
confidence interval around the arithmetic mean) provides a first order estimate of the uncertainty of the default Tier 1 emission factor.  Thus, 
the default emission factor is broadly applicable, but it is also highly uncertain due to the inherent variability of emission rates across 
manufacturing methods and produced fluorochemicals. 
  
In addition to the compounds being intentionally produced, a variety of fluorinated GHG by-products can be 
emitted from fluorochemical manufacturing processes.  Emissions of these other fluorinated GHGs can exceed 
emissions of the compound being intentionally produced. Where the specific fluorinated GHGs emitted are 
known, inventory compilers should assume that the mass emitted consists of these compounds. Where the 
specific fluorinated GHGs emitted are not known, it is good practice to assume that the mass emitted consists of 
the fluorinated GHGs listed in Table 3.28b in the proportions provided.

a To derive this composition, six years of US EPA GHGRP data were sorted, and the chemical species with the highest estimated 
uncontrolled emissions (in metric tonne) were identified. The weighted average GWP of these emissions is the same as the weighted average 
GWP of the uncontrolled emissions (other than very low-GWP emissions) estimated for fluorinated gas producers that report to the US 
EPA.4  More discussion on the development of the default emissions factor and the representative chemical composition is provided in 
Annex 3A.1.  
 
Tier 2 and Tier 3 
Tier 2 relies on an estimate of the mass of emissions lost from the process, and if available, measurement(s) of 
the chemical composition of the emitted mass. Tier 3 relies on direct measurements of, and the use of, process- 
and facility-specific emission factors to determine the quantities of individual fluorinated GHGs released into the 
atmosphere.  
For Tier 2 and Tier 3, it is important to determine and document whether the production facility abates 
production-related emissions of each fluorinated GHG. If the quantity of gas emitted to the atmosphere is 
reduced by, for example, thermal treatment of the vent stream, the quantity emitted should be adjusted to account 
for the destruction efficiency of the oxidiser and the length of time that it is in service.  As an example, when a 
thermal treatment unit is well-operated and well-maintained, it has been shown to reduce HFC-23 emission by 
99.996 percent (Irving, 2000). However, the on-line time of the destruction process can also have a significant 
effect on emissions and should be recorded. For example, in the case of a treatment system with 99 percent 
removal efficiency, the magnitude of fluorinated GHG emissions would be dominated by the amount of time the 
gas stream is being treated. 
Emission control technologies are used at many facilities to control fluorinated GHG emissions from process 
vents.  Destruction and removal efficiencies (DREs) are generally based on performance testing of emission 
control devices. Results are expected to vary across process equipment and gas flow rates. To apply a DRE to an 
emission control device, the device must be specifically designed to abate fluorochemicals. If facilities use other 
types of abatement devices not designed specifically for fluorinated GHGs, they should assume that its 
destruction efficiency is 0 percent for fluorinated GHGs.  In addition, the inventory compiler must demonstrate 
through communication with facility managers and subsequent documentation that emissions control 
technologies are operated and maintained in accordance with manufacturer specifications. The DRE should only 
apply to that portion of emissions that pass through a properly operating and maintained control device, and 
DRE should not be applied when control device is bypassed, not operating according to manufacturer 
specifications, or not maintained in accordance with specifications. 
 
4 To develop both the mass emission factor in Table 3.28a and the break-out of fluorinated GHGs in Table 3.28b, fluorinated 
GHGs with GWPs above one were included in the analysis. Fluorinated GHGs with GWPs near one, such as unsaturated 
HFCs and PFCs, were excluded. This reduced the emission factor in terms of tons emitted/tons produced, but it had 
negligible impact on the metric tonne of CO2eq. emitted/metric tonne produced.

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
For Tier 1, the activity is the annual mass of the desired fluorochemical that is produced.  These activity data 
may be available as total production data for the country or may be available for individual facilities.  For Tier 2, 
the activity is the mass of the produced fluorochemical(s) as well as the consumption of feedstocks. For Tier 3, 
the activity data for emissions from process vents may be either the annual mass of the produced 
fluorochemical(s) or the annual mass or quantities of one or more feedstocks consumed, and the activity data for 
emissions from equipment leaks is the number of potentially leaking equipment components of each type.  
Individual facilities should have access to the activity data for Tier 2 and Tier 3.  For Tier 3, the activity data 
may sometimes be available from an industry trade group.  
Recycling 
Recycling of used gas may be done by the producers of new gas or by other recycling firms. Emissions may 
occur during handling and purification of old gas and handling of recycled gas. Specific emission factors are not 
available. Thus, good practice is to use the same default factor as for new production. 
COMPLETENESS  
Completeness requires that the national GHG inventory include all GHG emissions from all fluorochemical 
production processes (including emissions from both process vents and equipment leaks) and any other emission 
sources (including container venting) at all facilities in the country. It is important to note that significant GHG 
emissions occur not only from processes and facilities producing fluorinated GHGs (for example, HFCs, PFCs, 
SF6, NF3, and fluoroethers), but also from processes and facilities producing fluoropolymers, which are often 
produced using HCFC, HFC, PFC, and other fluorochemical feedstocks. For some inventory compilers, 
identifying smaller producers and, in particular, recycling firms may be a difficult task. However, initial 
estimates based on the national mass balance of these fluorinated greenhouse gases should identify if production 
related emissions from such entities provide a sizeable contribution to total national emissions. 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Both by-product and fugitive emissions of fluorocompounds from production processes should be estimated 
using the same method for the entire time series and appropriate emission factors. If data for any years in the 
time series are unavailable for the Tier 3 method, these gaps should be filled according to the guidance provided 
in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.10.2.3 UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Uncertainty related to use of the Tier 1 default emission factors includes the uncertainty in the activity data and 
the assumptions made in estimating the destruction efficiency used in the uncontrolled emissions analysis.  For 
Tier 1, the uncertainty in activity data needs to be determined for the reporting country and statistically 
combined with the uncertainty in the default emission factor. Typically, in a well operated facility, the default 
uncertainty in activity data should be in the region of 1 percent, assuming that rigorous accounting records are 
maintained and that production is monitored by weight. There are numerous sources of uncertainty in the default 
Tier 1 emission factor. One is the uncertainty associated with the fact that true uncontrolled emission rates 
naturally vary from facility to facility depending on the fluorochemicals produced and the processes used to 
make them. This variability appears in the US EPA data as differences in the calculated uncontrolled emission 
factors across facilities, differences that persist over the entire time series. The year-to-year variability seen in 
the calculated uncontrolled emission factor for any one facility is generally much smaller than this facility-to-
facility variability. The uncertainty shown in Table 3.28a for the default EF for any other fluorochemicals 
reflects this variation among facilities. The 95 percent confidence interval (calculated based on the relative 
standard deviation among the facilities’ emission factors) is ±470 percent. Because there cannot be a negative 
emission factor on the low side, a value of 0.001 was selected as the lower uncertainty bound, as it is 
representative of lower emission factor values seen in the data set. This results in an uncertainty range for the 
Tier 1 default emission factor of 0.001 to 0.2. 
Another source of uncertainty for the default EF for any other fluorochemicals is the exact extent to which the 
emissions from individual processes are controlled by the facilities reporting to the US EPA GHGRP. As noted 
above, the level of abatement (destruction efficiency, or DE) is reported as a range rather than a point estimate, 
but a point estimate must be used to back-calculate uncontrolled emissions. Thus, there is uncertainty in the 
choice of this point estimate and in the uncontrolled emissions used to calculate emission factors for each facility 
and year. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding the exact mix of fluorinated GHGs that would be emitted 
from each process without controls. Emissions at the facility level are generally reported by chemical, but 
emissions at the process level are reported by chemical group. While this provides general process-level 
information on the nature and GWP of the emitted GHGs, the GHGs that fall into each group vary in their GWPs.

3.32           
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 
However, both of these sources of uncertainty are mitigated by the large number of data points in the analysis, 
which come from the large number of processes and significant number of years covered. Thus, the errors related 
to the destruction efficiency estimated for each individual process and to the mix of gases emitted tend to 
balance out, and the aggregate uncertainty is reduced. A Monte Carlo analysis indicated that the uncertainty for 
each facility’s uncontrolled emission factor was less than 50 percent.    
For Tier 3 emissions, the uncertainty of the measurements should be determined individually and combined 
(using standard statistical methods) to provide a total uncertainty for the estimate. The methodology is identical 
to that described for HFC-23 from HCFC-22. In the Tier 2 methodology, the uncertainty both of the 
measurements of efficiencies and the assignment of losses to individual compounds should be assessed. Because 
these are liable to produce a much larger uncertainty than that from Tier 3, the utility of Tier 2 is likely to be 
limited to assessing whether or not by-product fluorochemical emissions are a significant subcategory under key 
category.

HYDROGEN PRODUCTION 
Hydrogen (H2) is a gas with flammable properties similar to natural gas and gasoline (Hydrogen Council, 2017). 
The main current uses of hydrogen are as raw material in refineries and in the production of ammonia, methanol 
and other chemicals. Other uses are as an energy carrier in the transport sector, as energy storage and buffer 
systems in renewable electricity production, as a main constituent in coal gas (city gas) used for heating and 
cooking, as well as in semiconductor industry processing and welding. Production of hydrogen may yield 
emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), depending on the production method, while combustion or conversion of 
hydrogen to produce heat and electricity yields zero carbon dioxide emissions. An increase in the production, 
storage and use of hydrogen is expected in the future, due to an increased demand for low-carbon fuels and 
technologies. 
3.11.1 Introduction  
This section describes methodological guidance for estimating emissions from Hydrogen production. The 
methods are primarily applicable to instances where hydrogen is produced as the main product at a stand-alone 
facility. Note that where hydrogen is produced as part of a gas mixture (for instance in the case of syngas 
production – see Box 3.19), or as a by-product or intermediate product within another chemical or petrochemical 
process, then the GHG emissions should be estimated using methods for the most appropriate main product. For 
example, hydrogen is commonly produced as a by-product or intermediate product at petroleum refineries and at 
chemical facilities producing ammonia, methanol, and other products. In these instances, it is good practice for 
inventory compilers to apply the methodological guidance specific to those processes, as provided elsewhere 
within Volume 2 (Energy) and Volume 3 (IPPU), including: 
• 
Volume 2, section 4.2 Fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems (includes guidance for emissions 
from hydrogen production in petroleum refineries, with resultant GHG emissions to be reported under 
1.B.2.a.i); 
• 
Volume 3, section 3.2 Ammonia production (with resultant GHG emissions to be reported under 2.B.1); 
• 
Volume 3, section 3.9 Petrochemical and carbon black production (includes guidance for production of 
methanol and ethylene, both of which may also generate hydrogen by-product, with resultant GHG 
emissions to be reported under the appropriate sub-sector(s) of 2.B.8). 
 
Hydrogen Production Technologies 
Hydrogen can be produced through a wide range of chemical, thermochemical and biological processes; Table 
3.29 below presents an overview of the current status (in terms of scale of production) and associated GHG 
emissions of each known technology. 
The predominant hydrogen production technologies, accounting for more than 95 percent of global hydrogen 
production, are steam reforming and gasification of fossil fuels (Ogden, 1999; Speirs et al., 2017). Steam 
reforming and gasification are thermochemical technologies using feedstock from fossil or renewable sources, 
which is combined with heat and catalysts to trigger chemical reactions for transforming the feedstock (for 
example, natural gas, LPG, naphtha, coal, methanol, biomass and waste) into a gas mixture rich in hydrogen. 
When hydrogen is the final product (see Box 3.15), a series of enhancement and purification steps yields a 
highly pure hydrogen output (99.95 percent purity is typical at present).  
Production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is widespread, mainly in small-scale plants, and accounts for about 
4 percent of current global hydrogen production. Other methods for hydrogen production are currently at a minor 
or experimental level. Several of the production methods, e.g. water electrolysis and photo induced water 
splitting, do not generate direct GHG emissions from the hydrogen production process. Others, e.g. steam 
reforming of ammonia and thermal water splitting, generate no process emissions of GHGs but do emit GHGs 
from stationary combustion of fuels to heat the production process, and accordingly these emissions should be 
reported in the Energy sector. 
Biological methods to generate hydrogen are currently at a very small-scale, and typically involve a fermentation 
process to produce hydrogen, using living microbes such as algae and bacteria. In the production process either 
fossil or biogenic materials are consumed under anaerobic conditions, and the output products are hydrogen gas 
containing minor amounts of CO2, CH4 and other organic substances, and CO2 off-gas which may be partly 
captured by the microbes; at present a maximum of 2 percent CH4 by mass in the hydrogen product  is reported 
in some anaerobic biological methods (Braga et al 2017). Any CH4 and CO2 produced in the process will 
become a constituent part of the fermentation gas product, and any subsequent emissions from this gas use

should be reported in the sector(s) where it is used. Hence, emissions from hydrogen production by biological 
methods are considered negligible and should not be reported in the hydrogen production sector. 
Further development and increased uptake of low-emission hydrogen production methods is anticipated, 
however, methods using fossil feedstock currently dominate due to economic reasons (Speirs et al., 2017).  
Hydrogen Production: GHG Emission Sources and Reporting Allocations 
There are many different hydrogen production technologies, and their contribution to GHG emissions range from 
zero direct emissions at the production facility (e.g. water electrolysis) to significant direct GHG emissions (e.g. 
from steam reforming or gasification of fossil feedstocks). Of the directly emissive technologies, some utilise 
fossil fuels only for combustion, to heat the process, with no chemical process GHG emissions associated with 
the hydrogen production, such as dehydrogenation or thermal water splitting, whilst hydrogen production 
through steam reforming or gasification of fossil materials does result in both chemical process and combustion-
derived GHG emissions. 
Table 3.29 provides information on best practice for the reporting allocation of emissions from each technology, 
and further guidance is as follows: 
(i) 
The GHG emissions from hydrogen production as a pure main product at a stand-alone facility should be 
reported under the Hydrogen production sector in IPPU. This typically includes GHG emissions from 
hydrogen production technologies that generate process emissions from fossil feedstocks, i.e. steam 
reforming or gasification of fossil materials. Hydrogen production methods that generate no direct GHG 
emissions, such as the electrolysis of water, should not be considered in the IPPU sector; 
(ii) It is good practice to report under Hydrogen Production all the GHG emissions from steam reforming and 
gasification of fossil materials, including the fuel combustion and chemical process emissions from the 
fuels and feedstock, and to exclude these fuel combustion emissions from the Energy sector, in line with the 
IPCC methods for other similar chemical processes, such as production of ammonia (2B1) and 
petrochemicals (2B8). 
(iii) Emissions of CO2 from thermochemical processes such as steam reforming and gasification using biomass 
as feedstock should be reported as a memo item only, to avoid double counting with emissions reported in 
source categories in Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU). If the feedstock contains both 
fossil and biogenic components (e.g., auto diesel mixed in with biodiesel, waste, etc.), the CO2 emission 
should be allocated partly to the Hydrogen production sector and partly to the memo item, relative to the 
respective fossil and biogenic carbon shares. 
(iv) As noted above, where hydrogen is produced as a by-product for sale or as an intermediate product in a 
source category provided with methodological guidance on GHG emissions from hydrogen production, it is 
good practice to estimate GHG emissions by applying the methodological guidance for the appropriate 
source category. These source categories include: 
a. 
Petroleum refineries (Volume 2, section 4.2) 
b. 
Ammonia production (Volume 3, section 3.2) 
c. 
Methanol production and ethylene production (Volume 3, section 3.9)  
(v) Where GHG emissions arise from production of intermediate or by-product hydrogen (including gas 
mixtures containing hydrogen) in sectors not provided with a methodology for estimating these emissions, 
it is good practice to use one of the methodological approaches provided in Volume 3 IPPU (ammonia, 
methanol or hydrogen), as follows:  
a. 
If the feedstock is completely oxidized and the main product does not contain carbon, the 
methodology for hydrogen production should be used.  
b. 
If the feedstock is partly oxidized and the main product does not contain carbon, the methodology 
for ammonia production should be used.  
c. 
If the main product contains carbon, the methodology for methanol production and ethylene 
production should be used. 
The compiler should use the methodology that minimises uncertainties in the national inventory, transparently 
note which method(s) are used, and report the GHG emissions in the appropriate source category of the main 
product for that facility.  
(vi) Where hydrogen is produced as part of a hydrogen carrier, or released from such a hydrogen carrier system, 
the GHG emissions yielded from the process may be allocated to a range of different sectors, according to 
the carrier type. See Box 3.17 for further details. 
 Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
      3.35 
 
(vii) Where activity data for hydrogen production at the national level may combine data from stand-alone 
facilities and integrated facilities within other sectors, and from emissive and non-emissive technologies, 
inventory compilers should take care to ensure that gaps and double counting of emissions do not occur. 
In light of the range of production technologies, it may be difficult for inventory compilers to obtain fully-
resolved activity data by technology, making it difficult to estimate and report GHG emissions consistent with 
the good practice methods outlined above. 
As for all inventory source categories, it is good practice to estimate and report emissions from hydrogen 
production such that inventory uncertainties are minimised, and to minimise the risk of any gaps or double-
counts in the reported estimates across Energy and IPPU source categories. In the event that the good practice 
approach to reporting hydrogen production cannot be achieved due to national circumstances, then inventory 
compilers should transparently document the methods applied, note where emissions from hydrogen production 
are included (fully or in part) within Energy and/or other IPPU source categories, and derive uncertainty 
estimates that reflect the country-specific approach. 
See Box 3.16 for details about double counting. 
Reporting of GHGs contained within the hydrogen product  
Some hydrogen production methods generate GHGs as an unintended constituent of the product. For instance, 
hydrogen produced by biological processes may contain minor amounts of methane. In these cases, the GHGs 
are emitted after the product has been sold to an end user, either from the use or fugitive release of the product 
itself or from the combustion of it. It is good practice to estimate GHG emissions using methods specific to the 
final emission source, and report the emissions in that sector, and not in the Hydrogen production sector.  
Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage 
Should CO2 capture technology be installed and used at a plant where hydrogen is produced from steam 
reforming or gasification of fossil materials, it is good practice to deduct the CO2 captured in a higher tier 
emissions calculation. The default assumption is that there is no CO2 capture and storage (CCS). In most cases, 
methodologies that account for CO2 capture should consider that CO2 emissions captured in the process may be 
both combustion and process-related. However, in the case of hydrogen production from steam reforming or 
gasification of fossil materials, no distinction is made between fuel and feedstock emissions with all emissions 
accounted for in the IPPU Sector. Similarly, all CO2 captured should be accounted for in the IPPU Sector. For 
additional information on CO2 capture and storage, refer to Volume 3, Section 1.2.2 and for more details on 
capture and storage to Volume 2, Section 2.3.4. 
CH4 and N2O emissions from hydrogen production 
Steam reforming and gasification produce very minor emissions of CH4 and N2O, in addition to CO2 emissions. 
The available literature indicates that emissions of CH4 and N2O are very low, activity data for the process 
combustion source are likely to be hard to obtain, and the literature evidence is insufficient to establish an 
estimation method. Hence, no reporting of CH4 and N2O is required in this sector.

DEFINITIONS  
Pure hydrogen and gas mixtures 
Pure hydrogen is hydrogen gas that has been purified to meet industry product quality standards. 
Pure hydrogen is produced by complete oxidation of feedstocks or by other technologies (Table 
3.29). 
Hydrogen that is produced by technologies that partially oxidize a hydrocarbon feedstock will also 
contain other gases (typically CH4, CO, CO2, other hydrocarbons) and is defined as a "gas 
mixture".   
Final products and intermediate products  
A final product is an intended output product from a production facility. The final product can be 
either sold as a commercial product or exported offsite for use in another facility. An intermediate 
product is an output from one production process, which is consumed as raw material or fuel in a 
later production step at the same facility.   
Main products and by-products  
A main product is the product defining a facility’s sector in the IPCC reporting. As a rule of 
thumb, the main product is the product generating the highest monetary production value. By-
products are all other products made intentionally at the facility. If nothing else is stated, main 
products and by-products are final products. 
Feedstock, raw material and fuel 
In this section, feedstock means the total input material in a manufacturing process. Raw material 
is the part of the feedstock being transformed into the final or intermediate product(s). Fuel is a 
material combusted to produce heat. The fuel might be derived from the feedstock (i.e. internal 
energy source) or provided separately (i.e. external energy source).

CURRENT HYDROGEN PRODUCTION METHODS – STATUS OF DEVELOPMENT AND ALLOCATION OF 
EMISSIONS TO SECTOR 
Notes: 
1 Status of development refers to the current situation in a global scale. Major, moderate and minor reflect the amount of industrial 
hydrogen production. Experimental means that the hydrogen is not yet produced in an industrial scale.  
2 Where hydrogen is produced as a by-product or intermediate product, the emissions are typically already accounted for in the 
emission estimates for the respective sectors derived using methodological guidance in Volume 3 Energy or Volume 4 IPPU. 
Emissions from production of hydrogen as part of mixtures with other gases, e.g., syngas, are not covered by this section. See Box 
3.15 for the definition of main product, by-product and intermediate product and Box 3.16 about double counting. 
3 Non-biogenic emissions are reported to IPPU and biogenic emissions are reported as a memo item (i.e. not included in the IPPU 
totals). 
4 No process emissions, as the feedstock does not contain carbon. All emissions arise from combustion of fuels to power the 
production process. 
5 Only direct emissions (i.e. emissions generated in the production facilities during production) are considered, according to standard 
IPPU methodology. 
6 In dehydrogenation, the raw material is not consumed. Hence, all emissions come from fuel combusted to produce heat for the 
reaction. 
 
BOX 3.16 (NEW) 
DOUBLE COUNTING, COMPLETENESS AND CROSS-CUTTING ALLOCATION 
• In order to avoid double counting, activity data and emissions from production of hydrogen 
reported in the Hydrogen production sector must be excluded from other sectors, i.e. the total 
quantities of oil, gas, coal and other fossil materials (fuel plus feedstock) used in hydrogen 
production must be subtracted from the quantity reported under energy use in the Energy sector. 
Conversely, activity data and emissions from production of hydrogen reported in the Energy 
sector and IPPU sectors other than Hydrogen production must be excluded from the Hydrogen 
production sector.  
• Where the level of activity data resolution does not enable separation of the production of 
hydrogen as a pure product, by-product or gas mixture, then it is good practice for compilers to 
calculate and report emission estimates such that (i) the emission estimates are complete with no 
double-counting, and (ii) that overall inventory uncertainty is minimised. Further, it is good 
practice to clearly explain the national circumstances, activity data, methods and reporting 
allocations in inventory submissions. 
• In many hydrogen production processes, the same fossil material is used both as raw material for 
the production process and as fuel combusted to heat the process. It is impractical to seek to 
distinguish between “fuel” and “feedstock” and to report these emissions separately. Therefore, it 
is good practice to report both the fuel combustion and chemical process emissions in the 
Hydrogen production sector, and to exclude these fuel combustion emissions from the Energy 
sector, consistent with the IPPU cross-cutting guidance as presented in Vol. 3 IPPU, Chapter 1.2.1 
and Box 1.1. 
• To minimise the risk of gaps and double-counts, inventory compilers may need to consult with 
statistical agencies, trade associations and plant operators as appropriate, to seek to ensure that the 
hydrogen production activity data does not include any hydrogen derived from non-emissive 
technologies, nor any production of hydrogen as a by-product or intermediate within facilities that 
produce other main outputs such as refineries, ammonia and methanol plant where the GHG 
emissions are already accounted for elsewhere in the inventory. 
• Recovered CO2 might be delivered for downstream use, for instance as raw material in other 
manufacturing processes or as dry ice (cooling, cleaning, etc.), or sent to a permanent storage. 
When used in a downstream manufacturing sector, the CO2 might be embedded into a product (for 
instance through a chemical reaction) or emitted to the atmosphere. It is good practice to report the 
emission of CO2 from downstream use in the downstream IPPU or other sector, and to subtract 
the recovered CO2 from the Hydrogen production sector.  
• The downstream use and permanent storage of recovered CO2 should be transparently described 
and must be documented in accordance with IPCC Guidelines. It is good practice to cross-check 
that all emissions from downstream use of recovered CO2 is accounted for in the corresponding 
downstream sector(s).

PRODUCTION AND USE OF HYDROGEN CARRIERS  
Hydrogen is a highly volatile gas, which may be transported through a pipeline or in tanks as a 
compressed gas or as a cryogenic liquid. To facilitate the safe, efficient transport and storage of 
hydrogen, a carrier chemical may be used. A ‘hydrogen carrier’ is a chemical substance containing 
hydrogen that is easy to store and transport, from which the hydrogen gas can be extracted through 
a chemical reaction for use in a downstream sector. Some carriers are recycled for subsequent 
hydrogen deliveries, while others are consumed in the process where the hydrogen is released.  
Some hydrogen carriers are produced with a full load of hydrogen in a single-step process. Other 
hydrogen carriers are produced and loaded with hydrogen in a two-step process, first as an 
“empty” carrier. Subsequently, the hydrogen (normally produced at a different plant) is embedded 
into the empty carrier through a chemical reaction.  
The hydrogen carrier is transported to a downstream facility, for example a refuelling station, 
where the hydrogen is released by a chemical reaction (dehydrogenation) and filled into a vehicle 
or machine, or the hydrogen carrier itself is filled into a fuel cell, in which the hydrogen (H2) is 
released and consumed. 
The different types of hydrogen carrier chemicals have the GHG emissions from their production 
and use allocated to different sectors.  
Organic hydrides 
Hydrogen can be reacted with aromatic substances such as benzene and toluene to form liquid 
organic hydrides.  
The emissions from the manufacturing of hydrogen should be allocated to the Hydrogen 
production sector, while the emissions from production of the aromatic substances used as “empty 
carriers” should be allocated to the Petrochemical and carbon black sector.  
The reaction releasing hydrogen at the downstream facility produces no process emissions of 
GHGs. Instead, the organic hydride is converted back to the original aromatic substance and 
transported to the hydrogen production facility to embed more hydrogen, in a circular material 
flow pattern. The hydrogen-releasing reaction requires heat, which might be produced by 
combustion of fossil fuels. In such cases, the emitted CO2 should be allocated to the Energy sector 
(stationary combustion). 
Ammonia 
Ammonia (NH3) is a hydrogen-rich gas that can be cooled down and/or compressed into a liquid 
and transported to a downstream facility or fuel cell. There the hydrogen (H2) may be released by a 
chemical reaction (dehydrogenation).  
The emissions from the ammonia production process should be allocated to the Ammonia 
production sector, even though the purpose of producing the ammonia is to derive hydrogen for 
downstream use.  
For the use of ammonia as hydrogen carrier, no emissions should be allocated to the Hydrogen 
production sector. The reaction releasing hydrogen at a downstream facility produces no process 
emissions of CO2, since the ammonia contains no carbon. Fossil combustion emissions from the 
hydrogen releasing reaction should be allocated to the Energy sector (stationary combustion).  
Methanol 
Methanol (CH3OH) is a hydrogen-rich liquid that can be transported to a downstream facility, 
where the hydrogen may be released by a chemical reaction (e.g. steam reforming).  
The emissions from the methanol production should be allocated to the Petrochemical and carbon 
black production sector, even though the purpose of producing the methanol is to derive hydrogen 
for downstream use.  
The process at the downstream facility to release hydrogen from the methanol generates process 
emissions of CO2. These emissions should be reported in the Hydrogen production sector, using 
the estimation methods provided for this sector.  
Consumption of methanol in direct methanol fuel cells yields CO2 emissions, but hydrogen (H2) 
isn’t involved in the reactions. Accordingly, these CO2 emissions should be reported in the Energy 
sector.

3.11.2 Methodological issues 
The predominant methods for hydrogen production at present are steam reforming and gasification of fossil 
feedstocks. Both technologies oxidise the feedstock during the process itself and also in combustion to heat the 
process, releasing CO2.  
Technologies for producing hydrogen from fossil or biogenic feedstocks in an open, aerobic environment can be 
placed in either of two categories, according to the degree of conversion of the feedstock carbon: complete 
oxidation technologies and partial oxidation technologies.  
Complete oxidation technologies convert all feedstock carbon into CO2 (except for a small residue of solid 
carbon), and they have hydrogen as the main product. The CO2 emissions can be estimated from feedstock 
consumption or hydrogen production data.  
Partial oxidation technologies convert parts of feedstock carbon into CO2, and they result in gas mixtures 
having hydrogen as a constituent. In several industries using hydrogen as a raw material, partial oxidation 
technologies5 are often used to produce an intermediate mixture of hydrogen and CO (e.g. syngas production, 
see Box 3.19), as also CO is needed for raw material. To regulate the H2:CO ratio, hydrogen might be separated 
from the mixture as a by-product and burnt for fuel or used externally (e.g. sold for use in a downstream sector).  
A list of production methods and allocation by sector is given in Table 3.29. 
COMPLETE OXIDATION TECHNOLOGIES 
The main complete oxidation technologies are steam reforming of natural gas and fossil liquids (Figure 3.18) and 
gasification of coal and lignite (Figure 3.19). Both production processes have several steps, in order to maximise 
the hydrogen output. The first one partially oxidizes the feedstock carbon and generates a gas mixture containing 
hydrogen, carbon monoxide and, in the case of gasification of coal and lignite, solid carbon. The next step 
further oxidizes the carbon by a water gas shift reaction, yielding even more hydrogen. An integrated 
combustion reaction using feedstock (or gasified feedstock) as fuel, or in some cases a support fuel, provides 
energy to produce steam for the water gas shift reaction.  
Other feedstocks are sometimes used as well, though in a very small scale at present. The feedstock material may 
be fossil carbon in origin, biogenic carbon in origin, or a mixture of fossil and biogenic (such as the use of mixed 
wastes as a feedstock), but the underlying chemistry to derive the hydrogen is the same and hence the GHG 
emission estimation methods are similar.  
In both the hydrogen producing (overall) reaction and the combustion reaction there is a close to 1:1 molar 
relation between the produced CO2 and the carbon contained in the feedstock. The only exception is a small 
amount of solid carbon residue disposed of as waste.

CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BY COMPLETE OXIDATION TECHNOLOGIES  
Steam reforming of natural gas (overall reactions): 
1a) Reforming: CH4 + 2H2O  →  CO2 + 4H2  
1b) Combustion: CH4 + 2O2  →  CO2 + 2H2O  
 
Steam reforming or gasification of other fossil or biogenic feedstocks (overall general formulas): 
2a) Reforming or gasification: CaHbOc + (2a-c)*H2O  →  a*CO2 + (2a+0.5b-c)*H2   
2b) Combustion: CaHbOc + (a+0.25b-0.5c)*O2  →  a*CO2 + 0.5b*H2O  
  
Gasification of waste (overall general formulas): 
3a) Gasification:  
  CaHbOcNdSe + (2a-c+2d+2e)*H2O  →  a*CO2 + d*NO2 + e*SO2 + (2a+0.5b- c+2d+2e)*H2

  CaHbOcNdSe + (a+0.25b-0.5c+d+e)*O2  →  a*CO2 + d*NO2 + e*SO2 + 0.5b*H2O 
 
In all these overall reactions the ratio of consumed feedstock carbon atoms to produced CO2 
molecules is 1:1. The molar relation between each reforming or gasification reaction and the 
subsequent combustion reaction depends on the efficiency of the production process, and the ratio 
of produced hydrogen to produced CO2 varies accordingly (Braga et al., 2017; Trane et al., 2012). 
 
PARTIAL OXIDATION TECHNOLOGIES 
Partial oxidation technologies are reforming and gasification technologies producing hydrogen and carbon 
monoxide (CO) in closed systems with a sub-stoichiometric supply of oxygen. The process typically includes the 
first reaction step in a complete oxidation technology producing a mixture of hydrogen and CO, and it might 
include one or more subsequent steps (e.g., a water gas shift reaction) to obtain the desired ratios for the two 
gases. Purified gases, including H2, may be produced as a by-product.  
Emissions from technologies partially oxidizing the feedstock, including syngas production (see Box 3.19 
below), are not covered by the estimation methods in this section, to avoid double counting with other sectors.

SYNGAS 
Syngas is a gas mixture containing hydrogen, carbon monoxide and sometimes smaller amounts of 
CO2, methane and other gases as well. The hydrogen to carbon monoxide molar ratio varies from 
about 0.5 to 5 depending on the feedstock. Syngas is produced by different technologies partially 
oxidizing the feedstock, including steam reforming, gasification, partial oxidation and auto-thermal 
reforming, in the presence of heat. The feedstock may be natural gas, coal, liquid refinery residues 
or other carbon containing materials.  
Syngas is typically used as an intermediate product in refineries, ammonia, methanol or other 
chemical industries, but production for offsite use as an energy product or separated into its single 
gases also occurs. Surplus hydrogen might be separated from the syngas and purified into a by-
product to obtain a specific H:CO ratio in the syngas for use in the production process of the main 
product. Emissions from syngas production are not covered by the estimation methods in this 
section. Methods to estimate GHG emissions from syngas intermediate and hydrogen by-product 
production in petroleum refineries, ammonia, methanol and other chemical production are 
provided in the respective Energy and IPPU sectors.

Abbas, 2018; Copeland et al., 2005; Maurstad, 2005; The Global Syngas Technologies Council, 2018; The 
National Energy Technology Laboratory, 2018, 2002.  
 
OTHER PRODUCTION METHODS 
Biological methods including fermentation produce hydrogen by using living microbes like algae and bacteria. 
In the production process either fossil or biogenic raw materials are consumed under anaerobic conditions, and 
the output products are hydrogen containing minor amounts of CO2, methane and other organic substances, and 
CO2 off-gas. Methane and other GHGs being produced along with the hydrogen are parts of the product and 
should be reported in the sector(s) where it is used. The CO2 off-gas is assumed balanced by the CO2 taken up by 
the microbes, and should not be reported. 
Production of hydrogen by other technologies than those mentioned above, including water electrolysis, photo 
induced water splitting, steam reforming of ammonia and thermal water splitting, are typically without process 
GHG emissions, and emissions from these production methods should not be reported in the Hydrogen 
production sector.   
3.11.2.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
The choice of method will depend on the availability of activity data, as shown in the decision tree (Figure 3.20). 
The Tier 1c, 2c and 3c methods are based on feedstock consumption data, while the Tier 1b, 2b and 3b methods 
are based on hydrogen production data. The Tier 1a method is based on hydrogen production data on a total 
national or regional level, or hydrogen production capacity if production data are not available. There is no Tier 
method labelled 2a or 3a on this section. 
If all relevant activity data are available, it is good practice to choose the method having the lowest overall 
uncertainty. A higher Tier method has a lower uncertainty than a lower one, and the Tier c method normally has 
a lower uncertainty than the Tier b method at the same Tier level. The Tier 1a method has the highest uncertainty. 
CO2 released from hydrogen production may be recovered, either for capture and storage or for use in other 
downstream manufacturing industries. In all emission estimation methods, it is good practice to subtract 
recovered CO2 from the estimated emissions in the Hydrogen production sector and to include the emissions in 
the respective downstream IPPU sector(s). If the recovered CO2 is sent to permanent storage, it is good practice 
to subtract the recovered CO2 from the Hydrogen production sector.  
The estimation methods below are presented using energy units (GJ) for feedstock activity data, and mass units 
(tonne) for the hydrogen production data. Where these parameters are reported in different units at the national 
or facility level (e.g. volume, mass) then unit conversions consistent with national or facility data or IPCC 
defaults may be applied. 
Guidance on how to allocate the GHG emissions to the correct sector is given in the previous section (3.11.1). 
TIER 1 METHOD 
The Tier 1 methods use national or regional level activity data together with default factors and data on 
recovered CO2 to derive emissions. This method should be used if country-specific factors (Tier 2) or plant 
 Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions

      3.43 
 
specific activity data and factors (Tier 3) are not available and hydrogen production is not a key category. The 
activity data are consumption of feedstock (Tier 1c) or production of hydrogen (Tier 1b and 1a). In the Tier 1c 
and 1b methods the activity data are split by type of feedstock, and feedstock specific factors in Table 3.30 
should be used. In the Tier 1a method total national or regional activity data and the general default factors in 
Table 3.30 could be used.  
The CO2 emissions are estimated as follows:

RCO2

Aggregate feedstock consumption data (FC) or hydrogen production data (HP) from national statistics may be 
used in the Tier 1 methods. For feedstock data obtained in tonne, conversion to GJ can be done by using the 
default calorific values in the Ch. 1. Vol. 2 of 2006 IPCC Guidelines 6. If data on feedstock consumption or 
hydrogen production are not available, hydrogen production capacity data might be combined with a utilization 
factor to estimate the hydrogen production in the Tier 1a method. The selection of activity data should aim to 
minimise the risk of any gaps or double-counting (Box 3.16) with hydrogen production from non-emissive 
technologies, or from partial oxidation technologies and fuel combustion already included in other inventory 
estimates.  
The feedstock requirement factor (FRF) converts the production of hydrogen into the corresponding 
consumption of feedstock. The default values are given in Table 3.30. The carbon content factor (CCF) converts 
the feedstock into carbon equivalents, while 44/12 converts the carbon into CO2. 
It is good practice to estimate of the fossil and biogenic emissions separately, based on the respective fossil and 
biogenic carbon shares, and to allocate the biogenic emissions to a memo item and exclude it from the Hydrogen 
production sector. If the biogenic part cannot be estimated, it is good practice to assume that all feedstock is 
fossil. If no data on recovered CO2 could be obtained, it is good practice to assume that the recovery is zero. 
If activity data and factors for all the Tier 1 methods are available, it is good practice to use the method giving 
the lowest uncertainty.

TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 methods use national or regional level activity data together with country-specific factors and data on 
recovered CO2 to derive emissions, and should be used when hydrogen production is a key category and plant-
specific activity data are not available. The activity data used in the Tier 2 method must be split by type of 
feedstock. The CO2 emissions are estimated as follows:

FRFj  = feedstock requirement per unit of output, feedstock j, GJ feedstock / tonne hydrogen produced 
CCFj  = carbon content factor, feedstock j, tonne C / GJ feedstock 
RCO2  = CO2 recovered, tonne 
The equations used in the Tier 2 methods are equal to those used in the Tier 1 method labelled the same letter, 
the only difference between the two Tier levels being that country-specific factors are needed at the Tier 2 level. 
Aggregate hydrogen production data (HPj) or feedstock consumption data (FCj) from national statistics may be 
used in the Tier 2 method. If activity data and factors for both Tier 2 methods are available, it is good practice to 
use the method giving the lowest uncertainty. It is good practice to use feedstock requirement factors (FRFj) 
reflecting whether internal or external energy sources are used to heat the process. If no information on internal 
vs. external energy source is available, it is good practice to use FRFjs for internal energy sources and to note 
that the information is missing. Double counting with other sectors should be avoided (Box 3.16).  
The FRFj converts the production of hydrogen into the corresponding consumption of feedstock. The carbon 
content factor (CCFj) converts the feedstock into carbon equivalents, while 44/12 converts the carbon into CO2.  
It is good practice to estimate of the fossil and biogenic emissions separately, and to allocate the biogenic 
emissions to a memo item and exclude it from the Hydrogen production sector. A fuel containing a fossil and a 
biogenic part should be split according to the respective fossil and biogenic carbon shares. If country-specific 
factors and/or an adequate split of the activity data by type of feedstock are not available and Hydrogen 
production is not a key category, it is good practice to use the Tier 1 method.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 methods use process- and plant-level activity data and factors together with data on recovered CO2 
and stored amounts of solid carbon to derive emissions. The CO2 emissions are estimated as follows:

Plant, process and feedstock specific activity data and factors should be obtained from the hydrogen producers. 
Double counting with other sectors should be avoided (Box 3.16). If activity data and factors for both Tier 3 
methods are available, it is good practice to use the method giving the lowest uncertainty.  
The FRFs should take into account whether or not the fuel used to heat the process is derived from the feedstock 
(i.e. internal or external energy source). Emissions from fossil and biogenic fuels should be estimated separately, 
and the biogenic emissions should be allocated to a memo item and excluded from the Hydrogen production 
sector. Fuels containing a fossil and a biogenic part should be split according to the respective fossil and 
biogenic carbon shares. 
Stored solid carbon here refers to solid carbon or coke formed unintentionally during the production process and 
disposed of as waste (i.e., not combusted at the production facility). Where no information on the carbon content 
in the stored solid carbon is available, it is good practice to assume that it is pure carbon. It is good practice to 
exclude stored solid carbon from the estimated emissions in the Hydrogen production sector. In the Hydrogen 
production sector, stored solid carbon does not include recovered CO2 sent to permanent storage. 
If plant, process and feedstock specific activity data and factors are not available and emissions from hydrogen 
production is a key category, it is good practice to use a Tier 2 method. If emissions from hydrogen production is 
not a key category, a Tier 1 method may be used.

3.11.2.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
The feedstock requirement factor (FRF) converts the production of hydrogen into the corresponding 
consumption of feedstock (raw material and fuel). The carbon content factor (CCF) converts the amount of 
feedstock in GJ into tonne of carbon. 
TIER 1 METHOD 
In the Tier 1c method, it is good practice to use the default feedstock specific CCFs in Table 3.30, and in the 
Tier 1b it is good practice to use the default feedstock specific FRFs and CCFs. These default values often 
represent midpoint or mean values of data sets (as determined by expert analysis). In the Tier 1a method, it is 
good practice to use the default FRFj and CCFj for the feedstock j giving the highest combined value (FRFj * 
CCFj) for the factors. This feedstock j should be among the commonly used feedstock types in the country, and 
the FRFj and CCFj should be used for the entire production. If no qualitative information on feedstock types is 
available, the general default factors might be used. The general default factors are weighted averages of the 
respective feedstock specific factors, based on global production figures.

Notes: 
1 When uncertainty range is not given in the referenced literature for a given factor, a default uncertainty of ±20% is chosen. When only 
one literature value is found, a default minimum uncertainty of ±15% is chosen. 
2 The factors are also found in Table 1.3 Default values of carbon content in Volume 2. 
3 Hydrogen production from coal is currently dominated by use of coking coal as feedstock. Where coal of other quality is used, then it is 
good practice in the Tier 1 method to: (i) apply the FRF for coking coal with an uncertainty range of ±30% when the Tier 1b method is 
used, and (ii) apply a default CCF that reflects the specific coal type (e.g. lignite, sub-bituminous, other bituminous) as presented in Table 
1.3 of Volume 2.

TIER 2 METHOD 
For the Tier 2c method it is good practice to use country-specific CCFs, and to quality check these factors 
against the default factors in Table 3.30. 
For the Tier 2b method, it is good practice to use country-specific FRFs and CCFs, and to quality check these 
factors against the default factors in Table 3.30 to ensure good factor quality.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
Plant-level activity data on total fuel and feedstock requirement combined with CCF or hydrogen production 
combined with CCF and FRF by production technology and feedstock type provide the most rigorous data for 
calculating CO2 emissions from hydrogen production. In the Tier 3 methods, it is good practice to use plant and 
feedstock specific CCFs, or plant, process and feedstock specific FRFs and CCFs, and to quality check these 
factors against the default factors in Table 3.30 to ensure good factor quality. The carbon content (CCF) is a key 
emission factor variable for deriving the quantity of CO2 emissions in all Tier methods. Derivation of emissions 
using plant-level hydrogen production also depends on an accurate estimate of the fuel requirement per unit of 
output (FRF), along with information on the other variables. 
3.11.2.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
For all methods, it is good practice to gather activity data on hydrogen production from national or regional data 
sources (e.g. statistical agencies, regulatory agencies, plant operators, trade associations, researchers) in order to 
minimise the risk of gaps and double-counting in the inventory (Box 3.16). Data on CO2 recovered from 
hydrogen production (for use downstream, or to storage) should also be sought. It is good practice to use the Tier 
method giving the lowest overall uncertainty. 
TIER 1 METHOD 
National or regional level activity data may be used in the Tier 1 methods:  
• 
In the Tier 1c method, feedstock consumption data by type of feedstock should be used;  
• 
In the Tier 1b method, hydrogen production data by type of feedstock should be used;  
• 
In the Tier 1a method, total hydrogen production data should be used.  
If feedstock consumption or hydrogen production data are not available for the Tier 1c method, production 
capacity data may be used instead. If the inventory compiler can document that utilisation for a year was below 
capacity, it is good practice to multiply the total national or regional production capacity by a default capacity 
utilisation factor of 80 percent ± 10 percent (i.e., a range of 70-90 percent) through the entire time-series, or a 
country-specific capacity utilisation factor. If production capacity data are used for the base year and actual 
production data are used for later years, a country-specific capacity utilisation factor should be used for all years 
with production capacity data. It is good practice to estimate this capacity utilisation factor as the actual 
hydrogen production divided by the production capacity of at least one overlapping year adjacent to the years 
with production capacity data.  
It is good practice to obtain the biogenic share of the feedstock, to estimate the CO2 emissions to be excluded 
from the Hydrogen production sector and reported in a memo item. If the biogenic share cannot be obtained, it is 
good practice to assume that all feedstock is fossil.  
Where feedstock data are obtained in tonnes, the default calorific values in Ch. 1, Vol. 2 of 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines can be used to convert to energy units.  
TIER 2 METHOD 
The Tier 2 methods requires the same activity data as the Tier 1 method labelled with the same letter (i.e. the 
same sub-Tier). The biogenic share of the feedstock should be obtained from the producers, and the estimated 
biogenic CO2 emissions should be excluded from the Hydrogen production sector and reported in a memo item.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
The Tier 3 methods require the collection of plant-level activity data by production method and type of feedstock, 
including plant-level data on recovered CO2, where applicable. Production capacity data should not be used. The 
biogenic share of the feedstock should be obtained from the producers, to estimate the CO2 emissions to be 
excluded from the Hydrogen production sector and reported in a memo item.  
Where access to plant-level data may be limited due to confidentiality, then inventory compilers should refer to 
guidance presented in Volume 1, Chapter 2 Approaches to Data Collection.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
      3.49 
 
3.11.2.4 COMPLETENESS 
In countries where only a subset of plants report data for the Tier 3 method or where there is a transition from 
Tier 2 to Tier 3, it may not be possible to report according to Tier 3 for all facilities during the transition. Where 
data for the Tier 3 method is not available for all plants, Tier 2 could be used for the remaining plants. If a mix of 
Tiers is used, it is good practice to report the lower Tier as the applied method. If the estimation uses a mix of c 
and b Tiers, it is good practice to report as method the one giving the highest uncertainty. 
To avoid double counting, emissions from the production of hydrogen as a by-product or intermediate product 
being reported under other sectors, including Ammonia production and Methanol production (IPPU), Petroleum 
refining (Energy), must be excluded from hydrogen production. 
Recovered CO2 which is used in downstream sectors or sent to permanent storage should be subtracted from 
hydrogen production, to avoid double counting with downstream sectors.  
Biogenic CO2 emissions should be excluded from the Hydrogen production sector and allocated to a memo item, 
to avoid double counting with the AFOLU sector. 
See Box 3.16 for more details on double counting and gaps. 
3.11.2.5 DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Recalculation of CO2 emissions should be made for all years whenever emission calculation methods are 
changed (e.g., if the inventory compiler changes from the use of default values to actual values determined at the 
plant level). If plant-specific data on hydrogen production and consumed feedstock, and data on recovered CO2 
and stored C, are not available for all years in the time series, it will be necessary to consider how current data 
can be used to recalculate emissions for previous years. It may be possible to apply current factors to data from 
previous years, provided that the production technology has not changed substantially.  
Recalculation is required to ensure that any changes in emissions trends are real and not an artefact of changes in 
estimation methods. It is good practice to recalculate the time series according to the guidance provided in 
Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
3.11.3 Uncertainty assessment 
3.11.3.1 EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
It is good practice to obtain uncertainty estimates at the same level (i.e. national, regional or plant) as the activity 
data. In case of plant level data, the uncertainty should be lower than uncertainty values associated with default 
values. The same applies to country-specific factors. 
Feedstock requirement factors (FRFs): Uncertainty in the default FRFs arise from variation between plants in 
how efficiently the hydrogen is produced. Three factors are decisive to the level of uncertainty: 1) the process 
efficiency, i.e. how much fuel is combusted for process heat per tonne of produced hydrogen, 2) the chemical 
composition of the feedstock, i.e. the hydrogen to carbon ratio, and 3) the specific energy content of the 
feedstock. Feedstock specific factors have lower uncertainty than the general default factor, because the latter 
contain the variation in process efficiency, chemical composition and specific energy content between different 
types of feedstock. Plant specific factors have even lower uncertainties. Estimation methods using FRFs (Tier b 
and a methods) have higher overall uncertainty than methods not using the fuel requirement factors (Tier c 
methods), ceteris paribus, because the Tier b and a methods include one uncertain element (FRF) that is not 
included in the Tier c methods. 
Carbon content factors (CCFs): Uncertainty in the default CCFs is resulting from variation in 1) the chemical 
composition of the feedstock, i.e. the hydrogen to carbon ratio, and 2) the specific energy content of the 
feedstock. Uncertainty arise from variation in composition and energy content of a specific material used as 
feedstock (for example between different types of coal), and from variation in composition and energy content of 
feedstocks with a heterogeneous composition (for example waste). Feedstock specific factors have lower 
uncertainty than the general default factor, because the latter contain the variation between different types of 
feedstock. Plant specific factors have even lower uncertainties. 
In the Tier 1a method, if the highest default CCF value among the feedstock types used in the country is used for 
the entire production, a country-specific uncertainty estimate or alternatively a default increase in the remaining 
uncertainty of 20 percentage points in the downward direction (only) should be used. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use  
 
  
3.50           
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 
3.11.3.2 ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Where the activity data are obtained at the plant-specific level, uncertainty estimates may be obtained directly 
from the hydrogen producers. These activity data are likely to be highly accurate (i.e., with uncertainty as low as 
±2 percent). This includes uncertainty estimates for feedstock use (Tier c methods) or hydrogen production (Tier 
b and a methods), as well as CO2 recovered and stored solid carbon. Data that are obtained from national 
statistical agencies usually do not include uncertainty estimates. It is good practice to consult with national 
statistical agencies to obtain information on any uncertainty. Where national statistical agencies collect data from 
the population of hydrogen production facilities, uncertainties in national statistics are not expected to differ 
from uncertainties established from plant-level consultations. Where uncertainty values are not available from 
other sources, a default value of ±5 percent can be used for activity data from national statistical agencies. 
If plant-specific data are not available for all years in the time series, and current data are used to recalculate 
emissions for previous years, the uncertainty in emission estimates might increase due to changes in production 
technology. It is good practice to increase the uncertainty values accordingly.  
Where uncertainty values are not available from other sources, a default increase of ±20 percent in the 
uncertainty can be used for previous reference years estimates based on data on current years. 
Where estimates are made to split the fossil and biogenic parts of a mixed feedstock in the Tier 1 and 2 methods, 
a default uncertainty of ±5 percent should be added to the biogenic part if it is based on reported figures, and ±20 
percent if it is estimated. The same uncertainty, in absolute amounts, should be added to the fossil part.  
3.11.4 Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
3.11.4.1 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. More extensive quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures are applicable, if higher tier methods are used to determine 
emissions. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Comparison of emission factors 
Inventory compilers should check if the estimated factors are within the range of default factors, and also ensure 
that the emission factors are consistent with the values derived from analysis of the process chemistry. For 
example, the CO2 generation rate based on natural gas should not be less than 5.46 tonne of CO2 per tonne of 
hydrogen produced7. If the emission factors are outside of the estimated range of default factors, it is good 
practice to assess and document the plant-specific or country-specific conditions that account for the differences.  
Comparison of activity data 
It is useful to collect and report activity data comprising both process input data (feedstock consumption) and 
process output data (hydrogen production), to control the relation between them.  
It is good practice to cross-check that all emissions from downstream use of recovered CO2 is accounted for in 
the corresponding downstream IPPU or other sector(s). 
Plant-specific data check 
The following plant-specific data are required for adequate auditing of emissions estimates at the Tier 3 level: 
• 
Calculations and estimation method;  
• 
List of assumptions;  
• 
Documentation of any plant-specific measurement method, and measurement results;  
QC procedures in use at the site should be directly referenced and included in the QC plan. If the measurement 
practices were not consistent with QC standards, the inventory compiler should reconsider the use of these data. 
 
7 Method: 44.011 tonne CO2 / 8.064 tonne H = 5.46 tonne of CO2 per tonne of H2 produced, based on molar weights of 
12.011 (C), 16.00 (O), 1.008 (H) and 100 percent production yield (i.e. no by-products produced, no fuel combustion to 
produce heat and no feedstock loss in the production process). 
 Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
      3.51 
 
3.11.4.2 REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11.  
Some examples of specific documentation and reporting that may be relevant to this source category are 
provided below: 
• 
Description of the method used; 
• 
Number of hydrogen main product production plants; 
• 
Feedstock requirement factors; 
• 
Carbon content factors; 
• 
Feedstock consumption data; 
• 
Production data; 
• 
Production capacity; 
• 
CO2 recovery data; 
• 
Downstream use and permanent storage of recovered CO2; 
• 
Stored solid carbon data; 
• 
Any other assumptions. 
Ideally, plant operators should supply this information to the inventory compiler for compilation, and also 
archive the information at the site. Plant operators should also log and archive the measurement frequencies and 
instrumental calibration records where actual plant measurements are made. 
Where such inventory data (e.g. plant- or company-specific production data) may be considered confidential (e.g. 
where there are only one or two producers in a country), then inventory compilers should refer to guidance 
presented in Volume 1, Chapter 2 Approaches to Data Collection. In these cases, operators and the inventory 
compiler should seek to determine the level of aggregation at which information can be reported while still 
protecting confidentiality. Detailed information including instrumentation records should still be archived at the 
plant level. 
It is not practical to include all documentation in the national inventory report. However, the inventory should 
include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that the reported emissions estimates are 
transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced.

ANNEX 3A.1 DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS FOR 
SECTION 3.10.2 EMISSIONS FROM 
PRODUCTION OF FLUORINATED 
COMPOUNDS (OTHER THAN HFC-23 
EMISSIONS FROM HCFC-22 PRODUCTION) 
This annex provides background information for the Tier 1 default emission factors for fluorinated greenhouse 
gases (GHG) from fluorochemical production, that are provided in section 3.10.2 in the 2019 Refinement to the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines. The first section discusses the default emission factors for SF6 and NF3 production based 
on literature search, and the second section discusses the default emission factor estimated from the data reported 
to the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.   
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Tier 1 default emission factor for production of fluorinated gases other than SF6 and NF3 was developed 
based on emissions and throughput (production and transformation) information reported to the U.S. Greenhouse 
Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The factor is intended to represent uncontrolled emissions. Under the 
GHGRP, fluorinated GHG emissions are reported annually on a facility basis and include facilities with and 
without abatement.  Depending on the year, 14 to 16 fluorochemical production facilities have reported under the 
Program. Facilities that abate their emissions report their level of abatement for each process as a range. To 
develop emission factors on an uncontrolled basis, the pre-abatement emissions of each facility were estimated 
using the arithmetic averages of the abatement ranges reported by that facility for its processes. Then, for each 
facility, this estimate was divided by the total quantity of fluorinated gases produced or transformed by that 
facility to obtain an uncontrolled emission factor for that facility and year.  This was done for all six years for 
which the US EPA had data at the time the factor was developed. For each facility, the emission factors for each 
year were then averaged over the six years of reporting, and the resulting facility averages were averaged to 
obtain the default factor. Because the reporting U.S. facilities use multiple manufacturing methods to produce a 
wide array of fluorochemicals, averaging the facility-specific emission factors is expected to provide a default 
emission factor that is applicable where the manufacturing method is unknown, as is often the case in a Tier 1 
calculation. 
The uncertainty of the default emission factor was assessed using several methods, including sensitivity analyses, 
Monte Carlo analysis, and statistical analyses. As discussed further below in section 3A.1.5, these analyses 
showed that the selected factor was robust despite uncertainties in the reported data, such as the reporting of 
destruction efficiencies as a range rather than a single value. However, the analyses also indicated that the 
uncertainty in the emission factor for any single facility is quite large, and is dictated by the fact that true 
uncontrolled emission rates naturally vary from facility to facility depending on the fluorochemicals produced 
and the type of manufacturing method used to produce them. 
3A.1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR SECTION 3.10.2 TIER 1 
DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS – FROM THE LITERATURE 
The literature shows a broad range of emission factors for different gases and even for the same gas when it is 
produced for different applications. For SF6 produced in Japan, a factor of 0.08 kg emitted/kg produced was 
found for facilities whose customers require highly purified SF6 gas (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing). The 
emission factor is relatively large because of handling losses during disposal of residual gas (i.e., the ‘heel’ that 
is not used or recycled) in returned cylinders (Suizu, 1999).  An SF6 emission factor has been reported as 0.03 kg 
emitted/kg of sales (O’Connell, 2002).   
U.S. and Japanese NF3 manufacturers have reported an emission factor for NF3 emissions of 0.02 in 2009, with a 
goal of eventually achieving an emission factor of 0.005 kg emitted/kg produced (it is not known whether the 
0.005 factor is based on pre-abatement emissions or controlled, post-abatement emissions) (Fthenakis, 2010).  
CF4 and N2O are generated as a by-product during NF3 manufacture, and N2O and CF4 can be formed at rates of 
0.03 kg emitted/kg produced and less than 0.01 kg emitted/kg produced, respectively, relative to the mass of NF3 
formed during electrolysis (these emission factors are on an uncontrolled, pre-abatement basis) (Tasaka, 2004; 
2007).  Some process-specific emission factor data are available from commercially available life cycle 
assessment software; these EFs may be acceptable should sufficient documentation of their units, source data, 
and calculation exist. 
In another reference focused on SF6 produced in Germany, an emission factor of 0.002 kg emitted/kg of the total 
quantity of SF6 produced was found for facilities whose customers do not require highly purified SF6 gas (e.g., 
electrical equipment, insulated windows) (Preisegger, 1999).  Unfortunately, it is not known whether the 0.002 
 Chapter 3: Chemical Industry Emissions 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
      3.53 
 
kg emitted/kg produced factor is based on pre-abatement emissions or controlled, post-abatement emissions, and 
therefore it should not be used for Tier 1 estimates.  The authors note the value here for informational purposes 
and to acknowledge that the data were reviewed for the Tier 1 methodology.  
3A.1.2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR SECTION 3.10.2 TIER 1 
DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS – ALL OTHER FLUORINATED GHG 
3A.1.2.1 
Source of Data 
The U.S. GHGRP8 requires certain facilities that emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) and certain suppliers of fossil 
fuels and industrial GHGs to report their emissions or supplies (along with other relevant data) annually to the 
US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In general, reporting requirements apply to facilities or suppliers 
that meet or exceed thresholds that are equivalent to emissions of 25,000 metric tonne of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq.)  
per year. Facilities and reporters collect data for the calendar year and report those data to EPA electronically in 
the following year by March 31.9  The US EPA verifies10 the data and then publishes it.  The GHGs covered 
include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), and other fluorinated gases (e.g., nitrogen trifluoride, 
hydrofluoroethers [HFEs], perfluorinated amines, etc.).  
The default emission factor for fluorochemical production is based on data reported under two sections of the 
GHGRP regulation—subpart L, Fluorinated Gas Production, and subpart OO, Suppliers of Industrial Greenhouse 
Gases—for reporting years (RY)11 2011 to 2016. Under subpart L, facilities that produce a fluorinated gas (other 
than HCFC-22 12) must report their fluorinated GHG emissions from the production and transformation of 
fluorinated gases, from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, and from destruction of 
previously produced fluorinated GHGs. The emissions reported from production and transformation include both 
emissions from process vents and emissions from equipment leaks. Under subpart OO, fluorinated GHG 
suppliers (including fluorinated GHG producers) must report the quantities of each fluorinated GHG that they 
produce, transform, destroy, import, or export. 
3A.1.2.2 
Data Used in Development of the Fluorinated GHG Emissions 
Factor 
The emission factor was developed from: (1) the emissions from production and transformation processes and 
emissions from venting of residual fluorinated GHGs from containers, and (2) the quantities of fluorinated 
GHGs produced and transformed. Facilities reporting emissions under subpart L provide information on 
emissions from production and transformation processes at two levels of aggregation and in two metrics: 
• 
For the facility as a whole, emissions are provided by specific fluorinated GHG compound in metric tonne 
where the facility makes more than one product and where the emissions of that compound equal or exceed 
1,000 metric tonne CO2eq. across all processes. Where total emissions of a compound across all processes 
are less than 1,000 metric tonne CO2eq., emissions are reported by fluorinated GHG group13 in metric tonne 
CO2eq. Where the facility makes only one product, emissions are reported by compound when that 
compound is the same as the product; otherwise they are reported by fluorinated GHG group in metric tonne 
CO2eq.  
• 
For each production and transformation process at the facility, emissions are reported by process and 
fluorinated GHG group in metric tonne CO2eq.  
The global warming potentials (GWPs) used to calculate CO2-equivalent emissions are drawn from the IPCC 
Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), or then a default GWP is used. For 
 
8 The GHGRP regulation can be found in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at Title 40, Part 98. For background 
information on and data from the GHGRP, please see <https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting>

10 For information on how EPA verifies data submitted under the GHGRP, please see 
<https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-07/documents/ghgrp_verification_factsheet.pdf>. 
11 The term “reporting year (RY)” refers to the year in which the emissions occurred.  
12 Facilities that produce HCFC-22 are required to report their emissions under a separate part of the GHGRP, Subpart O. The 
emission factor being developed here is intended to apply to production of fluorochemicals other than HCFC-22 (which is 
covered in section 3.10.1 of the F), and therefore emissions from HCFC-22 production are not discussed further here. 
13 There are twelve fluorinated GHG groups, each of which encompasses a set of GHGs with roughly similar atmospheric 
behaviour, including similar GWPs and atmospheric lifetimes. These include, e.g., fully fluorinated GHGs such as PFCs 
and SF6, HFCs with two or fewer hydrogen-carbon bonds, HFCs with more than two carbon-hydrogen bonds, unsaturated 
HFCs and PFCs, etc. (See Table A3.1.3 for a full list.) Compounds that do not have GWPs in either the Fourth Assessment 
Report (AR4) or AR5 are assigned a default GWP that is generally based on the average GWP for the fluorinated GHG 
group of which the compound is a member.

most fluorinated GHG groups, the default GWP is the average of the GWPs of all the fluorinated GHGs in that 
group that have GWP values in AR4 or AR5.14  Where we use emissions reported in CO2eq. in our calculations, 
we back-calculate the emissions in metric tonne using the same set of GWPs used to calculate the CO2eq. 
emissions.  
For the processes, facilities also report the range into which the destruction efficiency (DE) of each process falls. 
(The DE is based on the extent to which emissions from process vents are controlled. Emissions from equipment 
leaks are not included in the DE calculation.)  Table 3A.1.1 provides the DE ranges available for facilities to 
report and the DE assumptions for each.

Facilities reporting emissions of residual fluorinated GHGs from container venting report emissions in metric 
tonne of each fluorinated GHG. 
The activity data for the emission factor was compiled from reporting of the quantities of fluorinated GHGs 
produced and transformed that were reported under subpart OO.  
A3.1.2.3 
Calculation of Emissions from Production and Transformation 
Processes 
a. 
Actual Emissions by Specific Fluorinated GHG for Production and 
Transformation Processes 
Actual emissions of specific fluorinated GHGs reported under subpart L for production and transformation 
processes are provided in Table 3A.1.2.  Table 3A.1.2 provides actual emissions by specific fluorinated GHG for 
production and transformation processes in metric tonne, and also provides actual GWP-weighted emissions by 
specific fluorinated GHG for production and transformation processes in metric tonne CO2eq.  Actual emissions 
are those emissions that actually occur to the atmosphere and reflect the level of control for the process.  These 
totals include only the portion of production and transformation process emissions that are reported by specific 
fluorinated GHG (approximately 98 percent of production and transformation emissions in metric tonne 
CO2eq.).15  
b. 
Actual Emissions by Fluorinated GHG Group 
Actual emissions of fluorinated GHGs reported under subpart L are provided by fluorinated GHG group for each 
production and transformation process.  Table 3A.1.3 provides actual fluorinated GHG emissions in metric tonne 
CO2eq. by fluorinated GHG group. The group totals include all emissions from production and transformation 
processes. 
c. 
Estimated Emissions Prior to Control by Fluorinated GHG Group 
Uncontrolled emissions (i.e., pre-abatement emissions) for production and transformation processes were 
estimated based on the destruction efficiency (DE) range provided by facilities when they reported on each 
process, along with the actual fluorinated GHG emissions reported in metric tonne CO2eq.  Because facilities 
provide the range in which the DE falls rather than the exact DE, an assumption of the true DE must be made.   
 
14 For fluorinated GHG groups that have average GWPs below one, including unsaturated HFCs and PFCs, fluorotelomer 
alcohols, and compounds with carbon-iodine bonds, a default value of one is used, but as discussed further below, these 
compounds are excluded from this analysis. 
15 The tables in this discussion and subsequent estimated pre-abatement emission discussions exclude compounds with GWPs 
near or below 1 (i.e., unsaturated PFCs, HFCs, etc.; fluorotelomer alcohols; and fluorinated GHGs with carbon-iodide 
bonds) because these compounds account for only 0.01 percent of the GWP-weighted emissions reported under subpart L 
and, as discussed further in section A3.1.5, including them introduces large uncertainties into the emission factor expressed 
in units of metric tonne.

We reviewed four DE assumptions, along with the uncontrolled emissions implied by these assumptions, to 
ensure that the default emission factor was as robust and accurate as possible.16 These included:  
1. A lower-bound assumption that assumed that the DE for each process was always equal to the lower 
bound of the DE range reported for that process. This results in an absolute lower-bound estimate of 
uncontrolled emissions. Uncontrolled emissions from any facility cannot fall below the level implied by 
this assumption. 
2. An upper-bound assumption that assumed that the DE for each process was always equal to the upper 
bound of the DE range reported for that process. This results in an absolute upper-bound estimate of 
uncontrolled emissions.17 Uncontrolled emissions from any facility cannot fall above the level implied 
by this assumption.  
3. An arithmetic mean assumption that assumed that the DE for each process was equal to the straight 
average of the upper and lower bound of the DE range reported for that process. This is expected to be 
an unbiased estimator of uncontrolled emissions if a DE is equally likely to fall anywhere within the 
range and uncontrolled emissions are also equally likely to fall anywhere within the range (that is, 
uncontrolled emissions across processes and facilities are not expected to be higher at one end of the 
range than the other).  
4. A geometric mean assumption that assumed that the DE for each process was equal to 1 minus the 
geometric mean of the fractions emitted at the DE range bounds reported for that process. (In Excel 
using MS Excel functions, this is summarized by the formula (1-GEOMEAN((1-LB),(1-UB)). This is 
expected to be an unbiased estimator of uncontrolled emissions if a DE is equally likely to fall 
anywhere within the range and uncontrolled emissions, across processes and facilities, grow 
exponentially as the DE increases. 
The emissions prior to control for production and transformation processes are calculated using Equation 3A.1.1.

Table 3A.1.4 provides the estimated pre-abatement emissions by fluorinated GHG group (in metric tonne CO2eq.) 
when each DE assumption is used to estimate pre-abatement emissions.  
d. Selection of Arithmetic Mean as Basis for Estimates.  
As the basis for our best estimates of uncontrolled emissions, we considered both the arithmetic and geometric 
means of the DE ranges. Choosing the appropriate DE assumption is based on the distribution of the emissions 
within each DE range.  If the uncontrolled emissions are increasing exponentially across the range, then 
application of the geometric mean is more appropriate.  If the uncontrolled emissions are constant across the 
range, then application of the arithmetic mean is more appropriate. Exponentially rising uncontrolled emissions 
would be consistent with a control strategy that selectively targeted the streams with the highest GWP-weighted 
emissions. It is clear that facilities tend to prioritize the control of high GWP streams and that this is often the 
first consideration in determining whether a stream will be controlled.  In addition to high GWP, however, 
facilities also include other considerations in their decisions regarding which streams to send to a destruction 
device.  Other considerations may include technical considerations, regulatory requirements, and safety concerns. 
Technical considerations include things such as the distance from the process to the destruction device for 
routing a vent to a control device, or the need to drop down the stream pressure prior to venting to a control 
device.  Some facilities will have the technical expertise to overcome these issues while others may not.  Another 
consideration is regulatory requirements or market forces that may affect whether a stream is controlled. In 
 
16 As discussed in section A3.1.5 below, we also performed a Monte Carlo analysis to assess the uncertainty of the emission 
factor estimate, including the uncertainty of the exact DE as well as other uncertainties. 
17 This is unconditionally true for the first three DE ranges, but for the last one (>99 percent), we must choose a realistic 
upper bound because using a value of 100 percent would result in infinite pre-abatement emissions. We chose 99.99 
percent, but we could have chosen 99.9 or 99.999 percent instead, with a factor of 10 difference either way for the pre-
abatement emissions in this DE range. We also used the 99.99 percent upper bound to calculate the arithmetic and 
geometric means for the highest DE range.

addition, safety is a consideration. For example, there may be instances where the destruction device is down and 
not operating, and for safety reasons a process that is mid-process may be vented directly to the atmosphere. 
Table 3A.1.4 provides the controlled emissions (actual) in metric CO2eq., as well as the uncontrolled emissions 
in metric tonne CO2eq. estimated using the lower bound of the DE range, the arithmetic mean of the DE range, 
the geometric mean of the DE range, and the upper bound of the DE range.  These emissions include the full set 
of emissions from production and transformation processes. Note that the lower-bound uncontrolled emissions 
are approximately four times as large as the controlled emissions (though this varies by year). The estimates of 
uncontrolled emissions under the various DE assumptions span a factor of almost 30: the arithmetic-mean 
uncontrolled emissions are approximately twice as large as the lower-bound uncontrolled emissions, the 
geometric-mean uncontrolled emissions are approximately two and a half times as large as the arithmetic-mean 
uncontrolled emissions, and the upper-bound uncontrolled emissions are approximately seven times as large as 
the geometric-mean uncontrolled emissions.

One author compiled data on DEs achieved for one fluorochemical production process over several years, and 
these data showed a geometric distribution. However, there was no way to be certain that the distribution for this 
single process applied to the hundreds of other processes whose emissions are reported under subpart L. Thus, 
we selected the arithmetic mean, which assumes that uncontrolled emissions are flat as the DE increases, as the 
basis for our estimates of uncontrolled emissions.  For this reason, the detailed analysis below focuses on the 
arithmetic mean scenario, but summary information is provided for the other scenarios to show the sensitivity of 
uncontrolled emissions to different DE assumptions.  Table 3A.1.5 provides the uncontrolled emissions by 
fluorinated GHG group (in metric tonne CO2eq.) estimated using the arithmetic mean of the DE range. The 
estimates in Table 3A.1.5 are used in section 3.1.4 to develop the profile of specific fluorinated GHGs emitted in 
a pre-abatement scenario.

Container Venting Emissions 
Container venting, or container evacuation, is another source of emissions that is common to fluorinated gas 
production facilities.  Emissions from container venting occurred at 6 of the 16 facilities in the U.S. over 
RY2011 through RY2016.  It is anticipated that all container venting emissions are uncontrolled, so no DE 
assumption is necessary.  Table A3.1.6 provides actual GHG emissions for container venting in metric tonne 
CO2eq., by individual facility. In later tables, container venting emissions have been included in the emission 
values along with the emissions from production and transformation processes.

Facilities that produce and transform fluorinated GHGs report the production and transformation quantities to the 
GHGRP under subpart OO.  These data are considered confidential business information on an individual 
facility basis, and are therefore not publicly available. Table A3.1.7 provides total aggregate fluorinated GHG 
data on a metric tonne basis for production and transformation processes for subpart OO.

3A.1.3 EMISSION FACTOR DEVELOPMENT FOR FLUORINATED GHGS  
3A.1.3.1 
Estimated pre-abatement emission in metric tonne for Average 
Emissions Factor Analysis 
The average emission factor was developed in terms of metric tonne of emissions.  To support this analysis, 
calculations that estimate the pre-abatement emissions of fluorinated GHG on a metric ton basis must be 
performed. 
The calculations that result in the emissions shown in Table 3A.1.5 above yield GWP-weighted, estimated pre-
abatement emissions in metric tonne of CO2eq. for each production or transformation process.  To estimate 
emissions in metric tonne prior to control, we need a way to estimate the weighted average GWP for each 
facility and reporting year, to account for the fact that fluorinated GHGs with different GWPs may be controlled 
at different levels. That is, the GWP distribution of actual emissions may not match the GWP distribution of pre-
abatement emissions. We can then divide the emissions in metric tonne of CO2eq. by the corresponding GWP to 
calculate the emissions in metric tons.  (Recall that the US EPA receives DE range information on a process 
basis, but does not receive data on individual fluorinated GHGs by process.) The steps we followed to derive the 
GWPs are outlined below. 
a. 
Weighted-average GWP of controlled emissions. We first calculated the weighted-average GWP of the 
controlled emissions for each facility and year by dividing (1) the total actual emissions reported by each facility 
for all production and transformation processes in metric tonne of CO2eq. by (2) the emissions calculated for 
each facility in metric tons. 18  However, we cannot necessarily apply this weighted average GWP to the 
estimated pre-abatement emissions calculated for that facility and year. Because facilities may control emissions 
with different GWPs to varying extents, the average GWP of the pre-abatement emissions may be different from 
the average GWP of the actual emissions. 
b. 
Factor to Calculate Weighted-average GWP for Estimated Pre-abatement Emissions. To account for 
different control levels that may be applied to fluorinated GHGs having different GWPs, we used the process-
level reporting of actual emissions by fluorinated GHG group in metric tonne of CO2eq., as well as our 
calculations of pre-abatement emissions based on these numbers. Where processes that emit higher-GWP 
fluorinated GHG groups are controlled to a greater extent than processes that emit lower-GWP fluorinated GHG 
groups, the calculated emissions of the former will grow more than the calculated emissions of the latter as one 
moves from the controlled to the pre-abatement scenario. This signal appears in the pre-abatement emissions 
calculated under the DE assumption in section A3.1.2.3.c above. We can use this signal, along with assumptions 
about the average GWP of each fluorinated GHG group, to estimate how the weighted-average GWP has 
changed from the controlled scenario. Using this approach, we developed a ratio of the weighted-average GWP 
of the estimated pre-abatement emissions to the weighted-average GWP of the actual emissions for each facility 
and reporting year, and multiplied this ratio by the GWP of the controlled emissions calculated in Step a. 
Specifically, we performed the following calculations: 
 
18 Emissions in metric tonne are calculated as the sum of the emissions that are reported by specific fluorinated GHG in 
metric tonne (reported in metric tonne of fluorinated GHG), plus the estimated emissions of fluorinated GHGs whose 
emissions are reported by fluorinated GHG group in metric tonne CO2eq., after conversion to metric tonne. For the latter, 
the GWP-weighted emissions are divided by the average GWP for each group to calculate emissions in metric tonne.

1. 
For each facility and reporting year, we assumed that the emissions of each fluorinated GHG group had the 
average GWP of that group and divided the metric tonne of CO2eq. emissions for that group by the 
weighted-average GWP to obtain estimates of emissions in metric tonne. We then totaled both metric tonne 
CO2eq. and metric tonne for all groups, and divided the first by the second to get a weighted-average GWP 
(uncontrolled) for that facility and year.  
2. 
Then we divided the weighted-average GWP (pre-abatement) for each facility and reporting year by the 
GWP for the actual controlled scenario for that facility and year to obtain a set of ratios.  
3. 
Finally, we multiplied these ratios by the weighted-average GWPs (for each facility and year) that we 
calculated for the controlled (actual) scenario in Step a. 
The estimated pre-abatement fluorinated GHG emissions, in metric tonne, for production and transformation 
processes based on the adjusted GWP are provided for the arithmetic mean DE assumption, by individual facility 
in Table 3A.1.8.

3A.1.3.2 
Metric of the Emission Factor 
The goal of our analysis was to develop an emission factor in terms of metric tonne of fluorinated GHG 
emissions divided by metric tonne of fluorinated gas produced and transformed (Total emissions in metric tonne 
/ production and transformation quantity produced, in metric tonne). This is because any GWPs or other metrics 
used to express fluorinated gas emissions relative to CO2 may go out of date after publication of the emission 
factor, potentially reducing the applicability of the factor.19     
We developed an unweighted average EF (i.e., average across facilities of each facility’s emission factor, where 
that factor equals the facility’s emissions divided by the sum of that facility’s production and transformation).  
We also examined the standard deviation of the facility-specific emission factors. For an average, each facility is 
weighted equally and facilities with comparatively larger or smaller EF values influence the average value even 
if the quantities that they produce and/or transform are small.  The average emission factor, based on an average, 
was calculated to be 0.04 metric tonne fluorinated GHG emissions per metric tonne quantity produced and 
transformed.

The emission factor in Table A3.1.9 is expressed in terms of metric tonne emitted per metric tonne produced or 
transformed. To be of use for an emissions inventory, knowledge of, or assumptions regarding, the fluorinated 
GHGs emitted is necessary. This section summarizes the data and approach used for identifying the most emitted 
fluorinated GHGs from fluorochemical production based on the data reported by facilities to the U.S. GHGRP.   
3A.1.4.1 
Develop Ratios for Most Emitted Fluorinated GHG Emissions 
Analysis 
To identify the most emitted fluorinated GHGs, the analysis begins with comparing the actual emissions by 
fluorinated GHG group (summarized in Table A3.1.3) with the estimated pre-abatement emissions (the estimated 
pre-abatement emissions are shown in Table A3.1.5).  The DE range is provided for each production and 
transformation process but is not provided for individual specific fluorinated GHGs. To calculate these pre-
abatement emissions, we need a way to estimate the unweighted metric tonne for each fluorinated GHG group 
and reporting year. The calculations in Table A3.1.5 yield GWP-weighted, pre-abatement emissions in metric 
tonne CO2eq. for each production or transformation process.  A ratio of the pre-abatement emissions in metric 
tonne CO2eq. compared to the actual emissions in metric tonne CO2eq. can be developed for each fluorinated 
GHG group and reporting year.  These ratios can then be applied to the actual emissions of specific fluorinated 
GHG in metric tonne CO2eq. to appropriately estimate the pre-abatement level of specific fluorinated GHG in 
metric tonne. (Recall that the US EPA does not receive data on unweighted emissions, metric tonne, of 
individual fluorinated GHGs by process.) The ratios of pre-abatement metric tonne CO2eq. compared to actual 
metric tonne CO2eq. are provided in Table A3.1.10. 
A3.1.4.2 
Pre-abatement Emissions in metric tonne CO2eq. and metric tonne 
for Specific Fluorinated GHGs, for Production and Transformation Processes, 
and Container Venting 
 
19 We also reviewed factors using GWP-weighted emissions and production/transformation quantities because they provided 
insight into how the GWPs of fluorinated GHGs emitted relate to the GWPs of fluorinated gases produced across facilities.

Applying the ratios in Table A3.1.10 to the Table A3.1.2 actual emissions provides the pre-abatement emissions 
by fluorinated GHG (in metric tonne CO2eq.). The ratios were multiplied by the specific fluorinated GHG, based 
on its fluorinated GHG group, for each reporting year.  The estimated pre-abatement emissions by specific 
fluorinated GHG, in metric tonne CO2eq. and metric tonne, are provided in Table A3.1.11 for production and 
transformation processes, along with the container venting emissions.  
A3.1.4.3 
Representative Fluorinated GHG Profile 
The most commonly emitted fluorinated GHGs on a pre-abatement emissions basis can be determined from the 
data set. The most common fluorinated GHGs, by metric tonne and by metric tonne CO2eq., are shown in Table 
A3.1.12.  Those fluorinated GHGs that do not have GWPs in any IPCC Assessment Report (e.g., the Fifth 
Assessment 
Report) 
have 
been 
dropped 
from 
the 
list 
(i.e., 
hexafluoropropylene 
oxide, 
and 
octafluorotetrahydrofuran).  The analysis shows the representative chemical composition in metric tonne for the 
top 10 fluorinated GHGs.

aThe 2019 Refinement includes separate emission factors specifically for NF3 production. As approximately 92 percent of NF3 emissions are 
from intended NF3 production, and NF3 is not commonly emitted from the production of other fluorochemicals, NF3 has been dropped from 
the analysis for representative composition.  
b These fluorinated GHGs that do not have GWPs in any IPCC Assessment Report (e.g., the Fifth Assessment Report) have been dropped 
from the analysis for representative composition. 
 
3A.1.5  UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS OF AVERAGE EMISSION FACTOR   
In addition to examining the sensitivity of calculated uncontrolled (i.e., pre-abatement) emissions to various 
assumptions regarding the DE, we performed a Monte Carlo analysis to comprehensively assess the uncertainty 
of the emission factor, given the uncertainty of the DE as well as other sources of uncertainty. The uncertainty in 
the estimated pre-abatement emission in units of metric tonne CO2eq. is based on the wide ranges of the DE. The 
uncertainty in the pre-abatement emission estimates in terms of metric tonne of fluorinated GHG is based on the 
combination of the uncertainty in the DE and the uncertainty in the average GWP of the specific fluorinated 
GHGs in the pre-abatement scenario.  With respect to the DEs, we used the following assumed distribution. 
TABLE 3A.1.13 (NEW) 
DISTRIBUTION ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE DE RANGES 
DE ranges 
Distribution Assumptions 
≥0% to <75% 
Half of the values are 0%; half of the values flat distribution between 0 and 74.9% 
≥75% to <95% 
Flat distribution between 75 and 94.9% 
≥95% to <99% 
Flat distribution between 95 and 98.9% 
≥99% 
Triangular distribution between 99 and 99.99% with mode at 99% 
 
Because we expected that a significant number of reporters using the ≥0 to <75 percent range were uncontrolled, 
we assumed a distribution function that assigns half of the distribution function to 0 percent DE.

3.72                                2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 
For estimating the uncertainty in the GWP, we evaluated the data for emissions by specific fluorinated GHG 
compound (in metric tonne of specific GHG) that was reported for the facility as a whole. We developed 
different GWP distributions for each facility and fluorinated GHG group combination based on the data reported 
for a given facility. If only one specific fluorinated GHG compound was reported for a given facility within a 
fluorinated GHG group (or if all of the specific GHGs reported by the facility were identical), the GWP of that 
compound was used directly (no uncertainty). If multiple specific fluorinated GHG compounds with different 
GWPs were reported within a fluorinated GHG group for a given facility, we calculated the weighted average 
GWP for that group based on the specific fluorinated GHG’s GWP and direct mass emissions reported by that 
facility. The weighted average GWP across all reporting years was used as the central tendency value and the 
weighted average for individual years was used to assess the range of the distribution function for the uncertainty 
analysis. In some cases, the emissions for specific fluorinated GHG compounds in a group did not exceed the 
separate reporting threshold (1,000 metric tonne CO2eq.) of subpart L, and only the metric tonne CO2eq. 
emissions for the fluorinated GHG group were reported at the facility level. In this case, the individual GWPs for 
all compounds listed within that fluorinated GHG group was used as the distribution function, and a random 
GWP was selected from those values. When we first utilized this approach, the very low-GWP fluorinated GHG 
groups (i.e., those groups whose members had GWPs near or below 1) dominated the estimated pre-abatement 
fluorinated GHG emissions (in direct mass terms), which led to huge uncertainties in the mass emission rates for 
compounds that had a negligible impact on emissions in terms of CO2eq. Consequently, we excluded the very-
low-GWP fluorinated GHG groups’ emissions when estimating the mass of fluorinated GHG compound 
emissions for developing the proposed emissions factor. For similar reasons, we used a lower GWP of 0.5 for the 
fluorinated acetates, carbonofluoridates, and fluorinated alcohols other than fluorotelomer alcohols group, rather 
than 0.05 value for 4,4,4-trifluorbutan-1-ol (CAS No. 461-18-7). It was assumed that, even if this compound was 
the primary pollutant emitted from this group, small amounts of other compounds from this group would also 
likely be emitted and that the value of 0.5 was a reasonable lower bound for this group. 
Calculations of the pre-abatement emissions (in both metric tonne CO2eq. and in metric tonne of fluorinated 
GHG group) were made using the process level emissions reported under subpart L. A Monte Carlo analysis 
using 10,000 random realizations was used to estimate the average and 95th percentile confidence intervals for 
the emissions. We assumed the uncertainty in the reported production quantities were negligible relative to the 
uncertainties in the uncontrolled emissions.  
The average annual estimated pre-abatement emissions in metric tonne CO2eq. from the Monte Carlo analysis 
compares reasonably well with but are slightly lower than the pre-abatement emissions estimates using the 
arithmetic mean DE assumption for the range. This is because the lowest and highest DE ranges were skewed 
towards the lower DE values in the Monte Carlo analysis. The total estimated pre-abatement emissions in metric 
tonne of fluorinated GHG compounds from the Monte Carlo analysis (when excluding the low GWP groups) had 
similar uncertainty ranges as the total estimated pre-abatement emissions in CO2e (which are based only on 
uncertainty of the DE) for most facilities. A few facilities that had reported generic emissions of the fluorinated 
acetates, carbonofluoridates, and fluorinated alcohols other than fluorotelomer alcohols group had much higher 
uncertainty in their mass emissions than in their CO2e emissions due to the variability and uncertainty associated 
with the GWP.  
The uncertainty in the average emission factor across all of the reporting facilities (i.e., the 95-percent 
confidence interval around the sample mean), including the uncertainties in both the DE and in the GWP of the 
emitted gases, was 20 percent.  In summary, these sources of uncertainty are mitigated by the large number of 
data points in the analysis, which come from the large number of processes and significant number of years 
covered. Thus, the errors related to the DE estimated for each individual process and to the mix of gases emitted 
tend to balance out, and the aggregate uncertainty is reduced.  
It is important to note that the uncertainty in the emission factor for any single facility is much larger than this, 
and is dictated by the fact that true pre-abatement emission rates naturally vary from facility to facility depending 
on the fluorochemicals produced and the processes used to make them. This variability appears in the U.S. EPA 
data as differences in the estimated pre-abatement emission factors across facilities, differences that persist over 
the entire time series. The year-to-year variability seen in the estimated pre-abatement emission factor for any 
one facility is generally much smaller than this facility-to-facility variability. The uncertainty shown in Table 
3A.1.9 reflects this variation among facilities. The 95 percent confidence interval (calculated based on the 
relative standard deviation among the facilities’ emission factors) is ±470 percent. Because there cannot be a 
negative emission factor on the low side, a value of 0.001 was selected as the lower uncertainty bound, as it is 
representative of lower emission factor values seen in the data set. This results in an uncertainty range for the 
Tier 1 default emission factor of 0.001 to 0.2. 
As noted in section 3A.1.2 above, the selected EF is based on the straight average analysis.  The average EF 
based on the straight average is similar to the EF based on the Monte Carlo analysis.  The overall EF that results 
from other assumptions, such as use of a weighted average or use of the geometric mean, are also provided in 
Table 3A.1.14 to provide additional context.
