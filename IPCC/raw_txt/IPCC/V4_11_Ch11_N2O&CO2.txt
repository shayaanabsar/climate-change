AND CO2 EMISSIONS FROM LIME AND UREA 
APPLICATION 
11.1 
INTRODUCTION 
Chapter 11 provides a description of the generic methodologies to be adopted for the inventory of nitrous oxide 
(N2O) emissions from managed soils, including indirect N2O emissions from additions of N to land due to 
deposition and leaching, and emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) following additions of liming materials and 
urea-containing fertiliser. 
Managed soils1 are all soils on land, including Forest Land, which is managed. For N2O, the basic three-tier 
approach is the same as used in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry 
(GPG-LULUCF) for Grassland and Cropland, and in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty 
Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (GPG2000) for agricultural soils while relevant parts of 
the GPG-LULUCF methodology have been included for Forest Land. Because the methods are based on pools 
and fluxes that can occur in all the different land-use categories and because in most cases, only national 
aggregate (i.e., non-land use specific) data are available, generic information on the methodologies, as applied at 
the national level is given here, including: 
• 
a general framework for applying the methods, and appropriate equations for the calculations; 
• 
an explanation of the processes governing N2O emissions from managed soils (direct and indirect) and CO2 
emissions from liming and urea fertilisation, and the associated uncertainties; and 
• 
choice of methods, emission factors (including default values) and activity data, and volatilisation and 
leaching factors. 
• 
If activity data are available for specific land-use categories, the equations provided can be implemented for 
specific land-use categories. 
The changes in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, relative to 1996 IPCC Guidelines, include the following: 
• 
provision of advice on estimating CO2 emissions associated with the use of urea as a fertilizer; 
• 
full sectoral coverage of indirect N2O emissions; 
• 
extensive literature review leading to revised emission factors for nitrous oxide from agricultural soils; and 
• 
removal of biological nitrogen fixation as a direct source of N2O because of the lack of evidence of 
significant emissions arising from the fixation process. 
11.2 
N2O EMISSIONS FROM MANAGED SOILS 
This section presents the methods and equations for estimating total national anthropogenic emissions of N2O 
(direct and indirect) from managed soils. The generic equations presented here can also be used for estimating 
N2O within specific land-use categories or by condition-specific variables (e.g., N additions to rice paddies) if 
the country can disaggregate the activity data to that level (i.e., N use activity within a specific land use). 
Nitrous oxide is produced naturally in soils through the processes of nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification 
is the aerobic microbial oxidation of ammonium to nitrate, and denitrification is the anaerobic microbial 
reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas (N2). Nitrous oxide is a gaseous intermediate in the reaction sequence of 
denitrification and a by-product of nitrification that leaks from microbial cells into the soil and ultimately into 
the atmosphere. One of the main controlling factors in this reaction is the availability of inorganic N in the soil. 
This methodology, therefore, estimates N2O emissions using human-induced net N additions to soils (e.g., 
synthetic or organic fertilisers, deposited manure, crop residues, sewage sludge), or of mineralisation of N in soil 
organic matter following drainage/management of organic soils, or cultivation/land-use change on mineral soils 
(e.g., Forest Land/Grassland/Settlements converted to Cropland). 
The emissions of N2O that result from anthropogenic N inputs or N mineralisation occur through both a direct 
pathway (i.e., directly from the soils to which the N is added/released), and through two indirect pathways: (i) 
 
1 Managed land is defined in Chapter 1, Section 1.1. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
11.6 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
following volatilisation of NH3 and NOx from managed soils and from fossil fuel combustion and biomass 
burning, and the subsequent redeposition of these gases and their products NH4+ and NO3- to soils and waters; 
and (ii) after leaching and runoff of N, mainly as NO3-, from managed soils. The principal pathways are 
illustrated in Figure 11.1. 
Direct emissions of N2O from managed soils are estimated separately from indirect emissions, though using a 
common set of activity data. The Tier 1 methodologies do not take into account different land cover, soil type, 
climatic conditions or management practices (other than specified above). Neither do they take account of any 
lag time for direct emissions from crop residues N, and allocate these emissions to the year in which the residues 
are returned to the soil. These factors are not considered for direct or (where appropriate, indirect) emissions 
because limited data are available to provide appropriate emission factors. Countries that have data to show that 
default factors are inappropriate for their country should utilise Tier 2 equations or Tier 3 approaches and include 
a full explanation for the values used. 
11.2.1 
Direct N2O emissions 
In most soils, an increase in available N enhances nitrification and denitrification rates which then increase the 
production of N2O. Increases in available N can occur through human-induced N additions or change of land-use 
and/or management practices that mineralise soil organic N. 
The following N sources are included in the methodology for estimating direct N2O emissions from managed 
soils: 
• 
synthetic N fertilisers (FSN); 
• 
organic N applied as fertiliser (e.g., animal manure, compost, sewage sludge, rendering waste) (FON); 
• 
urine and dung N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing animals (FPRP); 
• 
N in crop residues (above-ground and below-ground), including from N-fixing crops 2 and from forages 
during pasture renewal 3 (FCR); 
• 
N mineralisation associated with loss of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or 
management of mineral soils (FSOM); and 
• 
drainage/management of organic soils (i.e., Histosols) 4 (FOS). 
11.2.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The decision tree in Figure 11.2 provides guidance on which tier method to use. 
Tier 1 
In its most basic form, direct N2O emissions from managed soils are estimated using Equation 11.1 as follows: 
 
 
2 Biological nitrogen fixation has been removed as a direct source of N2O because of the lack of evidence of significant 
emissions arising from the fixation process itself (Rochette and Janzen, 2005). These authors concluded that the N2O 
emissions induced by the growth of legume crops/forages may be estimated solely as a function of the above-ground and 
below-ground nitrogen inputs from crop/forage residue (the nitrogen residue from forages is only accounted for during 
pasture renewal).  Conversely, the release of N by mineralisation of soil organic matter as a result of change of land use or 
management is now included as an additional source.  These are significant adjustments to the methodology previously 
described in the 1996 IPCC Guidelines. 
3 The nitrogen residue from perennial forage crops is only accounted for during periodic pasture renewal, i.e. not necessarily 
on an annual basis as is the case with annual crops. 
4 Soils are organic if they satisfy the requirements 1 and 2, or 1 and 3 below (FAO, 1998): 1. Thickness of 10 cm or more. A 
horizon less than 20 cm thick must have 12 percent or more organic carbon when mixed to a depth of 20 cm; 2. If the soil 
is never saturated with water for more than a few days, and contains more than 20 percent (by weight) organic carbon 
(about 35 percent organic matter); 3. If the soil is subject to water saturation episodes and has either: (i) at least 12 percent 
(by weight) organic carbon (about 20 percent organic matter) if it has no clay; or (ii) at least 18 percent (by weight) organic 
carbon (about 30 percent organic matter) if it has 60 percent or more clay; or (iii) an intermediate, proportional amount of 
organic carbon for intermediate amounts of clay (FAO, 1998).

5 When the total annual quantity of N applied to flooded paddy rice is known, this N input may be multiplied by a lower 
default emission factor applicable to this crop, EF1FR (Table 11.1) (Akiyama et al., 2005) or, where a country-specific 
emission factor has been determined, by that factor instead.  Although there is some evidence that intermittent flooding (as 
described in Chapter 5.5) can increase N2O emissions, current scientific data indicate that EF1FR also applies to intermittent 
flooding situations.

Equation 11.2 may be modified in a variety of ways to accommodate any combination of N source-, crop type-, 
management-, land use-, climate-, soil- or other condition-specific emission factors that a country may be able to 
obtain for each of the individual N input variables (FSN, FON, FCR, FSOM, FOS, FPRP).

N2O = N2O–N ● 44/28 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methods are modelling or measurement approaches. Models are useful because in appropriate forms they 
can relate the soil and environmental variables responsible for N2O emissions to the size of those emissions. 
These relationships may then be used to predict emissions from whole countries or regions for which 
experimental measurements are impracticable. Models should only be used after validation by representative 
experimental measurements. Care should also be taken to ensure that the emission estimates developed through 
the use of models or measurements account for all anthropogenic N2O emissions.7 Guidance that provides a 
sound scientific basis for the development of a Tier 3 Model-based Accounting System is given in Chapter 2, 
Section 2.5. 
11.2.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tiers 1 and 2 
Three emission factors (EF) are needed to estimate direct N2O emissions from managed soils. The default values 
presented here may be used in the Tier 1 equation or in the Tier 2 equation in combination with country-specific 
emission factors. The first EF (EF1) refers to the amount of N2O emitted from the various synthetic and organic 
N applications to soils, including crop residue and mineralisation of soil organic carbon in mineral soils due to 
land-use change or management. The second EF (EF2) refers to the amount of N2O emitted from an area of 
drained/managed organic soils, and the third EF (EF3PRP) estimates the amount of N2O emitted from urine and 
dung N deposited by grazing animals on pasture, range and paddock. Default emission factors for the Tier 1 
method are summarised in Table 11.1. 
 
6 It is important to note that Equation 11.2 is just one of many possible modifications to Equation 11.1 when using the Tier 2 
method.  The eventual form of Equation 11.2 will depend upon the availability of condition-specific emission factors and 
the ability to which a country can disaggregate its activity data. 
7 Natural N2O emissions on managed land are assumed to be equal to emissions on unmanaged land. These latter emissions 
are very low. Therefore, nearly all emissions on managed land are considered anthropogenic. Estimates using the IPCC 
methodology are of the same magnitude as total measured emissions from managed land.  The so-called 'background' 
emissions estimated by Bouwman (1996) (i.e., approx. 1 kg N2O–N/ha/yr under zero fertiliser N addition) are not “natural” 
emissions but are mostly due to contributions of N from crop residue. These emissions are anthropogenic and accounted 
for in the IPCC methodology.   
Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
11.11 
In the light of new evidence, the default value for EF1 has been set at 1% of the N applied to soils or released 
through activities that result in mineralisation of organic matter in mineral soils 8. In many cases, this factor will 
be adequate, however, there are recent data to suggest that this emission factor could be disaggregated based on 
(1) environmental factors (climate, soil organic C content, soil texture, drainage and soil pH); and (2) 
management-related factors (N application rate per fertiliser type, type of crop, with differences between 
legumes, non-leguminous arable crops, and grass) (Bouwman et al., 2002; Stehfest and Bouwman, 2006). 
Countries that are able to disaggregate their activity data from all or some of these factors may choose to use 
disaggregated emission factors with the Tier 2 approach.

The default value for EF2 is 8 kg N2O–N ha-1 yr-1 for temperate climates. Because mineralisation rates are 
assumed to be about 2 times greater in tropical climates than in temperate climates, the emission factor EF2 is 16 
kg N2O–N ha-1 yr-1 for tropical climates 9. Climate definitions are given in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5. 
The default value for EF3PRP is 2% of the N deposited by all animal types except ‘sheep’ and ‘other’ animals. For 
these latter species, a default emission factor of 1% of the N deposited may be used 10. 
 
8 The value of EF1 has been changed from 1.25% to 1%, as compared to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, as a result of new 
analyses of the available experimental data (Bouwman et al., 2002a,b; Stehfest and Bouwman, 2006; Novoa and Tejeda, 
2006 in press). These analyses draw on a much larger number of measurements than were available for the earlier study 
that gave rise to the previous value used for EF1 (Bouwman, 1996). The mean value for fertiliser- and manure-induced 
emissions calculated in these reviews is close to 0.9%; however, it is considered that, given the uncertainties associated 
with this value and the inclusion in the inventory calculation of other contributions to the nitrogen additions (e.g., from 
crop residues and the mineralisation of soil organic matter), the round value of 1% is appropriate. 
9 The values of EF2, for both temperate and tropical climates, have been changed from the values provided in the 1996 IPCC 
Guidelines to those contained in the GPG2000. 
10 The addition of a default emission factor for sheep is a change from the 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The default emission factor 
value for EF3PRP has been disaggregated for different animal types based on a recent review on N2O emissions from urine 
and dung depositions (de Klein, 2004). This review indicated that the emission factor for sheep is lower than that for cattle 
and that a value of 1% of the nitrogen deposited is more appropriate. Reasons for the lower EF3PRP for sheep include more 
even urine distribution (smaller and more frequent urinations), and smaller effects on soil compaction during grazing.  
There are no or very limited data for N2O emission factors of other animal types, and the emission factor for poultry and

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Tiers 1 and 2 
This section describes generic methods for estimating the amount of various N inputs to soils (FSN, FON, FPRP, 
FCR, FSOM, FOS) that are needed for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methodologies (Equations 11.1 and 11.2). 
Applied synthetic fertiliser (FSN) 
The term FSN refers to the annual amount of synthetic N fertiliser applied to soils 11. It is estimated from the total 
amount of synthetic fertiliser consumed annually. Annual fertiliser consumption data may be collected from 
official country statistics, often recorded as fertiliser sales and/or as domestic production and imports. If country-
specific data are not available, data from the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFIA) 
(http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/statistics.asp) on total fertiliser use by type and by crop, or from the Food and 
Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO): (http://faostat.fao.org/) on synthetic fertiliser 
consumption, can be used. It may be useful to compare national statistics to international databases such as those 
of the IFIA and FAO. If sufficient data are available, fertiliser use may be disaggregated by fertiliser type, crop 
type and climatic regime for major crops. These data may be useful in developing revised emission estimates if 
inventory methods are improved in the future. It should be noted that most data sources (including FAO) might 
limit reporting to agricultural N uses, although applications may also occur on Forest Land, Settlements, or other 
lands. This unaccounted N is likely to account for a small proportion of the overall emissions. However, it is 
recommended that countries seek out this additional information whenever possible. 
Applied organic N fertilisers (FON) 
The term “applied organic N fertiliser” (FON) refers to the amount of organic N inputs applied to soils other than 
by grazing animals and is calculated using Equation 11.3. This includes applied animal manure, sewage sludge 
applied to soil, compost applied to soils, as well as other organic amendments of regional importance to 
agriculture (e.g., rendering waste, guano, brewery waste, etc.). Organic N fertiliser (FON) is calculated using 
Equation 11.3:

FSEW = annual amount of total sewage N (coordinate with Waste Sector to ensure that sewage N is not 
double-counted) that is applied to soils, kg N yr-1 
FCOMP = annual amount of total compost N applied to soils (ensure that manure N in compost is not 
double-counted), kg N yr-1 
FOOA = annual amount of other organic amendments used as fertiliser (e.g., rendering waste, guano, 
brewery waste, etc.), kg N yr-1 
 
swine remains at 2% of nitrogen deposited. However, a value of 1% of the nitrogen deposited may be used for animals 
classified as ‘other animals’ which includes goats, horses, mules, donkeys, camels, reindeer, and camelids, as these are 
likely to have nitrogen excretion rates and patterns that are more similar to sheep than to cattle. The review further 
suggested that a disaggregation of EF3PRP for dung vs. urine nitrogen could also be considered. However, this is difficult to 
implement as it is unlikely that countries have the required information readily available to assess excretion rates in urine 
and dung. However, this approach may be considered by countries that use a higher tier methodology. Finally, the review 
revealed that current information is insufficient or inconclusive to allow for disaggregation of EF3PRP based on climate 
region, soil type or drainage class, and/or grazing intensity. 
11 For the Tier 1 approach, the amounts of applied mineral nitrogen fertilisers (FSN) and of applied organic nitrogen fertilisers 
(FON) are no longer adjusted for the amounts of NH3 and NOx volatilisation after application to soil.  This is a change from 
the methodology described in the 1996 IPCC Guidelines. The reason for this change is that field studies that have 
determined N2O emission factors for applied N were not adjusted for volatilisation when they were estimated. In other 
words, these emission factors were determined from: fertiliser-induced N2O–N emitted / total amount of N applied, and not 
from: fertiliser-induced N2O–N emitted / (total amount of N applied – NH3 and NOx volatilised). As a result, adjusting the 
amount of N input for volatilisation before multiplying it with the emission factor would in fact underestimate total N2O 
emissions. Countries using Tier 2 or Tier 3 approaches should be aware that correction for NH3/NOx volatilisation after 
mineral or organic N application to soil may be required depending on the emission factor and/or the inventory 
methodology used.

The term FAM is determined by adjusting the amount of manure N available (NMMS_Avb; see Equation 10.34 in 
Chapter 10) for the amount of managed manure used for feed (FracFEED), burned for fuel (FracFUEL), or used for 
construction (FracCNST) as shown in Equation 11.4. Data for FracFUEL, FracFEED, FracCNST can be obtained from 
official statistics or a survey of experts. However, if these data are not available use NMMS_Avb as FAM without 
adjusting for FracFUEL, FracFEED, FracCNST.

FracCNST = fraction of managed manure used for construction 
 
Urine and dung from grazing animals (FPRP) 
The term FPRP refers to the annual amount of N deposited on pasture, range and paddock soils by grazing animals. 
It is important to note that the N from managed animal manure applied to soils is included in the FAM term of FON. 
The term FPRP is estimated using Equation 11.5 from the number of animals in each livestock species/category T 
(N(T)), the annual average amount of N excreted by each livestock species/category T (Nex(T)), and the fraction of 
this N deposited on pasture, range and paddock soils by each livestock species/category T (MS(T,PRP)). The data 
needed for this equation can be obtained from the livestock chapter (see Chapter 10, Section 10.5). 
Equation 11.5 provides an estimate of the amount of N deposited by grazing animals:

Chapter 10, Section 10.5) 
MS(T,PRP)  = fraction of total annual N excretion for each livestock species/category T that is deposited on 
pasture, range and paddock12 (see Chapter 10, Section 10.5) 
Crop residue N, including N-fixing crops and forage/ pasture renewal, returned to soils, (FCR) 
The term FCR refers to the amount of N in crop residues (above-ground and below-ground), including N-fixing 
crops, returned to soils annually 13. It also includes the N from N-fixing and non-N-fixing forages mineralised 
 
12 In the livestock section, pasture, range and paddock is referred to as one of the manure management systems denoted as 
“S”. 
13 The equation to estimate FCR has been modified from the previous 1996 IPCC Guidelines to account for the contribution of 
the below-ground nitrogen to the total input of nitrogen from crop residues, which previously was ignored in the estimate 
of FCR. As a result, FCR now represents a more accurate estimate of the amount of nitrogen input from crop residue, which 
makes it possible to assess the contribution to residue nitrogen arising from the growth of forage legumes such as alfalfa, 
where the harvesting of virtually all the above-ground dry matter results in no significant residue except the root system.

during forage or pasture renewal 14. It is estimated from crop yield statistics and default factors for above-
/below-ground residue:yield ratios and residue N contents. In addition, the method accounts for the effect of 
residue burning or other removal of residues (direct emissions of N2O from residue burning are addressed under 
Chapter 2, Section 2.4. Because different crop types vary in residue:yield ratios, renewal time and N contents, 
separate calculations should be performed for major crop types and then N values from all crop types are 
summed up. At a minimum, it is recommended that crops be segregated into: 1) non-N-fixing grain crops (e.g., 
maize, rice, wheat, barley); 2) N-fixing grains and pulses (e.g., soybean, dry beans, chickpea, lentils); 3) root and 
tuber crops (e.g., potato, sweet potato, cassava); 4) N-fixing forage crops (alfalfa, clover); and 5) other forages 
including perennial grasses and grass/clover pastures. Equation 11.6 provides the equation to estimate N from 
crop residues and forage/pasture renewal, for a Tier 1 approach.

T = crop or forage type 
Data on crop yield statistics (yields and area harvested, by crop) may be obtained from national sources. If such 
data are not available, FAO publishes data on crop production: (http://faostat.fao.org/). 
Since yield statistics for many crops are reported as field-dry or fresh weight, a correction factor can be applied 
to estimate dry matter yields (Crop(T)) where appropriate (Equation 11.7). The proper correction to be used is 
dependent on the standards used in yield reporting, which may vary between countries. Alternatively, the default 
values for dry matter content given in Table 11.2 may be used. 
 
14 The inclusion of nitrogen from forage or pasture renewal is a change from previous 1996 IPCC Guidelines. 
15 This term is included in the equation to account for N release and the subsequent increases in N2O emissions (e.g., van der 
Weerden et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2001), from renewal/cultivation of grazed grass or grass/clover pasture and other 
forage crops.

An improvement on this approach for determining FCR (i.e., Tier 2) would be the use of country-specific data 
rather than the values provided in Table 11.2, as well as country-specific values for the fraction of above-ground 
residue burned. 
Mineralised N resulting from loss of soil organic C stocks in mineral soils through land-use change or 
management practices (FSOM) 16 
The term FSOM refers to the amount of N mineralised from loss in soil organic C in mineral soils through land-
use change or management practices. As explained in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3, land-use change and a variety of 
management practices can have a significant impact on soil organic C storage. Organic C and N are intimately 
linked in soil organic matter. Where soil C is lost through oxidation as a result of land-use or management 
change, this loss will be accompanied by a simultaneous mineralisation of N. Where a loss of soil C occurs, this 
mineralised N is regarded as an additional source of N available for conversion to N2O (Smith and Conen, 2004); 
just as mineral N released from decomposition of crop residues, for example, becomes a source. The same 
default emission factor (EF1) is applied to mineralised N from soil organic matter loss as is used for direct 
emissions resulting from fertiliser and organic N inputs to agricultural land. This is because the ammonium and 
nitrate resulting from soil organic matter mineralisation is of equal value as a substrate for the microorganisms 
producing N2O by nitrification and denitrification, no matter whether the mineral N source is soil organic matter 
loss from land-use or management change, decomposition of crop residues, synthetic fertilisers or organic 
amendments. (Note: the opposite process to mineralisation, whereby inorganic N is sequestered into newly 
formed SOM, is not taken account of in the calculation of the mineralisation N source. This is because of the 
different dynamics of SOM decomposition and formation, and also because reduced tillage in some 
circumstances can increase both SOM and N2O emission.) 
For all situations where soil C losses occur (as calculated in Chapter 2, Equation 2.25) the Tier 1 and 2 methods 
for calculating the release of N by mineralisation are shown below: 
Calculation steps for estimating changes in N supply from mineralisation 
Step 1: Calculate the average annual loss of soil C (∆CMineral, LU) for the area, over the inventory period, using 
Equation 2.25 in Chapter 2. Using the Tier 1 approach, the value for ∆CMineral, LU will have a single value for all 
land-uses and management systems. Using Tier 2, the value for ∆CMineral, LU will be disaggregated by individual 
land-use and/or management systems. 
Step 2: Estimate the N mineralised as a consequence of this loss of soil C (FSOM), using Equation 11.8: 
 
16 The inclusion of the term FSOM is a change from the previous 1996 IPCC Guidelines, which did not include the N from 
mineralisation associated with a loss of soil organic C.

∆CMineral, LU = average annual loss of soil carbon for each land-use type (LU ), tonnes C (Note: for 
Approach 1, ∆Cmineral, LU will have a single value for all land-uses and management systems. Using 
Approaches 2 or 3 the value for ∆Cmineral, LU will be disaggregated by individual land-use and/or 
management systems. 
R = C:N ratio of the soil organic matter. A default value of 15 (uncertainty range from 10 to 30) for the 
C:N ratio (R) may be used for situations involving land-use change from Forest Land or Grassland 
to Cropland, in the absence of more specific data for the area. A default value of 10 (range from 8 to 
15) may be used for situations involving management changes on Cropland Remaining Cropland. 
C:N ratio can change over time, land use, or management practice 17. If countries can document 
changes in C:N ratio, then different values can be used over the time series, land use, or management 
practice. 
LU = land-use and/or management system type 
Step 3: For Approach 1, the value for FSOM is calculated in a single step. For Approaches 2 or 3, FSOM is 
calculated by summing across all land-uses and/or management system types (LU). 
Countries that are not able to estimate gross changes of mineral soil C will create a bias in the N2O estimate, and 
it is good practice to acknowledge this limitation in the reporting documentation. It is also good practice to use 
specific data for the C:N ratios for the disaggregated land areas, if these are available, in conjunction with the 
data for carbon changes. 
Area of drained/managed organic soils (FOS) 
The term FOS refers to the total annual area (ha) of drained/managed organic soils (see footnote 4 for definition). 
This definition is applicable for both the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods. For all land uses, the areas should be 
stratified by climate zone (temperate and tropical). In addition, for temperate Forest Land the areas should be 
further stratified by soil fertility (nutrient rich and nutrient poor). The area of drained/managed organic soils 
(FOS) may be collected from official national statistics. Alternatively, total areas of organic soils from each 
country are available from FAO (http://faostat.fao.org/), and expert advice may be used to estimate areas that are 
drained/managed. For Forest Land, national data will be available at soil survey organisations and from wetland 
surveys, e.g., for international conventions. In case no stratification by soil fertility is possible, countries may 
rely on expert judgment. 
11.2.1.4 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Uncertainties in estimates of direct N2O emissions from managed soils are caused by uncertainties related to the 
emission factors (see Table 11.1 for uncertainty ranges), natural variability, partitioning fractions, activity data, 
lack of coverage of measurements, spatial aggregation, and lack of information on specific on-farm practices. 
Additional uncertainty will be introduced in an inventory when emission measurements that are not 
representative of all conditions in a country are used. In general, the reliability of activity data will be higher than 
that of the emission factors. As an example, further uncertainties may be caused by missing information on 
observance of laws and regulations related to handling and application of fertiliser and manure, and changing 
management practices in farming. Generally, it is difficult to obtain information on the actual observance of laws 
and possible emission reductions achieved as well as information on farming practices. For more detailed 
guidance on uncertainty assessment refer to Volume 1, Chapter 3.

 Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
11.19 
11.2.2 
Indirect N2O emissions 
In addition to the direct emissions of N2O from managed soils that occur through a direct pathway (i.e., directly 
from the soils to which N is applied), emissions of N2O also take place through two indirect pathways (as 
illustrated above in Section 11.2). 
The first of these pathways is the volatilisation of N as NH3 and oxides of N (NOx), and the deposition of these 
gases and their products NH4+ and NO3- onto soils and the surface of lakes and other waters. The sources of N as 
NH3 and NOx are not confined to agricultural fertilisers and manures, but also include fossil fuel combustion, 
biomass burning, and processes in the chemical industry (see Volume 1, Chapter 7, Section 7.3). Thus, these 
processes cause N2O emissions in an exactly analogous way to those resulting from deposition of agriculturally 
derived NH3 and NOx, following the application of synthetic and organic N fertilisers and /or urine and dung 
deposition from grazing animals. The second pathway is the leaching and runoff from land of N from synthetic 
and organic fertiliser additions, crop residues 18, mineralisation of N associated with loss of soil C in mineral and 
drained/managed organic soils through land-use change or management practices, and urine and dung deposition 
from grazing animals. Some of the inorganic N in or on the soil, mainly in the NO3- form, may bypass biological 
retention mechanisms in the soil/vegetation system by transport in overland water flow (runoff) and/or flow 
through soil macropores or pipe drains. Where NO3- is present in the soil in excess of biological demand, e.g., 
under cattle urine patches, the excess leaches through the soil profile. The nitrification and denitrification 
processes described at the beginning of this chapter transform some of the NH4+ and NO3- to N2O. This may take 
place in the groundwater below the land to which the N was applied, or in riparian zones receiving drain or 
runoff water, or in the ditches, streams, rivers and estuaries (and their sediments) into which the land drainage 
water eventually flows. 
This methodology described in this Chapter addresses the following N sources of indirect N2O emissions from 
managed soils arising from agricultural inputs of N: 
• 
synthetic N fertilisers (FSN); 
• 
organic N applied as fertiliser (e.g., applied animal manure 19, compost, sewage sludge, rendering waste and 
other organic amendments) (FON); 
• 
urine and dung N deposited on pasture, range and paddock by grazing animals (FPRP); 
• 
N in crop residues (above- and below-ground), including N-fixing crops and forage/pasture renewal returned 
to soils (FCR) 20; and 
• 
N mineralisation associated with loss of soil organic matter resulting from change of land use or 
management on mineral soils (FSOM) 20. 
The generic Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods described below can be used to estimate aggregate total indirect N2O 
emissions from agricultural N additions to managed soils for an entire country. If a country is estimating its 
direct N2O from managed soils by land-use category, the indirect N2O emissions can also be estimated by the 
same disaggregation of land-use categories using the equations presented below with activity data, partitioning 
fractions, and/or emission factors specific for each land-use category. The methodology for estimating indirect 
N2O emissions from combustion-related and industrial sources is described in Volume 1, Chapter 7, Section 7.3. 
11.2.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Refer to the decision tree in Figure 11.3 (Indirect N2O Emissions) for guidance on which Tier method to use. 
 
 
18 The inclusion of crop residues as an N input into the leaching and runoff component is a change from the previous IPCC 
Guidelines. 
19 Volatilisation and subsequent deposition of nitrogen from the manure in manure management systems is covered in the 
manure management section of this Volume.  
20 Nitrogen from these components is only included in the leaching/run-off component of indirect N2O emission.

Tier 3 
Tier 3 methods are modelling or measurement approaches. Models are useful as they can relate the variables 
responsible for the emissions to the size of those emissions. These relationships may then be used to predict 
emissions from whole countries or regions for which experimental measurements are impracticable. For more 
information refer to Chapter 2, Section 2.5, where guidance is given that provides a sound scientific basis for the 
development of a Tier 3 Model-based Accounting System. 
 
21 It is important to note that Equation 11.11 is just one of many possible modifications to Equation 11.9, and is also meant to 
illustrate how Equation 11.10 could be modified, when using the Tier 2 method.  The eventual form of Equation 11.11 will 
depend upon the availability of  land use and/or condition-specific partitioning fractions and/or emission factors and the 
ability to which a country can disaggregate its activity data. 
 Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
11.23 
11.2.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION, VOLATILISATION AND LEACHING 
FACTORS 
The method for estimating indirect N2O emissions includes two emission factors: one associated with volatilised 
and re-deposited N (EF4), and the second associated with N lost through leaching/runoff (EF5). The method also 
requires values for the fractions of N that are lost through volatilisation (FracGASF and FracGASM) or 
leaching/runoff (FracLEACH-(H)). The default values of all these factors are presented in Table 11.3. 
Note that in the Tier 1 method, for humid regions or in dryland regions where irrigation (other than drip 
irrigation) is used, the default FracLEACH-(H) is 0.30. For dryland regions, where precipitation is lower than 
evapotranspiration throughout most of the year and leaching is unlikely to occur, the default FracLEACH is zero. 
The method of calculating whether FracLEACH-(H) = 0.30 should be applied is given in Table 11.3. 
Country-specific values for EF4 should be used with great caution because of the special complexity of 
transboundary atmospheric transport. Although inventory compilers may have specific measurements of N 
deposition and associated N2O flux, in many cases the deposited N may not have originated in their country. 
Similarly, some of the N that volatilises in their country may be transported to and deposited in another country, 
where different conditions that affect the fraction emitted as N2O may prevail. For these reasons the value of EF4 
is very difficult to determine, and the method presented in Volume 1, Chapter 7, Section 7.3 attributes all 
indirect N2O emissions resulting from inputs to managed soils to the country of origin of the atmospheric NOx 
and NH3, rather than the country to which the atmospheric N may have been transported. 
11.2.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
In order to estimate indirect N2O emissions from the various N additions to managed soils, the parameters FSN, 
FON, FPRP, FCR, FSOM need to be estimated. 
Applied synthetic fertiliser (FSN) 
The term FSN refers to the annual amount of synthetic fertiliser N applied to soils. Refer to the activity data 
section on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FSN. 
Applied organic N fertilisers (FON) 
The term FON refers to the amount of organic N fertiliser materials intentionally applied to soils. Refer to the 
activity data section on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FON. 
Urine and dung from grazing animals (FPRP) 
The term FPRP refers to the amount of N deposited on soil by animals grazing on pasture, range and paddock. 
Refer to the activity data section on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the 
value for FPRP. 
Crop residue N, including N from N-fixing crops and forage/pasture renewal, returned to soils (FCR) 
The term FCR refers to the amount of N in crop residues (above- and below-ground), including N-fixing crops, 
returned to soils annually. It also includes the N from N-fixing and non-N-fixing forages mineralised during 
forage/pasture renewal. Refer to the activity data section on direct N2O emissions from managed soils (Section 
11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FCR. 
Mineralised N resulting from loss of soil organic C stocks in mineral soils (FSOM) 
The term FSOM refers to the amount of N mineralised from the loss of soil organic C in mineral soils through 
land-use change or management practices. Refer to the activity data section on direct N2O emissions from 
managed soils (Section 11.2.1.3) and obtain the value for FSOM.

capacity is exceeded, as a result of rainfall and/or irrigation (excluding drip irrigation), and leaching/runoff occurs, and 
redesignated as FracLEACH-(H). In the definition of FracLEACH-(H) above, PE is potential evaporation, and the rainy season(s) can 
be taken as the period(s) when rainfall > 0.5 * Pan Evaporation. (Explanations of potential and pan evaporation are available 
in standard meteorological and agricultural texts). For other regions the default FracLEACH is taken as zero. 
 
11.2.2.4 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Uncertainties in estimates of indirect N2O emissions from managed soils are caused by uncertainties related to 
natural variability and to the emission, volatilization and leaching factors (see Table 11.3 for uncertainty ranges), 
activity data, and lack of measurements. Additional uncertainty will be introduced in an inventory when values 
for these factors that are not representative of all conditions in a country are used. In general, the reliability of 
activity data will be higher than that of the emission, volatilisation and leaching factors. As with direct emissions, 
further uncertainties may be caused by missing information on observance of laws and regulations related to 
handling and application of fertiliser and manure, and changing management practices in farming. Generally, it 
is difficult to obtain information on the actual observance of laws and possible emission reductions achieved as 
well as information on farming practices. Uncertainties in emission factors are nevertheless likely to dominate 
and uncertainty ranges are indicated in the tabulations above. For more detailed guidance on uncertainty 
assessment refer to Volume 1, Chapter 3. 
 
22 The uncertainty range has been widened, in view of results showing that emissions from some environments, particularly 
deciduous forests receiving high rates of N deposition from the atmosphere, are substantially higher than those previously 
reported (e.g., Butterbach-Bahl et al., 1997; Brumme et al., 1999; Denier van der Gon and Bleeker, 2005)., while there is 
also clear evidence that EFs can be very low (<< 0.01) in low-deposition environments (e.g., Corre et al., 1999). The mean 
value of 0.01 has been retained, because it coincides with the revised EF for direct emission from managed land (see Table 
11.1 above), and it is recognised that in many countries a substantial fraction of the indirect emissions will in fact originate 
from managed land. 
23 The overall value for the emission factor for leached N (EF5) has been changed from 0.025 to 0.0075 kg N2O–N/kg N 
leached/ in runoff water. This emission factor incorporates three components: EF5g, EF5r and EF5e, which are the emission 
factors for groundwater and surface drainage, rivers, and estuaries, respectively. Recent results indicate that the previously 
used emission factor for groundwater and surface drainage (0.015) was too high and should be reduced to 0.0025 kg N2O–
N/kg mineral N (mainly nitrate) leached (Hiscock et al., 2002, 2003; Reay et al., 2004, 2005; Sawamoto et al., 2005). The 
emission factor for rivers has also been reduced from 0.0075 kg N2O–N/kg N to the same value, 0.0025 kg N2O–N/kg N in 
the water. This is in recognition that while still lower mean values (of the order of 0.0003 to 0.0005) have been reported by, 
e.g., Dong et al., (2004) and Clough et al , (2006) for relatively short river systems, there remains the possibility that higher 
values than those obtained by these authors apply to longer river systems. The value for estuaries remains at 0.0025 kg 
N2O–N/kg N.

11.2.3 
Completeness, Time series, QA/QC 
COMPLETENESS 
Complete coverage of the direct and indirect N2O emissions from managed land requires estimation of emissions 
for all of the anthropogenic inputs and activities (FSN, FON, FCR, FPRP, FSOM and FOS), if they occur. Experience 
has shown that none of these sub-categories are likely to be missed in inventories, although countries may have 
difficulty obtaining accurate statistics for all sub-categories, particularly the amounts of crop residues (by crop 
type) that are typically returned to soils, and the area of drained/managed organic soils. 
Currently, the IPCC method does not explicitly address activities such as plastic sheeting or greenhouse 
hydroponic systems that may influence N2O emissions. These additional activities can be considered if 
appropriate, and if national activity data for these activities are collected. Some of these activities can be readily 
included in national inventories based on available information. For the additional commercial and non-
commercial organic fertilisers, the default emission factor used for applied N may be used. Further research will 
be required to develop the flux data that are needed to develop emission factors for use of plastic sheeting and 
hydroponic systems in horticultural areas. 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Ideally, the same method is used throughout the entire time series. However, it is likely that the detail and 
disaggregation of emissions estimates from this source category will improve over time. In cases where some 
historical data are missing, it may be necessary to derive the data using other references or data sets. For example, 
annual data of areas for drained/managed organic soils may need to be derived by interpolation from a longer 
time series based upon long-term trends (e.g., from decadal statistics over a 20- or 30-year period). Estimates of 
the amounts of crop residue incorporated annually may also need to be derived based on expert judgment. 
Interannual changes in FracGASF, FracGASM, FracLEACH, EF4, and EF5 are not expected unless mitigation measures 
are undertaken. These factors should be changed only with the proper justification and documentation. If updated 
defaults for any of these variables become available through future research, inventory agencies may recalculate 
their historical emissions. 
It is important that the methods used reflect the results of action taken to reduce emissions and the methods and 
results are thoroughly documented. If policy measures are implemented such that activity data are affected 
directly (e.g., increased efficiency of fertiliser use resulting in a decrease in fertiliser consumption), the effect of 
the policy measures on emissions will be transparent, assuming the activity data are carefully documented. In 
cases where policy measures have an indirect effect on activity data or emission factors (e.g., a change in animal 
population feed practices to improve animal productivity that results in a change in N excretion per head), 
inventory input data should reflect these effects. The inventory text should thoroughly explain the effect of the 
policies on the input data. 
INVENTORY QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
Tier 1 checks of the emission estimates should be undertaken by the persons preparing the inventory along with 
expert review by people outside the inventory preparation process. Additional Tier 2 quality control checks and 
quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine 
direct and indirect N2O emissions from this source category. Supplement the general QA/QC related to data 
processing, handling, and reporting, with source-specific category procedures discussed below. The persons who 
collect data are responsible for reviewing the data collection methods, checking the data to ensure that they are 
collected and aggregated or disaggregated correctly, and cross-checking the data with previous years to ensure 
that the data are reasonable. The basis for the estimates, whether statistical surveys or ‘desk estimates’, must be 
reviewed and described as part of the QC effort. Documentation is a crucial component of the review process 
because it enables reviewers to identify mistakes and suggest improvements. 
Review of emission factors 
The inventory compiler should review the default emission factors and document the rationale for selecting 
specific values. 
If using country-specific factors, the inventory compiler should compare them to the IPCC default emission 
factors. Also, if accessible, relate to country-specific emission factors used by other countries with comparable 
circumstances. Differences between country-specific factors and default or other country factors should be 
explained and documented. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
11.26 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Review of any direct measurements 
If using factors based on direct measurements, the inventory compiler should review the measurements to ensure 
that they are representative of the actual range of environmental and soil management conditions, and inter-
annual climatic variability, and were developed according to recognised standards (IAEA, 1992). 
The QA/QC protocol in effect at the sites should also be reviewed and the resulting estimates compared between 
sites and with default-based estimates. 
Activity data check 
The inventory compiler should compare country-specific data on synthetic fertiliser consumption with fertiliser 
usage data from the IFA and synthetic fertiliser consumption estimates from the FAO. 
The inventory compiler should ensure that N excretion data are consistent with those used for the manure 
management systems source category. 
National crop production statistics should be compared to FAO crop production statistics. 
The inventory compiler should ensure that the QA/QC has been completed for livestock characterisation, 
because data are shared with the livestock section. 
Country-specific values for various parameters should be compared to IPCC defaults and any significant 
differences explained. 
External review 
The inventory compiler should conduct expert (peer) review when first adopting or revising the method. Given 
the complexity and uniqueness of the parameters used in calculating country-specific factors for these categories, 
specialists in the field should be involved in such reviews. 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
Direct and Indirect N2O Emissions 
Document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory estimates. Direct and 
indirect N2O emissions from managed soils are reported in aggregate or disaggregated by land-use category or 
other subcategory (e.g., ricelands) under the IPCC category ‘AFOLU’. Reporting should be done at the same 
level of disaggregation as was done when calculating the emissions. In addition to completing the reporting 
formats, the following additional information is necessary to document the estimate: 
Activity data: Sources of all activity data used in the calculations (i.e., complete citations for the statistical 
databases from which data were collected), and in cases when activity data were not available directly from 
databases, the information and assumptions that were used to derive the activity data. This documentation should 
include the frequency of data collection and estimation, and estimates of accuracy and precision. 
Emission factors: The sources of the emission factors that were used (specific IPCC default values or otherwise). 
In inventories in which country- or region-specific emission factors were used, or in which new methods (other 
than the default IPCC methods) were used, the scientific basis of these emission factors and methods should be 
completely described and documented. This includes defining the input parameters and describing the process by 
which these emission factors and methods are derived, as well as describing sources and magnitudes of 
uncertainties. 
Emission results: Significant fluctuations in emissions between years should be explained. A distinction should 
be made between changes in activity levels and changes in emission, volatilisation and leaching factors from 
year to year, and the reasons for these changes documented. If different factors are used for different years, the 
reasons for this should be explained and documented. 
11.3 
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM LIMING 
Liming is used to reduce soil acidity and improve plant growth in managed systems, particularly agricultural 
lands and managed forests. Adding carbonates to soils in the form of lime (e.g., calcic limestone (CaCO3), or 
dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2) leads to CO2 emissions as the carbonate limes dissolve and release bicarbonate (2HCO3-
), which evolves into CO2 and water (H2O). 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches, with each successive Tier requiring more detail 
and resources than the previous one. It is good practice for countries to use higher tiers if CO2 emissions from 
liming are a key source category.

Choice of method 
A decision tree is provided in Figure 11.4 to assist inventory compilers with selection of the appropriate tier. 
Tier 1 
CO2 Emissions from additions of carbonate limes to soils can be estimated with Equation 11.12:

Where: 
CO2–C Emission = annual C emissions from lime application, tonnes C yr-1 
M = annual amount of calcic limestone (CaCO3) or dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2), tonnes yr-1 
EF = emission factor, tonne of C (tonne of limestone or dolomite) -1 
 
Procedural steps for calculations 
The steps for estimating CO2-C emissions from liming are: 
Step 1: Estimate the total amount (M) of carbonate containing lime applied annually to soils in the country, 
differentiating between limestone and dolomite (Note: M should include all lime applied to soils even the 
proportion applied in mixture with fertilizers). Note that while carbonate limes are the dominant liming material 
used in managed systems, oxides (e.g., CaO) and hydroxides of lime are used to a limited extent for soil liming. 
These materials do not contain inorganic carbon and are not included in calculations for estimating CO2 
emissions from application to soils (CO2 is produced in their manufacture but not following soil application). 
Step 2: Apply an overall emission factor (EF) of 0.12 for limestone and 0.13 for dolomite. These are equivalent 
to carbonate carbon contents of the materials (12% for CaCO3, 13% for CaMg(CO3)2 )). The uncertainty is -50% 
based on approximations suggesting emissions may be less than half of the maximum value, which is the current 
factor value (West and McBride, 2005) (Note: uncertainties can not exceed the emission factors because these 
value represent the absolute maximum emissions associated with liming). 
Step 3: Multiply the total amounts of limestone and dolomite by their respective emission factors, and sum the 
two values to obtain the total CO2–C emission. 
Multiply by 44/12 to convert CO2–C emissions into CO2. 
Tier 2 
Tier 2 inventories also use Equation 11.12 and procedural steps, which were provided in the Tier 1 approach, but 
incorporate country-specific data to derive emission factors (EF). 
Overall, the CO2 emissions from liming are expected to be less than using the Tier 1 approach, which assumes 
that all C in applied lime is emitted as CO2 in the year of application. However, emissions are likely to be less 
than assumed using the Tier 1 approach because the amount of CO2 emitted after liming will depend on site-
specific influences and transport of dissolved inorganic C through rivers and lakes to the ocean. Tier 2 emission 
factors could be used to better approximate the emissions. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methods use more sophisticated models or measurement procedures, and the procedural steps will depend 
on the country-specific estimation system. Such an analysis would likely necessitate modelling carbon fluxes 
associated with primary and secondary carbonate mineral formation and dissolution in soils, as well as the 
leaching and transport of dissolved inorganic C. Note that increases in soil inorganic C or dissolved inorganic C 
attributed to liming does not constitute a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Rather, carbonate-C from 
liming that is not returned to the atmosphere is considered a net reduction in the emissions associated with this 
practice. See the Tier 3 section for soil inorganic C in Chapter 2 for additional discussion (Section 2.3.3.1 on 
Change in Soil C Stocks).

11.29 
11.3.2 
Choice of emission factors 
Tier 1 
Default emission factors (EF) are 0.12 for limestone and 0.13 for dolomite. 
Tier 2 
Derivation of emission factors using country-specific data could entail differentiation of sources with variable 
compositions of lime; different carbonate liming materials (limestone as well as other sources such as marl and 
shell deposits) can vary somewhat in their C content and overall purity. Each material would have a unique 
emission factor based on the C content. 
Country-specific emission factors could also account for the proportion of carbonate-C from liming that is 
emitted to the atmosphere as CO2 (e.g., West and McBride, 2005). Dissolved inorganic C in soils can form 
secondary minerals and precipitate with the Ca or Mg that was added during liming. Furthermore, dissolved 
inorganic C (bicarbonate) can be transported with Ca and Mg through the soil to deep groundwater, lakes and 
eventually to the ocean (Robertson and Grace, 2004). In either case, the net emission of CO2 to the atmosphere is 
less than the original amount of C added as lime. Country-specific emission factors can be derived if there are 
sufficient data and understanding of inorganic carbon transformations, in addition to knowledge about transport 
of aqueous Ca, Mg, and inorganic C. It is good practice to document the source of information and method used 
for deriving country-specific values in the reporting process. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches are based on estimating variable emissions from year to year, which depends on a variety of 
site specific characteristics and environmental drivers. No emission factors are directly estimated. 
11.3.3 
Choice of activity data 
Tier 1 
Optimally, national usage statistics for carbonate lime would be available to determine the amount applied 
annually to soils (M). These data provide the most direct inference on application. Alternatively, annual sales of 
carbonate lime may be used to infer the amount that is applied to soils, under the assumption that all lime sold to 
farmers, ranchers, foresters, etc. is applied during that year. It is also possible to approximate carbonate lime 
application based on lime availability on an annual basis. Availability is computed based on the new supply for 
that year (annual domestic mining and import records) minus exports and usage in industrial processes. In the 
last approach, it is assumed that all available lime is applied in the year of interest. 
Usage statistics may be gathered as part of the national census or enterprise records, while banks and the lime 
industry should have information on sales and domestic production. Import/export records are typically 
maintained by customs or similar organizations in the government. It is good practice to average data records 
over three years (current year and two most recent) if emissions are not computed on an annual basis for 
reporting purposes. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the activity data that are described for Tier 1, Tier 2 may incorporate information on the purity of 
carbonate limes as well as site-level and hydrological characteristics to estimate the proportion of carbonate-C in 
lime applications that is emitted to the atmosphere. 
Tier 3 
For Tier 3 model-based and/or direct measurement-based inventories, it is likely that more detailed activity data 
are needed, relative to Tier 1 or 2 methods, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or 
measurement design. 
11.3.4 
Uncertainty assessment 
Two sources of uncertainty exist for CO2 emissions from liming: 1) uncertainties in the amount of carbonate 
lime applied to soils; and 2) uncertainties in the net amount of carbonate-C from liming applications that is 
emitted as CO2. Activity data uncertainties depend on the accuracy of application statistics, sales, import/export 
records, mining records, and/or usage data. Usage data have the least uncertainty because sales, import/export 
and mining records have additional uncertainties due to no direct inference about application. Inventory 
compilers may use a conservative approach and assume that all lime available for application or purchased is 
applied to soils. This approach may over- or under-estimate emissions in individual years if the total amount of 
lime available or purchased is not applied in a particular year. Over the long term, this bias should be negligible, 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
11.30 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
however, assuming there is no long-term stockpiling of lime. Alternatively, inventory compilers can address 
uncertainties in both the amount of lime available for application and the amount applied in a particular 
inventory year. 
Uncertainties in the net amount of C added to soils from liming that is emitted as CO2 are dependent on the Tier. 
Using the Tier 1 method, it is assumed all C in the lime is emitted as CO2 to the atmosphere. This is a 
conservative approach, and the default emission factors are considered certain given this assumption. In practice, 
however, some of the C in lime is likely to be retained in the soil as inorganic C and not emitted as CO2, at least 
in the year of application. Consequently, default emission factors can lead to systematic biases in the emission 
estimates. 
It is good practice, therefore, to develop country-specific emission factors or advanced estimation approaches 
with Tier 2 or 3 methods, particularly if liming is a key source. While the higher tier approaches are likely to 
limit bias, there may be additional uncertainties associated with these approaches that will need to be addressed. 
Those uncertainties can stem from insufficient data on site characteristics, hydrology and other environmental 
variables, which influences the transport and conversion of inorganic C into CO2. There may also be 
uncertainties due to insufficient knowledge about the processes and/or ability of country-specific emission 
factors or advanced estimation systems to represent the fate of C added to soils in carbonate limes. 
11.3.5 
Completeness, Time series, QA/QC 
COMPLETENESS 
Tier 1 
Tier 1 inventories are complete if emissions are computed based on a full accounting of all limestone and 
dolomite applied to soils. Carbonate lime usage statistics provide the most direct inference on applications to 
soils. However, sales records or mining data combined with import/export and industrial processing records 
provide sufficient information to approximate the amount of lime applied to soils. If current data are not 
sufficient due to incomplete records, it is good practice to gather additional data for future inventory reporting, 
particularly if liming C emissions are a key source category. 
Tier 2 
Completeness in Tier 2 inventories is dependent on the adequacy of the activity data (see Tier 1), but will also 
depend on additional country-specific data that were used to refine emission factors. This may include the 
availability of data about the purity of lime and/or site-level and hydrological data to better specify emission 
factors relating the amount of CO2 released per amount of C added to soils in carbonate lime. 
Tier 3 
Beyond the considerations for Tier 1 and 2, completeness of Tier 3 inventories is also dependent on the data 
needs and representativeness of the measurement design and/or modelling framework. Inventory compilers 
should review their approach and determine if the advanced estimation system are adequate to address the net 
release of CO2 from carbonate limes applied to soils. If gaps or limitations are identified, it is good practice to 
gather additional data so that the fate of liming carbonates is fully addressed by the Tier 3 method. 
TIME SERIES CONSISTENCY 
Tier 1 
The same activity data and emissions factors should be applied across the entire time series for consistency. At 
the Tier 1 level, default emission factors are used so consistency is not an issue for this component. However, the 
basis for the activity data may change if new data are gathered, such as a statistical survey compiling information 
on applications to soils versus older activity data relying strictly on mining and import/export records. While it is 
good practice for the same data protocols and procedures to be used across the entire time series, in some cases 
this may not be possible, and inventory compilers should determine the influence of changing data sources on 
the trends. Guidance on recalculation for these circumstances is presented in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
Tier 2 
Consistency in activity data records across the time series is important for Tier 2 inventories (see Tier 1). In 
addition, new factors that are developed based on country-specific data should also be applied across the entire 
time series. In rare cases when this is not possible, inventory compilers should determine the influence of 
changing emission factors on the trends; additional guidance on recalculation for these circumstances can be 
found in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
Tier 3 
Similar to Tier 2, it is good practice to apply the country-specific estimation system throughout the entire time 
series; inventory agencies should use the same measurement protocols (sampling strategy, method, etc.) and/or 
model-based system throughout the inventory time period. 
 Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
11.31 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
Tier 1 
It is good practice to implement Quality Assurance/Quality Controls with internal and independent reviews of 
inventory data and results, ensuring: 1) activity data have been processed appropriately to estimate application to 
soils; 2) activity data have been properly transcribed into the worksheets or inventory computation software; and 
3) emission factors have been assigned appropriately. 
Internal reviews should be conducted by the inventory compiler(s), and may involve visual inspection as well as 
built-in program functions to check data entry and results. Independent reviews are conducted by other agencies, 
experts or groups who are not directly involved with the compilation. These reviews need to consider the validity 
of the inventory approach, thoroughness of inventory documentation, methods explanation and overall 
transparency. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the Quality Assurance/Quality Control measures under Tier 1, the inventory compiler should 
review the country-specific emission factors for Tier 2 inventories. If using factors based on direct 
measurements, the inventory compiler should review the measurements to ensure that they are representative of 
the actual range of environmental conditions. If accessible, it is good practice to compare the country-specific 
factors with Tier 2 emission factors used by other countries with comparable circumstances, in addition to the 
IPCC defaults. Given the complexity of inorganic C transformation, specialists in the field should be involved in 
the review process to provide an independent critique of the emission factors. 
Tier 3 
Country-specific inventory systems will likely need additional Quality Assurance/Quality Control measures, but 
this will be dependent on the systems that are developed. It is good practice to develop a Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control protocol that is specific to the country’s advanced estimation system, archive the 
reports, and include summary results in reporting documentation. 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
Tier 1 
For Tier 1, inventory compilers should document trends and uncertainties in carbon lime applications to soils and 
relate those patterns to the CO2 emission trends. Significant fluctuations in annual emissions across the time 
series should be explained. 
It is good practice to archive actual databases, such as mining records or usage statistics from surveys, and 
procedures used to process the data (e.g., statistical programs). The worksheets or inventory software, which was 
used to estimate emissions, should be archived along with input/output files that were generated to produce the 
results. 
In cases where activity data are not available directly from databases or multiple data sets were combined, the 
information, assumptions and procedures that were used to derive the activity data should be described. This 
documentation should include the frequency of data collection and estimation, and uncertainty. Use of expert 
knowledge should be documented and correspondences archived. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the considerations for Tier 1, inventory compilers should document the underlying basis for 
country-specific emission factors, as well as archive metadata and data sources used to estimate country-specific 
values. Reporting documentation should include the new factors (i.e., means and uncertainties), and it is good 
practice to include a discussion in the inventory report about differences between these values and default 
factors or country-specific factors from regions with similar circumstances to those of the reporting country. 
When discussing trends in emissions and removals from year to year, a distinction should be made between 
changes in activity levels and changes in methods, including emission factors, and the reasons for these changes 
need to be documented. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 inventories need similar documentation about activity data and emission/removal trends as lower tier 
approaches, but additional documentation should be included to explain the underlying basis and framework of 
country-specific estimation systems. With measurement-based inventories, it is good practice to document the 
sampling design, laboratory procedures and data analysis techniques. Measurement data should be archived, 
along with results from data analyses. For Tier 3 approaches using modelling, it is good practice to document the 
model version and provide a model description, as well as permanently archive copies of all model input files, 
source code and executable programs.

CO2 EMISSIONS FROM UREA 
FERTILIZATION 
Adding urea to soils during fertilisation leads to a loss of CO2 that was fixed in the industrial production process. 
Urea (CO(NH2)2) is converted into ammonium (NH4+), hydroxyl ion (OH-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-), in the 
presence of water and urease enzymes. Similar to the soil reaction following addition of lime, bicarbonate that is 
formed evolves into CO2 and water. This source category is included because the CO2 removal from the 
atmosphere during urea manufacturing is estimated in the Industrial Processes and Product Use Sector (IPPU 
Sector). 
Inventories can be developed using Tier 1, 2 or 3 approaches, with each successive Tier requiring more detail 
and resources than the previous. It is good practice for countries to use higher tiers if CO2 emissions from urea 
are a key source category. 
11.4.1 
Choice of method 
A decision tree is provided in Figure 11.5 to assist inventory compilers with selection of the appropriate tier. 
Tier 1 
CO2 emissions from urea fertilisation can be estimated with Equation 11.13:

Where: 
CO2–C Emission = annual C emissions from urea application, tonnes C yr-1 
M = annual amount of urea fertilisation, tonnes urea yr-1 
EF = emission factor, tonne of C (tonne of urea)-1 
 
Procedural Steps for Calculations 
The steps for estimating CO2–C emissions from urea applications are: 
Step 1: Estimate the total amount of urea applied annually to a soil in the country (M). 
Step 2: Apply an overall emission factor (EF) of 0.20 for urea, which is equivalent to the carbon content of urea 
on an atomic weight basis (20% for CO(NH2)2). A default -50% uncertainty may be applied (Note: uncertainties 
can not exceed the default emission factor because this value represents the absolute maximum emissions 
associated with urea fertilization). 
Step 3: Estimate the total CO2–C emission based on the product of the amount of urea applied and the emission 
factor. 
Multiply by 44/12 to convert CO2–C emissions into CO2. Urea is often applied in combination with other 
nitrogenous fertilizers, particularly in solutions, and it will be necessary to estimate the proportion of urea in the 
fertilizer solution for M. If the proportion is not known, it is considered good practice to assume that the entire 
solution is urea, rather than potentially under-estimating emissions for this sub-category. 
Tier 2 
Tier 2 inventories also use Equation 11.13 and procedural steps, which were provided in the Tier 1 approach, but 
incorporate country-specific information to estimate emission factors. 
Tier 3 
CO2 emissions from urea applications could be estimated with more detailed models or measurements that 
incorporate the possibility of bicarbonate leaching to deep groundwater, and/or lakes and oceans, and thus not 
contributing to CO2 emissions, at least not immediately. Note that increases in soil inorganic C from urea 
fertilization do not represent a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The removal is estimated in the IPPU 
Sector (Volume 3), and the computations for soils only provide estimates of the amount of emissions associated 
with this practice. See the Tier 3 section for soil inorganic C in Chapter 2 for additional discussion (Section 2.3.3 
on Change in Soil C Stocks).

11.4.2 
Choice of emission factor 
Tier 1 
The default emission factor (EF) is 0.20 for carbon emissions from urea applications. 
Tier 2 
Similar to carbonate limes, all C in urea may not be emitted in the year of application. If sufficient data and 
understanding of inorganic C transformation are available, country-specific specific emission factor could be 
derived. It is good practice to document the source of information and method used for deriving country-specific 
values as part of the reporting process. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches are based on estimating variable emissions from year to year, which depends on a variety of 
site specific characteristics and environmental drivers. No emission factor is directly estimated. 
11.4.3 
Choice of activity data 
Tier 1 
Domestic production records and import/export data on urea can be used to obtain an approximate estimate of 
the amount of urea applied to soils on an annual basis (M). It can be assumed that all urea fertiliser produced or 
imported annually minus annual exports is applied to soils. However, supplemental data on sales and/or usage of 
urea can be used to refine the calculation, instead of assuming all available urea in a particular year is 
immediately added to soils. Regardless of the approach, the annual application estimates for urea fertilizers 
should be consistent between CO2 emission from urea and N2O emissions from soils. 
Usage statistics may be gathered as part of the national census or through enterprise records, while banks and the 
fertilizer industry should have information on sales and domestic production. Import/export records are typically 
maintained by customs or similar organizations in the government. It is good practice to average data records 
over three years (current year and two most recent) if emissions are not computed on an annual basis for 
reporting purposes. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the activity data described for Tier 1, Tier 2 may incorporate additional information on site-level 
and hydrological characteristics that were used to estimate the proportion of C in urea that is emitted to the 
atmosphere. 
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, it is likely that more 
detailed activity data are needed, relative to Tier 1 or 2 methods, but the exact requirements will be dependent on 
the model or measurement design. 
11.4.4 
Uncertainty assessment 
Two sources of uncertainty exist for CO2 emissions from urea: 1) uncertainties in the amount of urea applied to 
soils; and 2) uncertainties in the net amount of urea-C that is emitted as CO2. Activity data uncertainties will 
depend on the accuracy of production, sales, import/export, and/or usage data. Usage and sales data are likely to 
have the least uncertainty; import/export and production data have additional uncertainties due to inferences 
about application. Inventory compilers may use a conservative approach and assume that all urea available for 
application or purchased is applied to soils. This approach may create over- or under-estimates in individual 
years if the total amount of urea available or purchased is not applied in a particular year. Over the longer-term 
this bias should be negligible, however, assuming there is no long-term stockpiling of urea fertiliser. 
Alternatively, inventory compilers can address uncertainties in both the amount of urea available for application 
and the amount applied in a particular inventory year. 
Uncertainties in the net amount of C added to soils from urea fertilization that is emitted as CO2 are dependent 
on the Tier. Using the Tier 1 method, it is assumed all C in the urea is lost as CO2 from the atmosphere. This is a 
conservative approach, and the default emission factors are considered certain (given this assumption). In 
practice, however, some of the C in urea may be retained in the soil as inorganic C and not emitted as CO2, at 
least in the year of application. Consequently, default emission factors can lead to systematic biases in the 
emission estimates. 
It is good practice, therefore, to develop country-specific emission factors or advanced estimation approaches 
with Tier 2 or 3 methods, respectively, particularly if urea-C is a key source. While the higher tier approaches 
 Chapter 11: N2O Emissions from Managed Soils, and CO2 Emissions from Lime and Urea Application  
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
11.35 
are likely to limit bias, there are additional uncertainties that will need to be addressed. Those uncertainties can 
stem from insufficient data on site characteristics, hydrology, and other environmental variables which 
influences the transport and conversion of inorganic C into CO2. There may also be uncertainties due to 
insufficient knowledge about the processes and/or the ability of country-specific emission factors or estimation 
systems to represent the fate of urea-C. 
11.4.5 
Completeness, Time series consistency, QA/QC 
COMPLETENESS 
Tier 1 
Tier 1 inventories are complete if emissions are computed based on a full accounting of all urea that is applied to 
soils. Urea usage statistics or sales provide the most direct inference on applications to soils, but production and 
import/export records are sufficient for making an approximate estimate of the amount of urea applied to soils. If 
current data are not sufficient due to incomplete records, it is good practice to gather additional data for future 
inventory reporting, particularly if urea-C emissions are a key source category. 
Tier 2 
Completeness in Tier 2 inventories is also dependent on the adequacy of the activity data (see Tier 1), but will 
also depend on additional country-specific data that was used to refine emission factors. This may include the 
availability of data about site-level and hydrological data that are used to better specify emission factors relating 
the amount of CO2 released per amount of urea-C added to soils. 
Tier 3 
Beyond the considerations for Tiers 1 and 2, completeness of Tier 3 inventories is also dependent on the data 
needs and representativeness of the measurement design and/or modelling framework. Inventory compilers 
should review their approach and determine if the advanced estimation system is adequate to address the net 
release of CO2 from urea applied to soils. If gaps or limitations are identified, it is good practice to gather 
additional data so that the fate of urea-C is fully addressed by the Tier 3 method. 
TIME SERIES CONSISTENCY 
Tier 1 
The same activity data and emissions factors should be applied across the entire time series for consistency. At 
the Tier 1 level, default emission factors are used so consistency is not an issue for this component. However, the 
basis for the activity data may change if new data are gathered, such as a statistical survey compiling information 
on urea applications to soils versus older activity relying strictly on domestic production and import/export data. 
While it is good practice for the same data protocols and procedures to be used across the entire time series, in 
some cases this may not be possible, and inventory compilers should determine the influence of changing data 
sources on the trends. Guidance on recalculation for these circumstances is presented in Volume 1, of Chapter 5. 
Tier 2 
Consistency in activity data records across the time series is important for Tier 2 inventories (see Tier 1). In 
addition, new factors that are developed based on country-specific data should be applied across the entire time 
series. In rare cases when this is not possible, inventory compilers should determine the influence of changing 
emission factors on the trends; additional guidance on recalculation for these circumstances can be found in 
Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
Tier 3 
Similar to Tier 2, it is good practice to apply the country-specific estimation system throughout the entire time 
series; inventory agencies should use the same measurement protocols (sampling strategy, method, etc.) and/or 
model-based system throughout the inventory time period. 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
Tier 1 
It is good practice to implement Quality Assurance/Quality Controls with internal and independent reviews of 
inventory data and results, ensuring 1) activity data have been processed appropriately to estimate application to 
soils, 2) activity data have been properly transcribed into the worksheets or inventory computation software, and 
3) emission factors have been assigned appropriately. 
Internal reviews should be conducted by the inventory compiler(s), and may involve visual inspection as well as 
built-in program functions to check data entry and results. Independent reviews are conducted by other agencies, 
experts or groups who are not directly involved with the compilation. These reviews need to consider the validity 
of the inventory approach, thoroughness of inventory documentation, methods explanation and overall 
transparency. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
11.36 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Tier 2 
In addition to the Quality Assurance/Quality Control measures under Tier 1, the inventory compiler should 
review the country-specific emission factors for Tier 2 inventories. If using factors based on direct 
measurements, the inventory compiler should review the measurements to ensure that they are representative of 
the actual range of environmental conditions. If accessible, it is good practice to compare the country-specific 
factors with Tier 2 emission factors used by other countries with comparable circumstances, in addition to the 
IPCC defaults. Given the complexity of inorganic C transformations, specialists in the field should be involved 
in the review process, to provide an independent critique of the emission factors. 
Tier 3 
Country-specific inventory systems will likely need additional Quality Assurance/Quality Control measures, but 
this will be dependent on the systems that are developed. It is good practice to develop a Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control protocol that is specific to the country’s advanced estimation system, archive the 
reports, and include summary results in reporting documentation. 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
Tier 1 
For Tier 1, inventory compilers should document trends and uncertainties in urea applications to soils and relate 
those patterns to the CO2 emission trends. Significant fluctuations in annual emissions across the time series 
should be explained. 
It is good practice to archive databases, such as domestic production, import/export records or usage statistics 
from surveys, and procedures used to process the data (e.g., statistical programs). The worksheets or inventory 
software, which was used to estimate emissions, should be archived along with the input/output files that were 
generated to produce the results. 
In cases where activity data are not available directly from databases or multiple data sets were combined, the 
information, assumptions and procedures that were used to derive the activity data should be described. This 
documentation should include the frequency of data collection and estimation, and uncertainty. Use of expert 
knowledge should be documented and correspondences archived. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the considerations for Tier 1, inventory compilers should document the underlying basis for 
country-specific emission factors, as well as archive metadata and data sources used to estimate country-specific 
values. Reporting documentation should include the new factors (i.e., means and uncertainties), and it is good 
practice to include a discussion in the inventory report about differences between country-specific factors and 
default values or country-specific factors from regions with similar circumstances to those of the reporting 
country. 
When discussing trends in emissions and removals from year to year, a distinction should be made between 
changes in activity levels and changes in methods, including emission factors, and the reasons for these changes 
need to be documented. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 inventories need similar documentation about activity data and emission/removal trends as lower tier 
approaches, but additional documentation should be included to explain the underlying basis and framework for 
country-specific estimation systems. With measurement-based inventories, it is good practice to document the 
sampling design, laboratory procedures and data analysis techniques. Measurement data should be archived, 
along with results from data analyses. For Tier 3 approaches using modelling, it is good practice to document the 
model version and provide a model description, as well as to permanently archive copies of all model input files, 
source code and executable programs.
