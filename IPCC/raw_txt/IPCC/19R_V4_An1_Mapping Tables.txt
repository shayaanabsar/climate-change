2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
CHAPTER 2 GENERIC METHODS 
This section has several refinements including a) guidance on application of allometric model and biomass 
density maps for estimation of biomass C; b) refinements on the guidance to estimate changes in dead organic 
matter and updates to the factors; c) refinements to the description of methods and factors to estimate soil C 
stock change in mineral soils, and the addition of a Tier 2 method to estimate the C stock changes from biochar 
amendments; d) expanded guidance on application of Tier 3 methods; and e) methods for estimating the 
influence of inter-annual variability on greenhouse gas emissions.  There was limited refinement to the methods 
for estimating non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning. 
Sections 
 Section 2.3.1 provides definitions and new guidance to inventory compilers on the use of allometric models 
to estimate volume, biomass and carbon stocks in land uses containing vegetation at Tier 2 and 3 levels, 
including a decision tree to select the appropriated one. The section also provides guidance on how to use of 
biomass density maps for the estimation of carbon emissions at Tier 2 and Tier 3 levels. 
 Section 2.3.2 provides updates on methods and factors for estimating changes in C for dead organic matter. 
 Section 2.3.3 provides refinements for estimation of soil C stock changes in mineral soils including more 
guidance about application of Tier 2 and 3 methods. For Tier 3, several examples are provided that describe 
methods that have been applied for reporting soil C stock changes by countries. Guidance is provided on 
using mass-equivalency methods and assessing the impact of soil erosion and deposition. Updates have been 
made to the default reference C stocks for estimating C stock changes in mineral soils. New guidance is 
provided to estimate the change in soil C stocks with biochar amendments to soils in grassland and cropland. 
Biochar C has been intensively studied over the past decade and the recent research has provided a scientific 
basis for developing a Tier 2 method. Tier 3 methods may also be developed to estimate impacts of biochar 
amendments on soil C stocks in forest land, settlements, wetlands and other land. 
 Section 2.4 is refined to provide a method for estimating mass of fuel in croplands that is consistent with the 
method for estimating soil N2O emissions from crop residues (i.e., mass of residues). Ensuring consistency 
among sources is considered a good practice and is the primary reason that the method for estimating mass of 
fuel has been refined. 
 Section 2.5 is revised to expand the guidance on how to parameterize and evaluate Tier 3 models, the 
integration of data to models, and means to increase its transparency. Case studies have been included to 
demonstrate how different countries have developed and worked with Tier 3 methods.   
 Section 2.6 is added to provide an option that may be used to disaggregate Managed Land Proxy (MLP) 
emissions and removals into those that are considered to result from human effects and those that are 
considered to result from natural disturbances. 
 An annex is provided to describe the data that have been used to estimate default reference C stocks for the 
mineral soil method.  An annex is also provided describing the underlying scientific basis for developing Tier 
2 and 3 methods to estimate soil C stock change from biochar C amendments to soils.

CHAPTER 3 CONSISTENT REPRESENTATION OF LANDS 
In this chapter updates (U) and new guidance (NG) were introduced to provide a sound scientific basis for 
representing land area, land-use change and related emissions and removals in the AFOLU sector. It treats 
specifically how to combine different data sources and types of information (with a special focus on Remoting 
Sensing (RS) data and products), the coherence between national land-use classification systems and IPCC land-
use categories, uncertainty and accuracy of activity data, and the specificities of RS data.  
Sections 
 While No Refinement was mandated, an elaboration is introduced in Section 3.1 to outline the main steps 
necessary to achieve consistent representation of lands at the national level for inventory purposes. The steps 
are detailed in following sections. 
 In Section 3.2 elaborations were introduced to further explain the terms “land-use” and “land cover”; the 
consistency of national definitions with the IPCC land-use categories; the total area (managed and 
unmanaged) consistency through the reporting period and to provide further guidance on assigning IPCC 
land-use and land-use change categories. 
 In Section 3.3. the 2006 text has been reviewed and refined to elaborate guidance on how to integrate 
different data types and sources for the consistent representation of lands, in order to improve transparency, 
consistency and accuracy of land-use, land-use change and related GHG emissions and removals estimates. 
The refinement includes new guidance on how to combine the data, how to derive IPCC land-use categories 
(including land-use classification and stratification processes) and tracking and distinguishing land-use 
changes. 
 Section 3.4 provide new guidance on how to use, combine and integrate different approaches and tiers to 
derive consistent emissions and removals estimated from land-use change. A special reference is made to the 
use of biomass maps. 
 Even though “No Refinement” was mandated in Section 3.5 authors have decided to include the proposed 
refinement on Activity Data uncertainty in this section. The elaborated text in this Section is to be read in

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
CHAPTER 5 CROPLANDS 
Refinements in this chapter are associated with biomass and soil C sections, in addition to the rice cultivation 
section of the guidance.  There are no refinements to the guidance for dead organic matter or non-CO2 
greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning. 
The biomass C section refined guidance for Tier 1 methodologies for Croplands remaining Croplands by 
clarifying how to use default factors for perennial crops above-ground woody biomass growth rate; and biomass 
losses from removal, fuelwood and disturbance. The section also provides updated default factors, additional 
examples of perennial cropland subcategories, and guidance on activity data required for carbon gain estimation.  
There is also guidance on how to calculate ΔCG for Land converted to Cropland, and updated carbon stocks 
default factors for present stocks after a year of conversion and updated the references to Chapter 4 and 6 for 
carbon stocks removed by the conversion. 
Refinements in the soil C sections is associated with updates to default factors, additional guidance on 
developing Tier 2 stock change factors, new Tier 2 steady state method that can be used to estimate country-
specific stock change factors, and guidance for estimating the impact of biochar C amendments on C stocks in 
mineral soils.  There has been new research on land use change and tillage management since the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines was published that informed the derivation of new stock change factors. The updated factors are 
based on a new literature review and analysis for land use factors including long-term cultivation, paddy rice 
cultivation, and perennial woody crops, in addition to tillage management factors. See Annex 5A.1 for methods 
that have been used to develop the new factors. The Tier 2 steady-state method provides an alternative method 
for compilers to develop country-specific stock change factors. The activity data requirements of this method are 
different and from the default method and may provide an opportunity for some countries to conduct an 
inventory of soil C stock changes in mineral soils of croplands that is not feasible with the default method due to 
the activity data requirements. Biochar C has been intensively studied over the past decade and provided the 
basis for development of a Tier 2 method.   
Refinements to estimation of CH4 emissions from rice cultivation include updates on the following: (i) baseline 
emission factor (EFc) at a global scale (with new default values at regional scale); (ii) scaling factors for water 
regimes before and during the cultivation periods; and (iii) default conversion factors for different types of 
organic amendments. A new table on default cultivation periods, at global and regional scales, is provided, and a 
new section showing an example of how to implement the Tier 1 method. Also included is a new box on good 
practice guidance for developing EFc.  
Sections 
 Section 5.2.1 provides refinements associated with updated factors for coefficients for above and below 
ground biomass and above-ground for harvest cycles in agroforestry systems, and biomass accumulation 
rates for perennial cropland monocultures to estimate biomass, and further refinement to the Tier 1 methods 
description based on the updated default factors. The guidance on activity data has also been updated.  
 Section 5.2.3 has new stock change factors based on a review of the land use and tillage studies. An annex 
has been updated with details about how the default stock change factors have been estimated. There is also a 
new steady-state method that has been added as an alternative approach for developing country-specific stock 
change factors.  The updates include parameters are provided for the new steady-state method, and  an annex 
describing the parameterisation method. This section has new guidance on a Tier 2 method to estimate the 
impact of biochar C amendments on soils in croplands. Guidance is also provided on the activity data 
requirements for biochar C and steady-state methods. 
 Section 5.3.1 includes clarification on how to estimate biomass resulting from the Land conversion to 
croplands using Tier 1 methodologies. The section also updates the references to the updated tables in the 
chapter 5 and updated tables contained in other chapters (4 and 6) to find the appropriated default factors for 
carbon stocks present after the conversion and the carbon stocks removed by the conversion. In addition, 
provides further guidance on how to deal with conversion of Forest Lands to Croplands for Tier 2 
methodologies. 
 Section 5.5 with guidance on rice cultivation has been updated by revising the equation to estimate the 
“Adjusted Daily Emission Factor”. Two equations are provided to estimate this factor: the first equation is 
applicable to Tier 1, while the second equation is for Tier 2. Description of the Tier 2 method has been 
updated as appropriate. Examples are listed with references for countries that have used Tier 3 methods for 
reporting CH4 emissions from rice cultivation. Updates to emission and scaling factors include default 
cultivation periods, and a new water regime for the scaling factor, SFp (before cultivation period) has been 
added and the scope of its application is further refined, particularly with regard to methane emissions that 
occur before the cultivation period and after harvest. For Tier 2 factors, a reference has been added to Box 
5.1A about how to develop a baseline emission factor for rice cultivation. A new Annex 5A.2 is included to 
 
Annex 1: Mapping Tables 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
A1.17 
fully describe the background for developing the default emission factors and scaling factors for methane 
emission from paddy field. A new Section 5.5.4 has been added to provide an example of how to calculate 
methane emission from rice using the Tier 1 method.  The section on Uncertainty Assessment has been 
updated with information on the conditions that influence methane emission and scaling factors, and how 
uncertainty can be reduced.

CHAPTER 6 GRASSLANDS 
Refinements in this chapter are all associated with the soil C section of the guidance. The refinements include a 
new classification scheme for grazing management systems, updates to the guidance for Tier 2 methods in the 
soil section, and guidance for estimating the impact of biochar C amendments on C stocks in mineral soils. The 
refinement to the grazing management system is associated with introducing a management system with high 
intensity grazing to replace moderately degraded systems. Classifying high intensity grazing is more objective 
and can be determined from local grassland production in many countries.  In addition, more studies are 
available to estimate the impact of high intensity grazing compared to moderately degraded systems.  Biochar C 
has been intensively studied over the past decade and provided the basis for development of a Tier 2 method for 
grasslands. 
There are no refinements to the guidance on biomass, dead organic matter, or non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions 
from biomass burning. 
Sections 
 Sections 6.2.3 and 6.3.3 with new guidance for estimating changes in soil C for mineral soils. The updates 
include a revision to the classification for management systems and new management factors. There is also 
new guidance on a Tier 2 method to estimate the impact of biochar C amendments on soils in grassland.

CHAPTER 7 WETLANDS 
Refinements to this Chapter are development of Flooded Lands section on CO2 and CH4 emissions and removals 
from Flooded Land Remaining Flooding Land and Land Converted to Flooded Land. The methods developed 
are consistent with the managed land proxy, and include an optional approach to develop indicative estimates of 
the anthropogenic component of total CO2 and non-CO2 emissions from flooded lands. Methods and emission 
factors are presented for Reservoirs and Other constructed waterbodies. 
There are no refinements to the sections on peatlands. 
Sections 
 Section 7.3 has been refined with new guidance for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from Flooded Land 
Remaining Flooding Land and Land Converted to Flooded Land. 
 Section 7.6, Future Methodological Development has been removed from the guidance because the methods 
have been developed in the 2013 IPCC Wetlands Supplement and in this refinement.

CHAPTER 10 EMISSIONS FROM LIVESTOCK AND MANURE 
MANAGEMENT 
Improvements to this Chapter were made to: i.) Update outdated emission factors and emission factors that could 
be improved through new knowledge; ii.) Improve the treatment of the relationship between productivity and 
emissions, focusing in particular on the ability to differentiate between commercial/industrial production systems 
and local/subsistence systems and; iii.) Improving the consistency of methods among emission sources, to 
facilitate the use of consistent activity data and livestock characterizations among sources and assure that the 
calculation and transfers of parameters among enteric fermentation, volatile solid and manure methane estimates, 
and nitrogen excretion, transfers and losses are consistent throughout the Chapter and with Chapter 11, Managed 
soils. 
Sections 
 Section 10.2 Livestock population and feed characterisation. The Tier 1 method was updated by integrating 
an advanced Tier 1a. This method is to be applied in cases where agricultural production systems may be 
transitioning from low productivity local subsistence systems to higher productivity systems or may simply 
have dual agricultural systems. In these cases, inventory compilers may wish to use the Tier 1a approach in 
which they are able to better track the transitions and changes in the productivity of their agricultural systems 
and related emissions over time.  
 Various updates were made to text: i) Where references or information provided were dated; ii) To provide 
suggestions for sources of activity data and parameters sources; iii) Crude protein and neutral detergent fibre 
were added to the parameters to be collected for animal categories for the implementation of Tier 2 methods. 
 The Tier 2 method was updated through the addition of parameters for a Tier 2 characterization of goat 
production, resulting in modifications to many Tables and Figures. 
 The Simplified Tier 2 approach was updated to be consistent with methods in the most recent National 
Research Council publications and replace the Dairy cattle equations with a more recent method. 
 Section 10.3 Methane emissions from enteric fermentation. The Tier 1 Emission Factors for Cattle, Buffalo, 
Sheep and Goats were updated based on an extensive review of the literature and global production systems. 
Emission factors for low and high productivity systems (Tier 1a EFs) for regions that have dual production 
systems for cattle, sheep and goats were developed (the terms high and low productivity systems were 
substituted for developed and developing countries used in the 2006 IPCC guidelines). Emission Factors for 
minor animal categories were reviewed and updated where information was available. Guidance was 
provided to implement the Tier 1a approach. 
 The discussion and guidance to implement methane conversion rates (Ym) was updated. The values presented 
for methane conversion rates were expanded to be consistent with different levels of productivity for Dairy 
cows and to take into account differing diets used in other cattle production systems. Methane yields were 
included to simplify the implementation of the simplified Tier 2 approach. 
 Section 10.4 Methane emissions from manure management. The approach to implement Tier 1 emission 
estimates was changed from a per head basis (kg CH4 head-1) to a per volatile solid (g CH4 kg VS-1) basis to 
be consistent with the Tier 1 approach for nitrous oxide emissions. A Tier 1 approach for calculating volatile 
solids was introduced with values derived using consistent data for enteric fermentation and nitrogen 
excretion. Emission Factors were presented for high and low productivity systems based on the 2006 IPCC 
guideline parameters and updated MCFs developed for the Tier 2 method. Per head emission factors for 
minor livestock were reviewed and updated where new information was available.  
 In the Tier 2 method, the MCFs developed for major livestock categories were changed from being derived 
based on an annual temperature basis to being derived from monthly temperatures in climate zones and 
considering manure storage duration. A simple model was developed for the calculation of MCFs based on 
monthly temperature profiles and storage duration (presented in Annex A.3 and available for download). 
New anaerobic digestion MCFs were developed for different qualities of digesters and considering the 
storage of digestate. 
 Section 10.5 N2O emissions from manure management. Direct Emissions: Nitrogen excretion values were 
updated using data consistent with the derivation of enteric fermentation EFs and volatile solid EFs. 
Emission Factors for direct emissions were reviewed and updated where possible. A Tier 2 method was 
introduced for N excretion for swine and poultry.  
 Indirect Emissions: Improved guidance was provided to calculate losses and transfers of N to managed soils 
(Consistency of nitrogen flows, Section 10.5.6). A detailed Table consistent with other manure management 
system tables for manure N loss was introduced. A Tier 1 leaching factor was introduced to account for loss 
 
Annex 1: Mapping Tables 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
A1.33 
from manure management storage and changes were made to the approach to calculate total N loss, to assure 
that all N is accounted for in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methodology. 
 Annex 10A – All data used in calculating Tier 1 parameters, enteric fermentation, volatile solids and nitrogen 
excretion were compiled in Annexes 10A.1 and 10A.2 in Tables 10A.1 to 10A.4. Default values for animal 
weights and manure management systems were compiled in Tables 10A.5 to 10A.9. An explanation of the 
simple model that is presented for calculating MCFs considering monthly temperature profiles and manure 
storage durations in Annex 10A.3. A series of equations is presented in Annex 10A.4 to calculate MCFs from 
anaerobic digesters. A clear description of the equations required in the calculation of nitrogen movement 
through the agricultural system is presented in Annex 10A.4 
 Annex 10B – Brief explanations are provided that provide an overview or justification of how new 
parameters were selected or developed for the Chapter.

Tables 
 In Section 10.2, Table 10.1 added high and low productivity systems and identified the enhanced livestock 
definitions that would go with them while Table 10.2 was modified to update information in it, such that the 
values were consistent with production systems in 2019.  
 Modifications to Tables 10.3 to 10.7 provide additional values required to calculate Tier 2 estimates for goat 
production and clarify elements that were raised during the Guidance review process.  
 In the simplified Tier 2 methodology a new Table 10.8A was added for mature cattle DMI estimates. 
 In Section 10.3, Tables 10.10 and 10.11 Tier 1 emission factors were updated and Tier 1a emission factors 
were developed.  The methane conversion rate (Ym) Table 10.12 was expanded to integrate Yms for different 
productivity levels and feeding systems and Sheep and Goat Yms were updated (Table 10.13). 
 In Section 10.4, Table 10.14 was developed with emission factors based on volatile solids replacing two 
Tables with Emission factors expressed on a per head basis. Table 13A was added to calculate Tier 1 volatile 
solids.  Table 16 moved the maximum methane potentials (B0) which were previously in the Annex in the 
main text of the Chapter. 
 The Table 10.17 was updated with MCFs based on climate zones and manure storage durations. 
 In Section 10.5, N excretion (Table 10.19) values and N retention (Table 10.20) values were updated and 
some N2O emission Factors (Table 10.21) were updated. N loss factors (Table 10.22) were presented in a 
consistent manner with all other manure management systems and default leaching factors were added. 
Finally, a Table was added for use in the estimation of denitrification (Table 10.23). 
 In the Annexes all information for the calculation of Tier 1 Enteric Fermentation emission factors, volatile 
solids and nitrogen excretion for cattle and buffalo were presented in a series of four Tables. All default 
information required to carry out Tier 1 emission estimates for manure management are presented in Tables 
10A.5 to 10A.9. Tables 10A.10 through 10A.18 provide supporting material for the development of the 
revisions to guidance presented in this refinement.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
CHAPTER 11 N2O EMISSIONS FROM MANAGED SOILS AND CO 2 
EMISSIONS FROM LIME AND UREA APPLICATIONS 
Refinements in Chapter 11 include updates of the emission factors EF1, EF1FR and EF3PRP (Table 11.1) and EF4, 
EF5, FracGASF FracGASM and FracLEACH-(H) (Table 11.3). Updated aggregated values were computed for all of these 
factors drawing on a much larger number of measurements than were available for the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
Furthermore, disaggregated EF1, EF3PRP, CPP and EF4 values for wet and dry climates are provided, with a 
distinction between synthetic and other fertilisers in wet climate for the EF1. In addition, the EF1FR is 
disaggregated by flooding / drainage regime. Finally, different FracGASF values are provided according to 
chemical composition of fertiliser categories. Data and methods used for these updates are provided in Annexes 
11A.2 – 9.  
Refinements also include an update of the equation for calculating the annual amount of N in crop residues 
returned to soils annually (FCR) (Equation 11.6). Default values to be used in this Equation are available in the 
new Table 11.1A. Notwithstanding, the alternative to estimate the above-ground crop residue (AGDM(T)) with 
data in Table 11.2 remains available in the guidance.  
Sections 
 Slight rewording was done in section 11.2. 
 Section 11.2.1.1 has an update to footnote 1 and guidance for locating EF2 values in the Wetland supplement. 
Information is also provided for Tier 2 approaches such as factors specific to mitigation options (e.g. 
application of nitrification inhibitors) or exponential response of N2O emissions to N application. 
Complementary guidance for Tier 3 approach (e.g. N-flow principle) is also added. 
 Section 11.2.1.2 is updated according to updated EF values of TABLE 11.1. 
 Section 11.2.1.3 is updated with a link to FAOSTAT throughout the section. Substantial changes are brought 
to subsection Crop residue N, including N-fixing crops and forage/ pasture renewal, returned to soils 
otherwise most of the text is unchanged. In subsection Crop residue N, including N-fixing crops and forage/ 
pasture renewal, returned to soils (FCR), text is added to eliminate the possibility of double-counting by 
cross-checking with Chapters 10 (Livestock and manure management) and 5 (Cropland). Equation 11.6 is 
updated and Equation 11.7A has been removed. The existing text is also slightly edited following the review 
process. A new Table (Table 11.1A) is added that is used to produce default values from Table 11.2 in the 
2006 IPCC Guidelines and introduces new default values to be used in updated Equation 11.6. Table 11.2 is 
updated, default values remain unchanged but AGDM(T) has been changed to be in conformity with equation 
11.6 and several variables are moved to new Table 11.1A. 
 Section 11.2.2 has minor edits. 
 Section 11.2.2.1 information is updated for Tier 2 approaches such as factors specific to mitigation options 
(e.g. application of nitrification inhibitors). Complementary guidance for Tier 3 approach (e.g. N-flow 
principle) was also added. 
 Section 11.2.2.2 is edited to reflect the updates for the emission factor FracLEACH-(H).

ground residues dry matter (R AG(T)) to harvested yield for crop T, to be used in updated version of Equation 
11.6. 
 Table 11.2 is updated. The title “Default factors for estimation of N added to soils from crop residues” is 
changed to “Alternative method and data for estimating above-ground residue AGDM(T)”. The units of 
AGDM(T)are changed from Mg ha-1 to kg. d.m. ha-1; in alignment with the unit in Equation 11.6. Default 
values for slope, intercept, errors remain unchanged. Former columns ‘Dry matter fraction of harvested 
product (DRY)’, ‘N content of above-ground residues (NAG)’, ‘Ratio of below-ground residues to above-
ground biomass (RBG-BIO)’, and ‘N content of below-ground residues (NBG)’ are moved to new Table 11.1A.

CHAPTER 12 HARVESTED WOOD PRODUCTS 
The guidance in chapter 12 maintains the existing approaches covered in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The 
refinement takes account of new relevant scientific information, including relevant methodological information 
and parameters contained in KP Supplement (e.g. carbon conversion factors). Some cross references are made to 
the earlier guidance where needed, for example in cases where it may be helpful to show consistency with the 
earlier guidance. The new structure of this chapter aims to clarify the relationships between new information and 
the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and to allow for inclusion and updating of new parameters where appropriate. The 
description of the application of methodologies is clarified based on the updated parameters. Section 12.2 
clarifies some existing terms, definitions and concepts. Section 12.3 provides guidance on available HWP 
approaches, describing and clarifying the options for defining a conceptual framework and system boundary for 
estimating emissions and removals arising from HWP. 
The subsequent guidance in this chapter is structured to consider three distinct subject areas relevant to harvested 
wood biomass: i) wood products in use (i.e. wood utilised as a material); ii) wood biomass used for energy 
purposes and iii) wood biomass in solid waste disposal sites (SWDS). Section 12.4 gives detailed guidance on 
wood products in use, specifically providing good practice guidance on the choice of method for wood products 
in use. This includes improved methodological guidance for estimating CO2 emissions and removals arising 
from HWP following different approaches. This section also includes refined guidance for calculating the initial 
carbon stock in the HWP pool in use as well as parameters such as HWP carbon conversion factors. Section 12.5 
addresses wood biomass used for energy purposes. Section 12.6 provides clarification of the treatment of “wood 
biomass in SWDS”.  
It should also be noted that the HWP Worksheet accompanying the 2006 IPCC Guidelines (HWP calculator) 
cannot be used in conjunction with this updated guidance. No update on reporting and documentation has been 
included since the reporting conventions and format are specified in Decision 24/CP.19 Annex II and the 
associated CRF. 
Sections 
 Section 12.1 provides an overview of the HWP chapter in the 2019 Refinement. Updates the explanation of 
some key concepts relevant to estimation based on updated parameters. 
 Section 12.2 updates (clarifies) the description of some existing terms, definitions and concepts.  
 Section 12.3 updates the explanation of the different HWP approaches. Clarifies essential differences 
between approaches including brief discussion of the implications of selecting HWP approaches relevant to 
estimation based on updated technical parameters. 
 Section 12.4 updates methodological guidance for estimating under the approaches, including updated 
guidance for applying technical parameters for the calculation of initial stock establishment and updated 
technical parameters including HWP carbon conversion factors. Includes an update of all technical 
parameters relevant to estimation methods. 
 Section 12.5 updates the discussion to clarify where CO2 and non-CO2 emissions from harvested wood used 
for energy purposes are reported, in particular where CO2 emissions are reported when HWP are used in the 
Energy sector and imports and exports are involved. 
 Section 12.6 provides clarification of the treatment of “wood biomass in SWDS” in this guidance. 
 Section 12.7 updates discussion of uncertainty assessment allowing for updated description of application of 
technical parameters for Tiers 1 to 3. 
 Section 12.8 updates the discussion of QA/QC allowing for updated description of application of technical 
parameters. 
 Annex 12.A.1 updated technical description of HWP approaches is provided in the annex.
