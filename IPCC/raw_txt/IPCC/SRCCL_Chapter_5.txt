Executive summary
The current food system (production, transport, processing, 
packaging, storage, retail, consumption, loss and waste) feeds 
the great majority of world population and supports the 
livelihoods of over 1 billion people. Since 1961, food supply per 
capita has increased more than 30%, accompanied by greater use 
of nitrogen fertilisers (increase of about 800%) and water resources 
for irrigation (increase of more than 100%). However, an estimated 
821 million people are currently undernourished, 151 million children 
under five are stunted, 613 million women and girls aged 15 to 49 
suffer from iron deficiency, and 2 billion adults are overweight or 
obese. The food system is under pressure from non-climate stressors 
(e.g.,  population and income growth, demand for animal-sourced 
products), and from climate change. These climate and non-climate 
stresses are impacting the four pillars of food security (availability, 
access, utilisation, and stability). {5.1.1, 5.1.2} 
Observed climate change is already affecting food security 
through increasing temperatures, changing precipitation 
patterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events (high 
confidence). Studies that separate out climate change from other 
factors affecting crop yields have shown that yields of some crops 
(e.g., maize and wheat) in many lower-latitude regions have been 
affected negatively by observed climate changes, while in many 
higher-latitude regions, yields of some crops (e.g., maize, wheat, 
and sugar beets) have been affected positively over recent decades. 
Warming compounded by drying has caused large negative effects 
on yields in parts of the Mediterranean. Based on indigenous and 
local knowledge (ILK), climate change is affecting food security in 
drylands, particularly those in Africa, and high mountain regions of 
Asia and South America. {5.2.2}
Food security will be increasingly affected by projected future 
climate change (high confidence). Across Shared Socio-economic 
Pathways (SSPs)  1,  2, and  3, global crop and economic models 
projected a 1–29% cereal price increase in 2050 due to climate change 
(RCP 6.0), which would impact consumers globally through higher 
food prices; regional effects will vary (high confidence). Low-income 
consumers are particularly at risk, with models projecting increases 
of 1–183 million additional people at risk of hunger across the SSPs 
compared to a no climate change scenario (high confidence). While 
increased CO2 is projected to be beneficial for crop productivity at 
lower temperature increases, it is projected to lower nutritional 
quality (high confidence) (e.g., wheat grown at 546–586 ppm CO2 
has  5.9–12.7% less protein,  3.7–6.5% less zinc, and  5.2–7.5% 
less iron). Distributions of pests and diseases will change, affecting 
production negatively in many regions (high confidence). Given 
increasing extreme events and interconnectedness, risks of food 
system disruptions are growing (high confidence). {5.2.3, 5.2.4} 
Vulnerability of pastoral systems to climate change is very high 
(high confidence). Pastoralism is practiced in more than 75% of 
countries by between 200 and 500 million people, including nomadic 
communities, transhumant herders, and agropastoralists. Impacts 
in pastoral systems in Africa include lower pasture and animal 
productivity, damaged reproductive function, and biodiversity loss. 
Pastoral system vulnerability is exacerbated by non-climate factors 
(land tenure, sedentarisation, changes in traditional institutions, 
invasive species, lack of markets, and conflicts). {5.2.2}
Fruit and vegetable production, a key component of healthy 
diets, is also vulnerable to climate change (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Declines in yields and crop suitability are projected 
under higher temperatures, especially in tropical and semi-tropical 
regions. Heat stress reduces fruit set and speeds up development of 
annual vegetables, resulting in yield losses, impaired product quality, 
and increasing food loss and waste. Longer growing seasons enable 
a greater number of plantings to be cultivated and can contribute 
to greater annual yields. However, some fruits and vegetables need 
a  period of cold accumulation to produce a  viable harvest, and 
warmer winters may constitute a risk. {5.2.2}
Food security and climate change have strong gender and 
equity dimensions (high confidence). Worldwide, women play 
a  key role in food security, although regional differences exist. 
Climate change impacts vary among diverse social groups depending 
on age, ethnicity, gender, wealth, and class. Climate extremes 
have immediate and long-term impacts on livelihoods of poor 
and vulnerable communities, contributing to greater risks of food 
insecurity that can be a stress multiplier for internal and external 
migration (medium confidence). {5.2.6} Empowering women and 
rights-based approaches to decision-making can create synergies 
among household food security, adaptation, and mitigation. {5.6.4} 
Many practices can be optimised and scaled up to advance 
adaptation throughout the food system (high confidence). 
Supply-side options include increased soil organic matter and 
erosion control, improved cropland, livestock, grazing land 
management, and genetic improvements for tolerance to heat and 
drought. Diversification in the food system (e.g.,  implementation 
of integrated production systems, broad-based genetic resources, 
and heterogeneous diets) is a key strategy to reduce risks (medium 
confidence). Demand-side adaptation, such as adoption of healthy 
and sustainable diets, in conjunction with reduction in food loss and 
waste, can contribute to adaptation through reduction in additional 
land area needed for food production and associated food system 
vulnerabilities. ILK can contribute to enhancing food system resilience 
(high confidence). {5.3, 5.6.3 Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5}
About 21–37% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are 
attributable to the food system. These are from agriculture 
and land use, storage, transport, packaging, processing, retail, 
and consumption (medium confidence). This estimate includes 
emissions of 9–14% from crop and livestock activities within the 
farm gate and 5–14% from land use and land-use change including 
deforestation and peatland degradation (high confidence); 5–10% 
is from supply chain activities (medium confidence). This estimate 
includes GHG emissions from food loss and waste. Within the food 
system, during the period 2007–2016, the major sources of emissions 
from the supply side were agricultural production, with crop and 
livestock activities within the farm gate generating respectively 
142 ± 42 TgCH4 yr–1 (high confidence) and 8.0 ± 2.5 TgN2O yr–1 
(high confidence), and CO2 emissions linked to relevant land-use 
440

change dynamics such as deforestation and peatland degradation, 
generating  4.9 ±  2.5  GtCO2  yr–1. Using 100-year GWP values 
(no climate feedback) from the IPCC AR5, this implies that total GHG 
emissions from agriculture were 6.2 ± 1.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1, increasing 
to 11.1 ±  2.9  GtCO2-eq yr–1 including relevant land use. Without 
intervention, these are likely to increase by about 30–40% by 2050, 
due to increasing demand based on population and income growth 
and dietary change (high confidence). {5.4} 
Supply-side practices can contribute to climate change 
mitigation by reducing crop and livestock emissions, 
sequestering carbon in soils and biomass, and by decreasing 
emissions intensity within sustainable production systems 
(high confidence). Total technical mitigation potential from 
crop and livestock activities and agroforestry is estimated 
as  2.3–9.6  GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence). Options 
with large potential for GHG mitigation in cropping systems include 
soil carbon sequestration (at decreasing rates over time), reductions 
in N2O emissions from fertilisers, reductions in CH4 emissions from 
paddy rice, and bridging of yield gaps. Options with large potential 
for mitigation in livestock systems include better grazing land 
management, with increased net primary production and soil carbon 
stocks, improved manure management, and higher-quality feed. 
Reductions in GHG emissions intensity (emissions per unit product) 
from livestock can support reductions in absolute emissions, provided 
appropriate governance to limit total production is implemented at 
the same time (medium confidence). {5.5.1} 
Consumption of healthy and sustainable diets presents major 
opportunities for reducing GHG emissions from food systems 
and improving health outcomes (high confidence). Examples 
of healthy and sustainable diets are high in coarse grains, pulses, 
fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds; low in energy-intensive 
animal-sourced and discretionary foods (such as sugary beverages); 
and with a  carbohydrate threshold. Total technical mitigation 
potential of dietary changes is estimated as 0.7–8.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
by 2050 (medium confidence). This estimate includes reductions in 
emissions from livestock and soil carbon sequestration on spared land, 
but co-benefits with health are not taken into account. Mitigation 
potential of dietary change may be higher, but achievement of this 
potential at broad scales depends on consumer choices and dietary 
preferences that are guided by social, cultural, environmental, and 
traditional factors, as well as income growth. Meat analogues such as 
imitation meat (from plant products), cultured meat, and insects may 
help in the transition to more healthy and sustainable diets, although 
their carbon footprints and acceptability are uncertain. {5.5.2, 5.6.5}
Reduction of food loss and waste could lower GHG emissions 
and improve food security (medium confidence). Combined 
food loss and waste amount to 25–30% of total food produced 
(medium confidence). During 2010–2016, global food loss and 
waste equalled  8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions 
(medium confidence); and cost about 1 trillion USD2012 per year 
(low confidence). Technical options for reduction of food loss and 
waste include improved harvesting techniques, on-farm storage, 
infrastructure, and packaging. Causes of food loss (e.g.,  lack of 
refrigeration) and waste (e.g.,  behaviour) differ substantially in 
developed and developing countries, as well as across regions (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). {5.5.2}
Agriculture and the food system are key to global climate 
change responses. Combining supply-side actions such 
as efficient production, transport, and processing with 
demand-side interventions such as modification of food choices, 
and reduction of food loss and waste, reduces GHG emissions 
and enhances food system resilience (high confidence). Such 
combined measures can enable the implementation of large-scale 
land-based adaptation and mitigation strategies without threatening 
food security from increased competition for land for food production 
and higher food prices. Without combined food system measures 
in farm management, supply chains, and demand, adverse effects 
would include increased numbers of malnourished people and 
impacts on smallholder farmers (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Just transitions are needed to address these effects. {5.5, 5.6, 5.7}
For adaptation and mitigation throughout the food system, 
enabling conditions need to be created through policies, 
markets, institutions, and governance (high confidence). 
For adaptation, resilience to increasing extreme events can be 
accomplished through risk sharing and transfer mechanisms such 
as insurance markets and index-based weather insurance (high 
confidence). Public health policies to improve nutrition – such as school 
procurement, health insurance incentives, and awareness-raising 
campaigns  – can potentially change demand, reduce healthcare 
costs, and contribute to lower GHG emissions (limited evidence, 
high agreement). Without inclusion of comprehensive food system 
responses in broader climate change policies, the mitigation and 
adaptation potentials assessed in this chapter will not be realised 
and food security will be jeopardised (high confidence). {5.7, 5.8}

1.1 
F raming and context 
The current food system (production, transport, processing, packaging, 
storage, retail, consumption, loss and waste) feeds the great majority 
of world population and supports the livelihoods of over 1 billion 
people. Agriculture as an economic activity generates between 1% 
and 60% of national GDP in many countries, with a world average 
of about 4% in 2017 (World Bank 2019). Since 1961, food supply per 
capita has increased more than 30%, accompanied by greater use of 
nitrogen fertiliser (increase of about 800%) and water resources for 
irrigation (increase of more than 100%). 
The rapid growth in agricultural productivity since the 1960s has 
underpinned the development of the current global food system that 
is both a major driver of climate change, and increasingly vulnerable 
to it (from production, transport, and market activities). Given the 
current food system, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization 
(FAO) estimates that there is a need to produce about 50% more 
food by 2050 in order to feed the increasing world population (FAO 
2018a). This would engender signifi cant increases in GHG emissions 
and other environmental impacts, including loss of biodiversity. 
FAO (2018a) projects that by 2050 cropland area will increase 
90–325  Mha, between  6% and 21% more than the 1567  Mha 
cropland area of 2010, depending on climate change scenario and 
development pathway (the lowest increase arises from reduced food 
loss and waste and adoption of more sustainable diets).
Climate change has direct impacts on food systems, food security, 
and, through the need to mitigate, potentially increases the 
competition for resources needed for agriculture. Responding to 
climate change through deployment of land-based technologies for 
negative emissions based on biomass production would increasingly 
put pressure on food production and food security through potential 
competition for land. 
Using a food system approach, this chapter addresses how climate 
change affects food security, including nutrition, the options for the 
food system to adapt and mitigate, synergies and trade-offs among 
these options, and enabling conditions for their adoption. The chapter 
assesses the role of incremental and transformational adaptation, 
and the potential for combinations of supply-side measures such as 
sustainable intensifi cation (increasing productivity per hectare) and 
demand-side measures (e.g., dietary change and waste reduction) to 
contribute to climate change mitigation.

Fi gure 5.1 |  Interlinkages between the climate system, food system, ecosystems (land, water and oceans) and socio-economic system. These systems 
operate at multiple scales, both global and regional. Food security is an outcome of the food system leading to human well-being, which is also indirectly linked with climate and 
ecosystems through the socio-economic system. Adaptation measures can help to reduce negative impacts of climate change on the food system and ecosystems. Mitigation 
measures can reduce GHG emissions coming from the food system and ecosystems.

1.1.1 
Food security and insecurity, the food system 
and climate change 
The food system encompasses all the activities and actors in the 
production, transport, manufacturing, retailing, consumption, and 
waste of food, and their impacts on nutrition, health and well-being, 
and the environment (Figure 5.1). 
1.1.1.1 
Food security as an outcome of the food system
The activities and the actors in the food system lead to outcomes such 
as food security and generate impacts on the environment. As part 
of the environmental impacts, food systems are a  considerable 
contributor to GHG emissions, and thus climate change (Section 5.4). 
In turn, climate change has complex interactions with food systems, 
leading to food insecurity through impacts on food availability, 
access, utilisation and stability (Table 5.1 and Section 5.2). 
We take a  food systems lens in the Special Report on Climate 
Change and Land (SRCCL) to recognise that demand for and supply 
of food are interlinked and need to be jointly assessed in order to 
identify the challenges of mitigation and adaptation to climate 
change. Outcomes cannot be disaggregated solely to, for example, 
agricultural production, because the demand for food shapes what 
is grown, where it is grown, and how much is grown. Thus, GHG 
emissions from agriculture result, in large part, from ‘pull’ from 
the demand side. Mitigation and adaptation involve modifying 
production, supply chain, and demand practices (through, for 
example, dietary choices, market incentives, and trade relationships), 
so as to evolve to a more sustainable and healthy food system. 
According to FAO (2001a), food security is a situation that exists 
when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic 
access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their 
dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. 
‘All people at all times’ implies the need for equitable and stable 
food distribution, but it is increasingly recognised that it also covers 
the need for inter-generational equity, and therefore ‘sustainability’ 
in food production. ‘Safe and nutritious food … for a healthy life’ 
implies that food insecurity can occur if the diet is not nutritious, 
including when there is consumption of an excess of calories, or if 
food is not safe, meaning free from harmful substances. 
A prime impact of food insecurity is malnourishment (literally ‘bad 
nourishment’) leading to malnutrition, which refers to deficiencies, 
excesses, or imbalances in a  person’s intake of energy and/or 
nutrients. As defined by FAO et al. (2018), undernourishment occurs 
when an individual’s habitual food consumption is insufficient to 
provide the amount of dietary energy required to maintain a normal, 
active, healthy life. In addition to undernourishment in the sense of 
insufficient calories  (‘hunger’), undernourishment occurs in terms 
of nutritional deficiencies in vitamins (e.g., vitamin A) and minerals 
(e.g.,  iron, zinc, iodine), so-called ‘hidden hunger’. Hidden hunger 
tends to be present in countries with high levels of undernourishment 
(Muthayya et al. 2013), but micronutrient deficiency can occur in 
societies with low prevalence of undernourishment. For example, 
in many parts of the world teenage girls suffer from iron deficiency 
(Whitfield et al. 2015) and calcium deficiency is common in 
Western-style diets (Aslam and Varani 2016). Food security is related 
to nutrition, and conversely food insecurity is related to malnutrition. 
Not all malnourishment arises from food insecurity, as households 
may have access to healthy diets but choose to eat unhealthily, or it 
may arise from illness. However, in many parts of the world, poverty 
is linked to poor diets (FAO et al. 2018). This may be through lack of 
resources to produce or access food in general, or healthy food, in 
particular, as healthier diets are more expensive than diets rich in 
calories but poor in nutrition (high confidence) (see meta-analysis by 
Darmon and Drewnowski 2015). The relationship between poverty 
and poor diets may also be linked to unhealthy ‘food environments,’ 
with retail outlets in a locality only providing access to foods of low 
nutritional quality (Gamba et al. 2015) – such areas are sometimes 
termed ‘food deserts’ (Battersby 2012). 
Whilst conceptually the definition of food security is clear, it is not 
straightforward to measure in a simple way that encompasses all 
its aspects. Although there are a range of methods to assess food 
insecurity, they all have some shortcomings. For example, the 
FAO has developed the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), 
a survey-based tool to measure the severity of overall households’ 
inability to access food. While it provides reliable estimates of the 
prevalence of food insecurity in a  population, it does not reveal 
whether actual diets are adequate or not with respect to all aspects 
of nutrition (Section 5.1.2.1).
1.1.1.2 
Effects of climate change on food security 
Climate change is projected to negatively impact the four pillars of 
food security – availability, access, utilisation and stability – and their 
interactions (FAO et al. 2018) (high confidence). This chapter assesses 
recent work since AR5 that has strengthened understanding of how 
climate change affects each of these pillars across the full range of 
food system activities (Table 5.1 and Section 5.2). 
While most studies continue to focus on availability via impacts 
on food production, more studies are addressing related issues of 
access (e.g.,  impacts on food prices), utilisation (e.g.,  impacts on 
nutritional quality), and stability (e.g., impacts of increasing extreme 
events) as they are affected by a  changing climate (Bailey et al. 
2015). Low-income producers and consumers are likely to be most 
affected because of a lack of resources to invest in adaptation and 
diversification measures (UNCCD 2017; Bailey et al. 2015).

1.1.2 
Status of the food system, food insecurity 
and malnourishment 
1.1.2.1 
Trends in the global food system 
Food is predominantly produced on land, with, on average, 83% 
of the 697 kg of food consumed per person per year, 93% of the 
2884 kcal per day, and 80% of the 81 g of protein eaten per day 
coming from terrestrial production in 2013 (FAOSTAT 2018).1 With 
increases in crop yields and production (Figure  5.2), the absolute 
supply of food has been increasing over the last five decades. Growth 
in production of animal-sourced food is driving crop utilisation for 
livestock feed (FAOSTAT 2018; Pradhan et al. 2013a). Global trade 
of crop and animal-sourced food has increased by around 5 times 
between 1961 and 2013 (FAOSTAT 2018). During this period, 
global food availability has increased from 2200  kcal/cap/day to 
2884 kcal/cap/day, making a transition from a food deficit to a food 
surplus situation (FAOSTAT 2018; Hiç et al. 2016). 
The availability of cereals, animal products, oil crops, and fruits 
and vegetables has mainly grown (FAOSTAT 2018), reflecting 
shifts towards more affluent diets. This, in general, has resulted 
in a  decrease in prevalence of underweight and an increase in 
prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults (Abarca-Gómez 
et al. 2017). During the period 1961–2016, anthropogenic GHG 
emissions associated with agricultural production has grown 
from  3.1  GtCO2-eq yr–1 to  5.8  GtCO2-eq yr–1 (Section  5.4.2 and 
Chapter 2). The increase in emissions is mainly from the livestock 
sector (from enteric fermentation and manure left on pasture), use of 
synthetic fertiliser, and rice cultivation (FAOSTAT 2018).

1.1.2.2 
Food insecurity status and trends
In addressing food security the dual aspects of malnutrition  – 
under-nutrition and micro-nutrient deficiency, as well as 
over-consumption, overweight, and obesity – need to be considered 
(Figure 5.2 (g) and Table 5.2 |  Global prevalence of various forms 
of malnutrition.5.2). The UN agencies’ State of Food Security and 
Nutrition 2018 report (FAO et al. 2018) and the Global Nutrition Report 
2017 (Development Initiatives 2017) summarise the global data. The 
State of Food Security report’s estimate for undernourished people 
on a global basis is 821 million, up from 815 million the previous 
year and 784 million the year before that. Previous to 2014/2015 the 
prevalence of hunger had been declining over the last three decades. 
The proportion of young children (under five) who are stunted (low 
height-for-age), has been gradually declining, and was 22% in 2017 
compared to 31% in 2012 (150.8 million, down from 165.2 million in 
2012). In 2017, 50.5 million children (7.5%) under five were wasted 
(low weight-for-height). Since 2014, undernutrition has worsened, 
particularly in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, south-eastern Asia and 
Western Asia, and recently Latin America. Deteriorations have been 
observed most notably in situations of conflict and conflict combined 
with droughts or floods (FAO et al. 2018). 
Regarding micronutrient deficiencies known as ‘hidden hunger’, 
reporting suggests a prevalence of one in three people globally (FAO 
2013a; von Grebmer et al. 2014; Tulchinsky 2010) (Table 5.2). In the 
last decades, hidden hunger (measured through proxies targeting 
iron, vitamin A, and zinc deficiencies) worsened in Africa, while it 
mainly improved in the Asia and Pacific regions (Ruel-Bergeron et al. 
2015). In 2016, 613 million women and girls aged 15 to 49 suffered

from iron deficiency (Development Initiatives 2018); in 2013, 28.5% 
of the global population suffered from iodine deficiency; and in 2005, 
33.3% of children under five and 15.3% of pregnant women suffered 
from vitamin A  deficiency, and 17.3% of the global population 
suffered from zinc deficiency (HLPE 2017). 
Globally, as the availability of inexpensive calories from commodity 
crops increases, so does per capita consumption of calorie-dense 
foods (Ng et al. 2014; NCD-RisC 2016a; Abarca-Gómez et al. 2017 and 
Doak and Popkin 2017). As a result, in every region of the world, the 
prevalence of obesity (body mass index >30 kg m–2) and overweight 
(body mass index range between normality [18.5–24.9] and obesity) 
is increasing. There are now more obese adults in the world than 
underweight adults (Ng et al. 2014; NCD-RisC 2016a; Abarca-Gómez 
et al. 2017 and Doak and Popkin 2017). In 2016, around two billion 
adults were overweight, including 678 million suffering from obesity 
(NCD-RisC 2016a; Abarca-Gómez et al. 2017). The prevalence of 
overweight and obesity has been observed in all age groups. 
Around 41 million children under five years and 340 million children 
and adolescents aged 5–19 years were suffering from overweight 
or obesity in 2016 (NCD-RisC 2016a; FAO et al. 2017; WHO 2015). 
In many high-income countries, the rising trends in children and 
adolescents suffering from overweight or obesity have stagnated 
at high levels; however, these have accelerated in parts of Asia and 
have very slightly reduced in European and Central Asian lower 
and middle-income countries (Abarca-Gómez et al. 2017; Doak and 
Popkin 2017; Christmann et al. 2009). 
There are associations between obesity and non-communicable 
diseases such as diabetes, dementia, inflammatory diseases (Saltiel 
and Olefsky 2017), cardiovascular disease (Ortega et al. 2016) and 
some cancers, for example, of the colon, kidney, and liver (Moley 
and Colditz 2016). There is a growing recognition of the rapid rise in 
overweight and obesity on a global basis and its associated health 
burden created through non-communicable diseases (NCD-RisC 
2016a; HLPE 2017). 
Analyses reported in FAO et al. (2018) highlight the link between 
food insecurity, as measured by the FIES scale, and malnourishment 
(medium agreement, robust evidence). This varies by malnourishment 
measure as well as country (FAO et al. 2018). For example, there is 
limited evidence (low agreement but multiple studies) that food 
insecurity and childhood wasting (i.e., or low weight for height) are 
closely related, but it is very likely (high agreement, robust evidence) 
that childhood stunting and food insecurity are related (FAO et al. 
2018). With respect to adult obesity there is robust evidence, with 
medium agreement, that food insecurity, arising from poverty 
reducing access to nutritious diets, is related to the prevalence of 
obesity, especially in high-income countries and adult females. An 
additional meta-analysis (for studies in Europe and North America) 
also finds a negative relationship between income and obesity, with 
some support for an effect of obesity causing low income (as well as 
vice versa) (Kim and von dem Knesebeck 2018).
As discussed in Section 5.1.1.1, different methods of assessing food 
insecurity can provide differential pictures. Of particular note is the 
spatial distribution of food insecurity, especially in higher-income 
countries. FAO et al. (2018) reports FIES estimates of severe food 
insecurity in Africa, Asia and Latin America of 29.8%, 6.9% and 9.8% 
of the population, respectively, but of  1.4% of the population 
(i.e., about 20 million in total; pro rata <5 million for US, <1 million 
for UK) in Europe and North America. However, in the USA, USDA 
estimates 40  million people were exposed to varying degrees of 
food insecurity, from mild to severe (overall prevalence about 12%) 
(Coleman-Jensen et al. 2018). In the UK, estimates from 2017 and 
2018 indicate about 4 million adults are moderately to severely food 
insecure (prevalence 8%) (End Hunger UK 2018; Bates et al. 2017). 
The UK food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, over a year in 2017/18, 
distributed 1,332,952 three-day emergency food parcels to people 
referred to the charity as being in food crisis. Furthermore, a 2003 
study in the UK (Schenker 2003) estimated that 40% of adults, and 
15% of children admitted to hospitals were malnourished, and that 
70% of undernourishment in the UK was unreported.
In total, more than half the world’s population are underweight 
or overweight (NCD-RisC 2017a), so their diets do not provide 
the conditions for ‘an active and healthy life’. This will be more 
compromised under the impacts of climate change by changing 
the availability, access, utilisation, and stability of diets of sufficient 
nutritional quality as shown in Table  5.2 and discussed in detail 
below (Section 5.2).
1.1.3 
Climate change, gender and equity
Throughout, the chapter considers many dimensions of gender and 
equity in regard to climate change and the food system (Box 5.1). 
Climate change impacts differ among diverse social groups depending 
on factors such as age, ethnicity, ability/disability, sexual orientation, 
gender, wealth, and class (high confidence) (Vincent and Cull 2014; 
Kaijser and Kronsell 2014). Poverty, along with socio-economic 
and political marginalisation, cumulatively put women, children 
and the elderly in a  disadvantaged position in coping with the 
adverse impacts of the changing climate (UNDP 2013; Skoufias 
et al. 2011). The contextual vulnerability of women is higher due 
to their differentiated relative power, roles, and responsibilities at 
the household and community levels (Bryan and Behrman 2013; 
Nelson et al. 2002). They often have a higher reliance on subsistence 
agriculture, which will be severely impacted by climate change 
(Aipira et al. 2017). 
Through impacts on food prices (Section 5.2.3.1) poor people’s food 
security is particularly threatened. Decreased yields can impact 
nutrient intake of the poor by decreasing supplies of highly nutritious 
crops and by promoting adaptive behaviours that may substitute 
crops that are resilient but less nutritious (Thompson et al. 2012; 
Lobell and Burke 2010). In Guatemala, food prices and poverty have 
been correlated with lower micronutrient intakes (Iannotti et al. 
2012). In the developed world, poverty is more typically associated 
with calorically-dense but nutrient-poor diets, obesity, overweight, 
and other related diseases (Darmon and Drewnowski 2015).
447
Food security 
Chapter 5

Rural areas are especially affected by climate change (Dasgupta et al. 
2014), through impacts on agriculture-related livelihoods and rural 
income (Mendelsohn et al. 2007) and through impacts on employment. 
Jessoe et al. (2018) using a 28-year panel on individual employment 
in rural Mexico, found that years with a high occurrence of heat lead 
to a reduction in local employment by up to 1.4% with a medium 
emissions scenario, particularly for wage work and non-farm labour, 
with impacts on food access. Without employment opportunities in 
areas where extreme poverty is prevalent, people may be forced to 
migrate, exacerbating potential for ensuing conflicts (FAO 2018a).
Finally, climate change can affect human health in other ways that 
interact with food utilisation. In many parts of the world where 
agriculture relies still on manual labour, projections are that heat 
stress will reduce the hours people can work, and increase their risk 
(Dunne et al. 2013). For example, Takakura et al. (2017) estimates that 
under RCP8.5, the global economic loss from people working shorter 
hours to mitigate heat loss may be 2.4–4% of GDP. Furthermore, as 
discussed by Watts et al. (2018); people’s nutritional status interacts 
with other stressors and affects their susceptibility to ill health 
(the ‘utilisation pillar’ of food security): so food-insecure people are 
more likely to be adversely affected by extreme heat, for example.
In the case of food price hikes, those more vulnerable are more 
affected (Uraguchi 2010), especially in urban areas (Ruel et al. 2010), 
where livelihood impacts are particularly severe for the individuals 
and groups that have scarce resources or are socially isolated (Revi 
et al. 2014; Gasper et al. 2011) (high confidence). These people often 
lack power and access to resources, adequate urban services and 
functioning infrastructure. As climate events become more frequent 
and intense, this can increase the scale and depth of urban poverty 
(Rosenzweig et al. 2018b). Urban floods and droughts may result in 
water contamination increasing the incidence of diarrhoeal illness in 
poor children (Bartlett 2008). In the near destruction of New Orleans 
by Hurricane Katrina, about 40,000 jobs were lost (Rosemberg 2010).
Box 5.1 |  Gender, food security and climate change
Differentiated impacts, vulnerability, risk perception, 
behaviours and coping strategies for climate change related 
to food security  derive from cultural (gendered) norms. 
That is, the behaviours, tasks, and responsibilities a society 
defines as ‘male’ or ‘female’, and the differential gendered 
access to resources (Paris and Rola-Rubzen 2018; Aberman 
and Tirado 2014; Lebel et al. 2014; Bee 2016). In many rural 
areas women often grow most of the crops for domestic 
consumption and are primarily  responsible for storing, 
processing, and preparing food; handling livestock; gathering 
food, fodder and fuelwood; managing domestic water supply; 
and providing most of the labour for post-harvest activities 
(FAO 2011a). They are mostly impacted through increased 
hardship, implications for household roles, and subsequent 
organisational responsibilities (Boetto and McKinnon 2013; 
Jost et al. 2016). Water scarcity can particularly affect women 
because they need to spend more time and energy to collect 
water, where they may be more exposed to physical and 
sexual violence (Sommer et al. 2015; Aipira et al. 2017). 
They may be forced to use unsafe water in the household 
increasing risk of water-borne diseases (Parikh 2009). 
Climate change also has differentiated gendered impacts on 
livestock-holders’ food security (McKune et al. 2015; Ongoro 
and Ogara 2012; Fratkin et al. 2004) (Supplementary Material 
Table SM5.1). 
Gender dimensions of the four pillars
Worldwide, women play a key role in food security (World 
Bank 2015) and the four pillars of food security have strong 
gender dimensions (Thompson 2018). In terms of food 
availability, women tend to have less access to productive 
resources, including land, and thus less capacity to produce 
food (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7). 
In terms of food access, gendered norms in how food is 
divided at mealtimes may lead to smaller food portions for 
women and  girls. Women’s intra-household inequity limits 
their ability to purchase food; limitations also include lack 
of women’s mobility impacting trips to the market and lack 
of decision-making within the household (Ongoro and Ogara 
2012; Mason et al. 2017; Riley and Dodson 2014). 
In terms of food utilisation, men, women, children and 
the elderly have different nutritional needs (e.g.,  during 
pregnancy or breast-feeding). 
In terms of food stability, women are more likely to 
be disproportionately affected by price spikes (Vellakkal 
et al. 2015; Arndt et al. 2016; Hossain and Green 2011; 
Darnton-Hill and Cogill 2010; Cohen and Garrett 2010; 
Kumar and Quisumbing 2013) because when food is scarce 
women reduce food consumption relative to other family 
members, although these norms vary according to age, 
ethnicity, culture, region, and social position, as well as by 
location in rural or urban areas (Arora-Jonsson 2011; Goh 
2012; Niehof 2016; Ongoro and Ogara 2012).
Integrating gender into adaptation
Women have their own capabilities to adapt to climate 
change. In the Pacific Islands, women hold critical 
knowledge on where  or  how to find clean water; which 
crops to grow in a  wet or dry season; how to preserve 
and store food and seeds ahead of approaching storms,

Box 5.1 (continued)
floods or droughts; and how to carry their families through 
the recovery months. They also play a  pivotal role in 
managing household finances and investing their savings 
in education, health, livelihoods, and other activities that 
assist their families to adapt and respond to climate effects 
(Aipira et al. 2017). Decreasing women’s capacity to adapt 
to the impacts of climate change also decreases that of the 
household (Bryan and Behrman 2013). 
However, gender norms and power inequalities also shape the 
ability of men, women, boys, girls and the elderly to adapt to 
climate risks (Rossi and Lambrou 2008). For example, women 
pastoralists in the Samburu district of Kenya cannot make 
decisions affecting their lives, limiting their adaptive capacity 
(Ongoro and Ogara 2012).
Participation in decision-making and politics, division of 
labour, resource access and control, and knowledge and 
skills (Nelson and Stathers 2009) are some of the barriers 
to adaptation. Women’s adaptive capacity is also diminished 
because their work often goes unrecognised (Rao 2005; 
Nelson and Stathers 2009). Many of women’s activities 
are not defined as ‘economically active employment’ in 
national accounts (FAO 2011a). This non-economic status 
of women’s activities implies that they are not included 
in wider discussions of priorities or interventions for climate 
change. Their perspectives and needs are not met; and 
thus, interventions, information, technologies, and tools 
promoted are potentially not relevant, and even can increase 
discrimination (Alston 2009; Edvardsson Björnberg and 
Hansson 2013; Huynh and Resurreccion 2014). 
Where gender-sensitive policies to climate change may 
exist, effective implementation in practice of gender equality 
and empowerment may not be achieved on the ground 
due to lack of technical capacity, financial resources and 
evaluation criteria,  as  shown in the Pacific Islands (Aipira 
et al. 2017). Thus, corresponding institutional frameworks 
that are well-resourced, coordinated, and informed are 
required, along with adequate technical capacity within 
government agencies, NGOs and project teams, to strengthen 
collaboration and promote knowledge sharing (Aipira et al. 
2017).
Women’s empowerment: Synergies among adaptation, 
mitigation, and food security
Empowering and valuing women in their societies increases 
their capacity to improve food security under climate change 
and make substantial contributions to their own well-being, 
to that of their families and of their communities (Langer et al. 
2015; Ajani et al. 2013 and Alston 2014) (high confidence). 
Women’s empowerment includes economic, social and 
institutional arrangements and may include targeting men in 
integrated agriculture programmes to change gender norms 
and improve nutrition  (Kerr et al. 2016). Empowerment 
through collective action and groups-based approaches in 
the near-term has the potential to equalise relationships 
on the local, national and global scale (Ringler et al. 2014). 
Empowered women are crucial to creating effective synergies 
among adaptation, mitigation, and food security. 
In Western Kenya, widows in their new role as main livelihood 
providers invested in sustainable innovations like rainwater 
harvesting systems and agroforestry (this can serve as 
both adaptation and mitigation), and worked together in 
formalised groups  of collective action (Gabrielsson and 
Ramasar 2013) to ensure food and water security. In Nepal, 
women’s empowerment had beneficial outcomes in maternal 
and children nutrition, reducing the negative effect of low 
production diversity (Malapit et al. 2015). Integrated nutrition 
and agricultural programmes have increased women’s 
decision-making power and control over home gardens in 
Burkina Faso (van den Bold et al. 2015) with positive impacts 
on food security. 
1.1.4 
Food systems in AR5, SR15, 
and the Paris Agreement 
Food, and its relationship to the environment and climate change, 
has grown in prominence since the Rio Declaration in 1992, where 
food production is Chapter 14 of Agenda 21, to the Paris Agreement 
of 2015, which includes the need to ensure food security under the 
threat of climate change on its first page. This growing prominence of 
food is reflected in recent IPCC reports, including its Fifth Assessment 
Report (IPCC 2014a) and the Special Report on global warming 
of 1.5°C (SR15) (IPCC 2018a).

1.1.4.1 
Food systems in AR5 and SR15
The IPCC Working Group (WG) II AR5 chapter on Food Security 
and Food Production Systems broke new ground by expanding its 
focus beyond the effects of climate change primarily on agricultural 
production (crops, livestock and aquaculture) to include a  food 
systems approach as well as directing attention to undernourished 
people (Porter et al. 2014). However, it focused primarily on food 
production systems due to the prevalence of studies on that 
topic (Porter et al. 2017). It highlighted that a  range of potential 
adaptation options exist across all food system activities, not just 
in food production, and that benefits from potential innovations 
in food processing, packaging, transport, storage, and trade were 
insufficiently researched at that time. 
The IPCC WG III AR5 chapter on Agriculture, Forestry and Other 
Land Use (AFOLU) (Smith et al. 2014) assessed mitigation potential 
considering not only the supply, but also the demand side of land uses, 
by consideration of changes in diets; it also included food loss and 
waste. AR5 focused on crop and livestock activities within the farm 
gate and land use and land-use change dynamics associated with 
agriculture. It did not take a full food system approach to emissions 
estimates that include processing, transport, storage, and retail.
The IPCC WG II AR5 Rural Areas chapter (Revi et al. 2014) found that 
farm households in developing countries are vulnerable to climate 
change due to socio-economic characteristics and non-climate 
stressors, as well as climate risks (Dasgupta et al. 2014). They also 
found that a wide range of on-farm and off-farm climate change 
adaptation measures are already being implemented and that the 
local social and cultural context played a  prominent role in the 
success or failure of different adaptation strategies for food security, 
such as trade, irrigation or diversification. The IPCC WG II AR5 Urban 
Areas chapter found that food security for people living in cities 
was severely affected by climate change through reduced supplies, 
including urban-produced food, and impacts on infrastructure, as well 
as a lack of access to food. Poor urban dwellers are more vulnerable 
to rapid changes of food prices due to climate change.
Many climate change response options in IPCC WG II and WG III 
AR5 (IPCC 2014b) address incremental adaptation or mitigation 
responses separately rather than being inclusive of more systemic or 
transformational changes in multiple food systems that are large-scale, 
in depth, and rapid, requiring social, technological, organisational 
and system responses (Rosenzweig and Solecki 2018; Mapfumo et al. 
2017; Termeer et al. 2017). In many cases, transformational change 
will require integration of resilience and mitigation across all parts of 
the food system including production, supply chains, social aspects, 
and dietary choices. Further, these transformational changes in the 
food system need to encompass linkages to ameliorative responses 
to land degradation (Chapter  4), desertification (Chapter  3), and 
declines in quality and quantity of water resources throughout the 
food-energy-water nexus (Chapter 2 and Section 5.7). 
The IPCC Special Report on global warming of  1.5°C found that 
climate-related risks to food security are projected to increase with 
global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C (IPCC 2018a). 
1.1.4.2 
Food systems and the Paris Agreement
To reach the temperature goal put forward in the Paris Agreement 
of limiting warming to well below 2°C, and pursuing efforts to 
limit warming to 1.5°C, representatives from 196 countries signed 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) in December 2015. The 
Agreement put forward a temperature target of limiting warming 
to well below 2°C, and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. 
Under the Paris Agreement, Parties are expected to put forward their 
best efforts through nationally determined contributions (NDCs) 
and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Article 2 of the 
Agreement makes clear the agreement is within ‘the context of 
sustainable development’ and states actions should be ‘in a manner 
that does not threaten food production’ to ensure food security. 
Many countries have included food systems in their mitigation and 
adaptation plans as found in their NDCs for the Paris Agreement 
(Rosenzweig et al. 2018a). Richards et al. (2015) analysed 160 Party 
submissions and found that 103 include agricultural mitigation; of 
the 113 Parties that include adaptation in their NDCs, almost all 
(102) include agriculture among their adaptation priorities. There 
is much attention to conventional agricultural practices that can be 
climate-smart and sustainable (e.g., crop and livestock management), 
but less to the enabling services that can facilitate uptake 
(e.g.,  climate information services, insurance, credit). Considerable 
finance is needed for agricultural adaptation and mitigation by the 
least developed countries – in the order of 3 billion USD annually for 
adaptation and 2 billion USD annually for mitigation, which may be 
an underestimate due to a small sample size (Richards et al. 2015). 
On the mitigation side, none of the largest agricultural emitters 
included sector-specific contributions from the agriculture sector in 
their NDCs, but most included agriculture in their economy-wide 
targets (Richards et al. 2018). 
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR). A  key aspect regarding the 
implementation of measures to achieve the Paris Agreement goals 
involves measures related to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) through 
bioenergy (Sections 5.5 and 5.6). To reach the temperature target 
of limiting warming to well below 2°C, and pursuing efforts to limit 
warming to  1.5°C, large investments and abrupt changes in land 
use will be required to advance bioenergy with carbon capture and 
sequestration (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation (AR), and 
biochar technologies. Existing scenarios estimate the global area 
required for energy crops to help limit warming to 1.5°C in the range 
of 109–990 Mha, most commonly around 380–700 Mha.
Most scenarios assume very rapid deployment between 2030 and 
2050, reaching rates of expansion in land use in  1.5°C scenarios 
exceeding 20  Mha yr–1, which are unprecedented for crops and 
forestry reported in the FAO database from 1961. Achieving 
the 1.5°C target would thus result in major competing demands for 
land between climate change mitigation and food production, with 
cascading impacts on food security.
This chapter assesses how the potential conflict for land could be 
alleviated by sustainable intensification to produce food with a lower 
450
Chapter 5

land footprint (Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Section 5.6). To accomplish 
this, farmers would need to produce the same amount of food with 
lower land requirement, which depends on technology, skills, finance, 
and markets. Achieving this would also rely on demand-side changes 
including dietary choices that enable reduction of the land footprint 
for food production while still meeting dietary needs. Transitions 
required for such transformative changes in food systems are 
addressed in Section 5.7.
1.1.4.3 
Charting the future of food security
This chapter utilises the common framework of the Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and the Shared Socio-economic 
Pathways (SSPs) (Popp et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017 and Doelman 
et al. 2018) to assess the impacts of future GHG emissions, mitigation 
measures, and adaptation on food security (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in 
Chapter 1, Sections 5.2 and 5.6). 
New work utilising these scenario approaches has shown that 
the food system externalises costs onto human health and the 
environment (Springmann et al. 2018a; Swinburn et al. 2019; Willett 
et al. 2019), leading to calls for transforming the food system to 
deliver better human and sustainability outcomes (Willett et al. 2019; 
IAP 2018; Development Initiatives 2018; Lozano et al. 2018). Such 
a transformation could be an important lever to address the complex 
interactions between climate change and food security. Through 
acting on mitigation and adaptation in regard to both food demand 
and food supply we assess the potential for improvements to both 
human health and the Sustainable Development Goals (Section 5.6). 
This chapter builds on the food system and scenario approaches 
followed by AR5 and its focus on climate change and food security, 
but new work since AR5 has extended beyond production to how 
climate change interacts with the whole food system. The analysis 
of climate change and food insecurity has expanded beyond 
undernutrition to include the over-consumption of unhealthy 
mass-produced food high in sugar and fat, which also threatens 
health in different but highly damaging ways, as well as the role 
of dietary choices and consumption in GHG emissions. It focuses 
on land-based food systems, though highlighting in places the 
contributions of freshwater and marine production. 
The chapter assesses new work on the observed and projected 
effects of CO2 concentrations on the nutritional quality of crops 
(Section  5.2.4.2) emphasising the role of extreme climate events 
(Section 5.2.5.1), social aspects including gender and equity (Box 5.1, 
and Cross-Chapter Box  11 in Chapter  7), and dietary choices 
(Section 5.4.6, 5.5.2). Other topics with considerable new literature 
include impacts on smallholder farming systems (Section  5.2.2.6), 
food loss and waste (Section  5.5.2.5), and urban and peri-urban 
agriculture (Section  5.6.5). The chapter explores the potential 
competing demands for land that mitigation measures to achieve 
temperature targets may engender, with cascading impacts on food 
production, food security, and farming systems (Section  5.6), and 
the enabling conditions for achieving mitigation and adaptation in 
equitable and sustainable ways (Section 5.7). Section 5.8 presents 
challenges to future food security, including food price spikes, 
migration, and conflict. 
1.2 
Impacts of climate change 
on food systems 
There are many routes by which climate change can impact food 
security and thus human health (Watts et al. 2018; Fanzo et al. 2017). 
One major route is via climate change affecting the amount of food, 
451
Food security 
Chapter 5

both from direct impacts on yields (Section  5.2.2.1) and indirect 
effects through climate change’s impacts on water availability and 
quality, pests and diseases (Section 5.2.2.3), and pollination services 
(Section 5.2.2.4). Another route is via changing CO2 in the atmosphere, 
affecting biomass and nutritional quality (Section  5.2.4.2). Food 
safety risks during transport and storage can also be exacerbated by 
changing climate (Section 5.2.4.1). 
Further, the direct impacts of changing weather can affect human 
health through the agricultural workforce’s exposure to extreme 
temperatures (Section 5.2.5.1). Through changing metabolic demands 
and physiological stress for people exposed to extreme temperatures, 
there is also the potential for interactions with food availability; 
people may require more food to cope, whilst at the same time being 
impaired from producing it (Watts et al. 2018). All these factors have 
the potential to alter both physical health as well as cultural health, 
through changing the amount, safety and quality of food available 
for individuals within their cultural context.
This section assesses recent literature on climate change impacts on 
the four pillars of food security: availability (Section 5.2.2), access 
(Section 5.2.3), utilisation (Section 5.2.4), and stability (Section 5.2.5). 
It considers impacts on the food system from climate changes that 
are already taking place and how impacts are projected to occur in 
the future. See Supplementary Material Section SM5.2 for discussion 
of detection and attribution and improvement in projection methods. 
1.2.1 
Climate drivers important to food security 
Climate drivers relevant to food security and food systems include 
temperature-related, precipitation-related, and integrated metrics 
that combine these and other variables. These are projected to 
affect many aspects of the food security pillars (FAO 2018b) (see 
Supplementary Material Table SM5.2, and Chapter 6 for assessment 
of observed and projected climate impacts). Climate drivers relevant 
to food production and availability may be categorised as modal 
climate changes (e.g., shifts in climate envelopes causing shifts in 
cropping varieties planted), seasonal changes (e.g., warming trends 
extending growing seasons), extreme events (e.g., high temperatures 
affecting critical growth periods, flooding/droughts), and atmospheric 
conditions for example, CO2 concentrations, short-lived climate 
pollutants (SLCPs), and dust. Water resources for food production will 
be affected through changing rates of precipitation and evaporation, 
ground water levels, and dissolved oxygen content (Cruz-Blanco et al. 
2015; Sepulcre-Canto et al. 2014; Huntington et al. 2017; Schmidtko 
et al. 2017). Potential changes in major modes of climate variability 
can also have widespread impacts such as those that occurred during 
late 2015 to early 2016 when a strong El Niño contributed to regional 
shifts in precipitation in the Sahel region. Significant drought across 
Ethiopia resulted in widespread crop failure and more than 10 million 
people in Ethiopia requiring food aid (U.S. Department of State 2016; 
Huntington et al. 2017) (Figure 5.3).
Other variables that affect agricultural production, processing, and/
or transport are solar radiation, wind, humidity, and (in coastal areas) 
salinisation and storm surge (Mutahara et al. 2016; Myers et al. 2017). 
Extreme climate events resulting in inland and coastal flooding, can 
affect the ability of people to obtain and prepare food (Rao et al. 2016; 
FAO et al. 2018). For direct effects of atmospheric CO2 concentrations 
on crop nutrient status see Section 5.2.4.2.

The important role of short-lived climate pollutants such as ozone and 
black carbon is increasingly emphasised since they affect agricultural 
production through direct effects on crops and indirect effects on 
climate (Emberson et al. 2018; Lal et al. 2017; Burney and Ramanathan 
2014; Ghude et al. 2014) (Chapters 2 and 4). Ozone causes damage to 
plants through damages to cellular metabolism that influence leaf-level 
physiology to whole-canopy and root-system processes and feedbacks; 
these impacts affect leaf-level photosynthesis senescence and carbon 
assimilation, as well as whole-canopy water and nutrient acquisition 
and ultimately crop growth and yield (Emberson et al. 2018). 
Using atmospheric chemistry and a  global integrated assessment 
model, Chuwah et al. (2015) found that without a large decrease 
in air pollutant emissions, high ozone concentration could lead to 
an increase in crop damage of up to 20% in agricultural regions in 
2050 compared to projections in which changes in ozone are not 
accounted for. Higher temperatures are associated with higher ozone 
concentrations; C3 crops are sensitive to ozone (e.g.,  soybeans, 
wheat, rice, oats, green beans, peppers, and some types of cottons) 
and C4 crops are moderately sensitive (Backlund et al. 2008).
Methane increases surface ozone which augments warming-induced 
losses and some quantitative analyses now include climate, long-lived 
(CO2) and multiple short-lived pollutants (CH4, O3) simultaneously 
(Shindell et al. 2017; Shindell 2016). Reduction of tropospheric 
ozone and black carbon can avoid premature deaths from outdoor 
air pollution and increases annual crop yields (Shindell et al. 2012). 
These actions plus methane reduction can influence climate on 
shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide reduction measures. 
Implementing them substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 
2°C threshold and contributes to achievement of the SDGs (Haines 
et al. 2017; Shindell et al. 2017).
1.2.2 
Climate change impacts on food availability 
Climate change impacts food availability through its effect on 
the production of food and its storage, processing, distribution, 
and exchange.
1.2.2.1 
Impacts on crop production
Observed impacts. Since AR5, there have been further studies that 
document impacts of climate change on crop production and related 
variables (Supplementary Material Table SM5.3). There have also 
been a  few studies that demonstrate a  strengthening relationship 
between observed climate variables and crop yields that indicate 
future expected warming will have severe impacts on crop production 
(Mavromatis 2015; Innes et al. 2015). At the global scale, Iizumi et al. 
(2018) used a counterfactual analysis and found that climate change 
between 1981 and 2010 has decreased global mean yields of maize, 
wheat, and soybeans by 4.1, 1.8 and 4.5%, respectively, relative to 
preindustrial climate, even when CO2 fertilisation and agronomic 
adjustments are considered. Uncertainties (90% probability interval) 
in the yield impacts are –8.5 to +0.5% for maize, –7.5 to +4.3% 
for wheat, and –8.4 to –0.5% for soybeans. For rice, no significant 
impacts were detected. This study suggests that climate change has 
modulated recent yields on the global scale and led to production 
losses, and that adaptations to date have not been sufficient to offset 
the negative impacts of climate change, particularly at lower latitudes. 
Dryland settlements are perceived as vulnerable to climate change 
with regard to food security, particularly in developing countries; 
such areas are known to have low capacities to cope effectively with 
decreasing crop yields (Shah et al. 2008; Nellemann et al. 2009). This 
is of concern because drylands constitute over 40% of the earth’s 
land area, and are home to 2.5 billion people (FAO et al. 2011).
Australia
In Australia, declines in rainfall and rising daily maximum 
temperatures based on simulations of 50 sites caused water-limited 
yield potential to decline by 27% from 1990 to 2015, even though 
elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations had a  positive effect 
(Hochman et al. 2017). In New South Wales, high-temperature 
episodes during the reproduction stage of crop growth were found 
to have negative effects on wheat yields, with combinations of low 
rainfall and high temperatures being the most detrimental (Innes 
et al. 2015). 
Asia
There are numerous studies demonstrating that climate change is 
affecting agriculture and food security in Asia. Several studies with 
remote sensing and statistical data have examined rice areas in 
north-eastern China, the northernmost region of rice cultivation, and 
found expansion over various time periods beginning in the 1980s, 
with most of the increase occurring after 2000 (Liu et al. 2014; Wang 
et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2017). Rice yield increases have also been 
found over a  similar period (Wang et al. 2014). Multiple factors, 
such as structural adjustment, scientific and technological progress, 
and government policies, along with regional warming (1.43°C in 
the past century) (Fenghua et al. 2006) have been put forward as 
contributing to the observed expanded rice areas and yield in the 
region. Shi et al. (2013) indicate that there is a partial match between 
climate change patterns and shifts in extent and location of the 
rice-cropping area (2000–2010). 
There have also been documented changes in winter wheat 
phenology in Northwest China (He 2015). Consistent with this finding, 
dates of sowing and emergence of spring and winter wheat were 
delayed, dates of anthesis and maturity was advanced, and length 
of reproductive growth period was prolonged from 1981–2011 in 
a study looking at these crops across China (Liu et al. 2018b). Another 
study looking in Northwest China demonstrated that there have been 
changes in the phenology and productivity of spring cotton (Huang 
and Ji 2015). A counterfactual study looking at wheat growth and 
yield in different climate zones of China from 1981–2009 found that 
impacts were positive in northern China and negative in southern 
China (Tao et al. 2014). Temperature increased across the zones while 
precipitation changes were not consistent (Tao et al. 2014).
Similar crop yield studies focusing on India have found that warming has 
reduced wheat yields by 5.2% from 1981 to 2009, despite adaptation

(Gupta et al. 2017), and that maximum daytime temperatures have 
risen along with some night-time temperatures (Jha and Tripathi 2017). 
Agriculture in Pakistan has also been affected by climate change. 
From 1980 to 2014, spring maize growing periods have shifted an 
average of  4.6 days per decade earlier, while sowing of autumn 
maize has been delayed 3.0 days per decade (Abbas et al. 2017). 
A  similar study with sunfl ower showed that increases in mean 
temperature from 1980 to 2016 were highly correlated with shifts in 
sowing, emergence, anthesis, and maturity for fall and spring crops 
(Tariq et al. 2018). 
Mountain people in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region encompassing 
parts of Pakistan, India, Nepal, and China, are particularly vulnerable 
to food insecurity related to climate change because of poor 
infrastructure, limited access to global markets, physical isolation, 
low productivity, and hazard exposure, including Glacial Lake 
Outburst Floods (GLOFs) (Rasul et al. 2019; Rasul 2010; Tiwari and 
Joshi 2012; Huddleston et al. 2003; Ward et al. 2013; FAO 2008; 
Nautiyal et al. 2007; Din et al. 2014). Surveys have been conducted to 
determine how climate-related changes have affected food security 
(Hussain et al. 2016; Shrestha and Nepal 2016) with results showing 
that the region is experiencing an increase in extremes, with farmers 
facing more frequent fl oods as well as prolonged droughts with 
ensuing negative impacts on agricultural yields and increases in food 
insecurity (Hussain et al. 2016; Manzoor et al. 2013). 
South America 
In another mountainous region, the Andes, inhabitants are also 
beginning to experience changes in the timing, severity, and patterns 
of the annual weather cycle. Data collected through participatory 
workshops, semi-structured interviews with agronomists, and 
qualitative fi eldwork from 2012 to 2014 suggest that in Colomi, 
Bolivia, climate change is affecting crop yields and causing farmers 
to alter the timing of planting, their soil management strategies, and 
the use and spatial distribution of crop varieties (Saxena et al. 2016). 
In Argentina, there has also been an increase in yield variability of 
maize and soybeans (Iizumi and Ramankutty 2016). These changes 
have had important implications for the agriculture, human health, 
and biodiversity of the region (Saxena et al. 2016). 
Africa 
In recent years, yields of staple crops such as maize, wheat, sorghum, 
and fruit crops, such as mangoes, have decreased across Africa, 
widening food insecurity gaps (Ketiem et al. 2017). In Nigeria, there 
have been reports of climate change having impacts on the livelihoods 
of arable crop farmers (Abiona et al. 2016; Ifeanyi-obi et al. 2016; 
Onyeneke 2018). The Sahel region of Cameroon has experienced an 
increasing level of malnutrition. This is partly due to the impact of 
climate change since harsh climatic conditions leading to extreme 
drought have a negative infl uence on agriculture (Chabejong 2016). 
Utilising farmer interviews in Abia State, Nigeria, researchers found 
that virtually all responders agreed that the climate was changing 
in their area (Ifeanyi-obi et al. 2016). With regard to management 
responses, a survey of farmers from Anambra State, Nigeria, showed 
that farmers are adapting to climate change by utilising such 
techniques as mixed cropping systems, crop rotation, and fertiliser 
application (Onyeneke et al. 2018). In Ebonyi State, Nigeria, Eze 
(2017) interviewed 160 women cassava farmers and found the major 
climate change risks in production to be severity of high temperature 
stress, variability in relative humidity, and fl ood frequency. 
Europe
The impacts of climate change are varied across the continent. Moore 
and Lobell (2015) showed via counterfactual analysis that climate 
trends are affecting European crop yields, with long-term temperature 
and precipitation trends since 1989 reducing continent-wide wheat 
and barley yields by 2.5% and 3.8%, respectively, and having slightly 
increased maize and sugar beet yields. Though these aggregate affects 
appear small, the impacts are not evenly distributed. In cooler regions 
such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, the effect of increased warming 
has been ameliorated by an increase in rainfall. Warmer regions, such

as Southern Europe, have suffered more from the warming; in Italy this 
effect has been amplified by a drying trend, leading to yield declines 
of 5% or greater. 
Another study examining the impacts of recent climate trends 
on cereals in Greece showed that crops are clearly responding to 
changes in climate – and demonstrated (via statistical analysis) that 
significant impacts on wheat and barley production are expected 
at the end of the 21st century (Mavromatis 2015). In the Czech 
Republic, a study documented positive long-term impacts of recent 
warming on yields of fruiting vegetables (cucumbers and tomatoes) 
from 4.9 to 12% per 1°C increase in local temperature, but decreases 
in yield stability of traditionally grown root vegetables in the warmest 
areas of the country (Potopová et al. 2017). A study in Hungary also 
indicated the increasingly negative impacts of temperature on crops 
and indicated that a warming climate is at least partially responsible 
for the stagnation in crop yields since the mid-1980s in Eastern 
Europe (Pinke and Lövei 2017). 
In summary, climate change is already affecting food security (high 
confidence). Recent  studies in both large-scale and smallholder 
farming systems document declines in crop productivity related to 
rising temperatures and changes in precipitation. Evidence for climate 
change impacts (e.g.,  declines and stagnation in yields, changes 
in sowing and harvest dates, increased infestation of pests and 
diseases, and declining viability of some crop varieties) is emerging 
from detection and attribution studies and ILK in Australia, Europe, 
Asia, Africa, North America, and South America (medium evidence, 
robust agreement). 
Projected impacts
Climate change effects have been studied on a global scale following 
a variety of methodologies that have recently been compared (Lobell 
and Asseng 2017; Zhao et al. 2017a and Liu et al. 2016). Approaches 
to study global and local changes include global gridded crop model 
simulations (e.g., Deryng et al. 2014), point-based crop model simulations 
(e.g., Asseng et al. 2015), analysis of point-based observations in the 
field (e.g., Zhao et al. 2016), and temperature-yield regression models 
(e.g., Auffhammer and Schlenker 2014). For an evaluation of model 
skills see example used in AgMIP (Müller et al. 2017b). 
Results from Zhao et al. (2017a) across different methods consistently 
showed negative temperature impacts on crop yield at the global scale, 
generally underpinned by similar impacts at country and site scales. 
A limitation of Zhao et al. (2017a) is that it is based on the assumption 
that yield responses to temperature increase are linear, while yield 
response differs depending on growing season temperature levels. 
Iizumi et al. (2017) showed that the projected global mean yields of 
maize and soybean at the end of this century do decrease monotonically 
with warming, whereas those of rice and wheat increase with warming 
but level off at about 3°C (2091–2100 relative to 1850–1900). 
Empirical statistical models have been applied widely to different 
cropping systems, at multiple scales. Analyses using statistical models 
for maize and wheat tested with global climate model scenarios found 
that the RCP4.5 scenario reduced the size of average yield impacts, 
risk of major slowdowns, and exposure to critical heat extremes 
compared to RCP8.5 in the latter decades of the 21st century (Tebaldi 
and Lobell 2018). Impacts on crops grown in the tropics are projected 
to be more negative than in mid – to high-latitudes as stated in 
AR5 and confirmed by recent studies (e.g., Levis et al. 2018). These 
projected negative effects in the tropics are especially pronounced 
under conditions of explicit nitrogen stress (Rosenzweig et al. 2014) 
(Figure 5.4).
Reyer et al. (2017b) examined biophysical impacts in five world 
regions under different warming scenarios: 1°C, 1.5°C, 2°C, and 4°C 
warming. For the Middle East and northern African region a significant 
correlation between crop yield decrease and temperature increase 
was found, regardless of whether the effects of CO2 fertilisation 
or adaptation measures are taken into account (Waha et al. 2017). 
For Latin America and the Caribbean the relationship between 
temperature and crop yield changes was only significant when the 
effect of CO2 fertilisation is considered (Reyer et al. 2017a). 
A review of recent scientific literature found that projected yield loss 
for West Africa depends on the degree of wetter or drier conditions 
and elevated CO2 concentrations (Sultan and Gaetani 2016). Faye 
et al. (2018b) in a crop modelling study with RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 found 
that climate change could have limited effects on peanut yield in 
Senegal due to the effect of elevated CO2 concentrations. 
Crop productivity changes for 1.5°C and 2.0°C. The IPCC Special 
Report on global warming of 1.5°C found that climate-related risks to 
food security are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C 
and increase further with 2°C (IPCC 2018b). These findings are based 
among others on Schleussner et al. (2018); Rosenzweig et al. (2018a); 
Betts et al. (2018), Parkes et al. (2018) and Faye et al. (2018a). The 
importance of assumptions about CO2 fertilisation was found to be 
significant by Ren et al. (2018) and Tebaldi and Lobell (2018). 
AgMIP coordinated global and regional assessment (CGRA) results 
confirm that at the global scale, positive and negative changes are 
mixed in simulated wheat and maize yields, with declines in some 
breadbasket regions, at both 1.5°C and 2.0°C (Rosenzweig et al. 2018a). 
In conjunction with price changes from the global economics models, 
productivity declines in the Punjab, Pakistan resulted in an increase in 
vulnerable households and poverty rate (Rosenzweig et al. 2018a).
Crop suitability. Another method of assessing the effects of 
climate change on crop yields that combined observations of current 
maximum-attainable yield with climate analogues also found strong 
reductions in attainable yields across a  large fraction of current 
cropland by 2050 (Pugh et al. 2016). However, the study found the 
projected total land area in 2050, including regions not currently 
used for crops, climatically suitable for a high attainable yield similar 
to today. This indicates that large shifts in land-use patterns and crop 
choice will likely be necessary to sustain production growth and keep 
pace with current trajectories of demand. 
Fruits and vegetables. Understanding the full range of climate 
impacts on fruits and vegetables is important for projecting future 
food security, especially related to dietary diversity and healthy diets. 
455
Food security 
Chapter 5

However, studies for vegetables are very limited (Bisbis et al. 2018). 
Of the 174 studies considered in a recent review, only 14 described 
results of fi eld or greenhouse experiments studying impacts of 
increased temperatures on yields of different root and leafy vegetables, 
tomatoes and legumes (Scheelbeek et al. 2018). Bisbis et al. (2018) 
found similar effects for vegetables as have been found for grain crops. 
That is, the effect of increased CO2 on vegetables is mostly benefi cial 
for production, but may alter internal product quality, or result in 
photosynthetic down-regulation. Heat stress reduces fruit set of 
fruiting vegetables, and speeds up development of annual vegetables, 
shortening their time for photoassimilation. Yield losses and impaired 
product quality result, thereby increasing food loss and waste. On the 
other hand, a longer growing season due to warmer temperatures 
enables a greater number of plantings and can contribute to greater 
annual yields. However, some vegetables, such as caulifl ower and 
asparagus, need a period of cold accumulation to produce a harvest 
and warmer winters may not provide those requirements.
For vegetables growing in higher baseline temperatures (>20°C), mean 
yield declines caused by 4°C warming were 31.5%; for vegetables 
growing in cooler environments (≤20°C), yield declines caused by 4°C 
were much less, on the order of about 5% (Scheelbeek et al. 2018). 
Rippke et al. (2016) found that 30–60% of the common bean growing 
area and 20–40% of the banana growing areas in Africa will lose viability 
in 2078–2098 with a global temperature increase of 2.6°C and 4°C 
respectively. Tripathi et al. (2016) found fruits and vegetable production 
to be highly vulnerable to climate change at their reproductive stages 
and also due to potential for greater disease pressure.
In summary, studies assessed fi nd that climate change will increasingly 
be detrimental to crop productivity as levels of warming progress 
(high confi dence). Impacts will vary depending on CO2 concentrations, 
fertility levels, and region. Productivity of major commodity crops 
as well as crops such as millet and sorghum yields will be affected.

1.2.2.2 
Impacts on livestock production systems
Livestock systems are impacted by climate change mainly through 
increasing temperatures and precipitation variation, as well as 
atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and a combination 
of these factors. Temperature affects most of the critical factors of 
livestock production, such as water availability, animal production 
and reproduction, and animal health (mostly through heat stress) 
(Figure 5.5). Livestock diseases are mostly affected by increases in 
temperature and precipitation variation (Rojas-Downing et al. 2017). 
Impacts of climate change on livestock productivity, particularly 
of mixed and extensive systems, are strongly linked to impacts on 
rangelands and pastures, which include the effects of increasing CO2 
on their biomass and nutritional quality. This is critical considering 
the very large areas concerned and the number of vulnerable people 
affected (Steinfeld 2010; Morton 2007). Pasture quality and quantity 
are mainly affected through increases in temperature and CO2, and 
precipitation variation. 
Among livestock systems, pastoral systems are particularly vulnerable 
to climate change (Dasgupta et al. 2014) (see Section  5.2.2.6 for 
impacts on smallholder systems that combine livestock and crops). 
Industrial systems will suffer most from indirect impacts leading 
to rises in the costs of water, feeding, housing, transport and the 
destruction of infrastructure due to extreme events, as well as an 
increasing volatility of the price of feedstuff which increases the level 
of uncertainty in production (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016b; Lopez-i-Gelats 
2014). Mixed systems and industrial or landless livestock systems 
could encounter several risk factors mainly due to the variability of 
grain availability and cost, and low adaptability of animal genotypes 
(Nardone et al. 2010). 
Considering the diverse typologies of animal production, from 
grazing to industrial, Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016b) distinguished impacts 
of climate change on livestock between those related to extreme 
events and those related to more gradual changes in the average of 
climate-related variables. Considering vulnerabilities, they grouped 
the impacts as those impacting the animal directly, such as heat and 
cold stress, water stress, physical damage during extremes; and others 
impacting their environment, such as modification in the geographical 
distribution of vector-borne diseases, location, quality and quantity of 
feed and water and destruction of livestock farming infrastructures. 
With severe negative impacts due to drought and high frequency of 
extreme events, the average gain of productivity might be cancelled 
by the volatility induced by increasing variability in the weather. 
For instance, semi-arid and arid pasture will likely have reduced 
livestock productivity, while nutritional quality will be affected by 
CO2 fertilisation (Schmidhuber and Tubiello 2007).
Observed impacts. Pastoralism is practiced in more than 75% of 
countries by between 200 and 500 million people, including nomadic 
communities, transhumant herders, and agropastoralists (McGahey 
et al. 2014). Observed impacts in pastoral systems reported in 
the literature include decreasing rangelands, decreasing mobility, 
decreasing livestock numbers, poor animal health, overgrazing, land 
degradation, decreasing productivity, decreasing access to water and 
feed, and increasing conflicts for the access to pasture land (high 
confidence) (López-i-Gelats et al. 2016; Batima et al. 2008; Njiru 2012; 
Fjelde and von Uexkull 2012; Raleigh and Kniveton 2012; Egeru 2016). 
Pastoral systems in different regions have been affected differently. 
For instance, in China changes in precipitation were a  more 
important factor in nomadic migration than temperature (Pei and 
Zhang 2014). There is some evidence that recent years have already 
seen an increase in grassland fires in parts of China and tropical Asia 
(IPCC 2012). In Mongolia, grassland productivity has declined by 
20–30% over the latter half of the 20th century, and ewe average 
weight reduced by 4 kg on an annual basis, or about 8% since 1980 
(Batima et al. 2008). Substantial decline in cattle herd sizes can be 
due to increased mortality and forced off-take (Megersa et al. 2014). 
Important, but less studied, is the impact of the interaction of grazing 
patterns with climate change on grassland composition. Spence et al. 
(2014) showed that climate change effects on Mongolia mountain 
steppe could be contingent on land use. 
Conflicts due to resource scarcity, as well as other socio-political 
factors (Benjaminsen et al. 2012) aggravated by climate change, 
has differentiated impact on women. In Turkana, female-headed 
households have lower access to decision-making on resource use 
and allocation, investment and planning (Omolo 2011), increasing 
their vulnerability (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7, Section 5.1.3).
Non-climate drivers add vulnerability of pastoral systems to climate 
change (McKune and Silva 2013). For instance, during environmental 
disasters, livestock holders have been shown to be more vulnerable 
to food insecurity than their crop-producing counterparts because of 
limited economic access to food and unfavourable market exchange 
rates (Nori et al. 2005). Sami reindeer herders in Finland showed 
reduced freedom of action in response to climate change due to 
loss of habitat, increased predation, and presence of economic and 
legal constraints (Tyler et al. 2007; Pape and Löffler 2012). In Tibet, 
emergency aid has provided shelters and privatised communally 
owned rangeland, which have increased the vulnerability of 
pastoralists to climate change (Yeh et al. 2014; Næss 2013). 
Projected impacts. The impacts of climate change on global 
rangelands and livestock have received comparatively less attention 
than the impacts on crop production. Projected impacts on grazing 
systems include changes in herbage growth (due to changes in 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations and rainfall and temperature 
regimes) and changes in the composition of pastures and in 
herbage quality, as well as direct impacts on livestock (Herrero et al. 
2016b). Droughts and high temperatures in grasslands can also be 
a predisposing factor for fire occurrence (IPCC 2012). 
Net primary productivity, soil organic carbon, and length of 
growing period. There are large uncertainties related to grasslands 
and grazing lands (Erb et al. 2016), especially in regard to net primary 
productivity (NPP) (Fetzel et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018). Boone et al. 
(2017) estimated that the mean global annual net primary production 
457
Food security 
Chapter 5

(NPP) in rangelands may decline by 10 gC m–2 yr–1 in 2050 under 
RCP8.5, but herbaceous NPP is likely to increase slightly (i.e., average 
of 3 gC m–2 yr–1) (Figure 5.6). Results of a similar magnitude were 
obtained by Havlík et al. (2015), using EPIC and LPJmL on a global 
basis. According to Rojas-Downing et al. (2017), an increase of 2°C is 
estimated to negatively impact pasture and livestock production in arid 
and semi-arid regions and positively impact humid temperate regions. 
Boone et al. (2017) identified significant regional heterogeneity in 
responses, with large increases in annual productivity projected in 
northern regions (e.g., a 21% increase in productivity in the USA and 
Canada) and large declines in western Africa (–46% in Sub-Saharan 
western Africa) and Australia (–17%). Regarding the length of growing 
period (LGP, average number of growing days per year) Herrero et al. 
(2016b) projected reductions in lower latitudes due to changes in rainfall 
patterns and increases in temperatures, which indicate increasing

limitations of water. They identified 35°C as a critical threshold for 
rangeland vegetation and heat tolerance in some livestock species. 
Rangeland composition. According to Boone et al. (2017), the 
composition of rangelands is projected to change as well (Chapter 3). 
Bare ground cover is projected to increase, averaging 2.4% across 
rangelands, with increases projected for the eastern Great Plains, 
eastern Australia, parts of southern Africa, and the southern Tibetan 
Plateau. Herbaceous cover declines are projected in the Tibetan 
Plateau, the eastern Great Plains, and scattered parts of the Southern 
Hemisphere. Shrub cover is projected to decline in eastern Australia, 
parts of southern Africa, the Middle East, the Tibetan Plateau, and the 
eastern Great Plains. Shrub cover could also increase in much of the 
Arctic and some parts of Africa. In mesic and semi-arid savannas south 
of the Sahara, both shrub and tree cover are projected to increase, 
albeit at lower productivity and standing biomass. Rangelands in 
western and south-western parts of the Isfahan province in Iran were 
found to be more vulnerable to future drying–warming conditions 
(Saki et al. 2018; Jaberalansar et al. 2017).
Soil degradation and expanding woody cover suggest that 
climate-vegetation-soil feedbacks catalysing shifts toward less 
productive, possibly stable states (Ravi et al. 2010) may threaten mesic 
and semi-arid savannas south of the Sahara (Chapters 3 and 4). This 
will also change their suitability for grazing different animal species; 
switches from cattle, which mainly consume herbaceous plants, to 
goats or camels are likely to occur as increases in shrubland occur.
Direct and indirect effects on livestock. Direct impacts of climate 
change in mixed and extensive production systems are linked to 
increased water and temperature stress on the animals potentially 
leading to animal morbidity, mortality and distress sales. Most 
livestock species have comfort zones between 10oC–30oC, and at 
temperatures above this animals reduce their feed intake 3–5% per 
additional degree of temperature (NRC 1981). In addition to reducing 
animal production, higher temperatures negatively affect fertility 
(HLPE 2012). 
Indirect impacts to mixed and extensive systems are mostly related 
to the impacts on the feed base, whether pastures or crops, leading 
to increased variability and sometimes reductions in availability and 
quality of the feed for the animals (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016b). Reduced 
forage quality can increase CH4 emissions per unit of gross energy 
consumed. Increased risk of animal diseases is also an important 
impact to all production systems (Bett et al. 2017). These depend on 
the geographical region, land-use type, disease characteristics, and 
animal susceptibility (Thornton et al. 2009). Also important is the 
interaction of grazing intensity with climate change. Pfeiffer et al. 
(2019) estimated that, in a scenario of mean annual precipitation 
below 500  mm, increasing grazing intensity reduced rangeland 
productivity and increased annual grass abundance. 
Pastoral systems. In Kenya, some 1.8 million extra cattle could be 
lost by 2030 because of increased drought frequency, the value of 
the lost animals and production foregone amounting to 630 million 
USD (Herrero et al. 2010). Martin et al. (2014) assessed impacts of 
changing precipitation regimes to identify limits of tolerance beyond 
which pastoral livelihoods could not be secured and found that 
reduced mean annual precipitation always had negative effects as 
opposed to increased rainfall variability. Similarly, Martin et al. (2016) 
found that drought effects on pastoralists in High Atlas in Morocco 
depended on income needs and mobility options (see Section 5.2.2.6 
for additional information about impacts on smallholder farmers). 
In summary, observed impacts in pastoral systems include changes 
in pasture productivity, lower animal growth rates and productivity, 
damaged reproductive functions, increased pests and diseases, and 
loss of biodiversity (high confidence). Livestock systems are projected 
to be adversely affected by rising temperatures, depending on the 
extent of changes in pasture and feed quality, spread of diseases, 
and water resource availability (high confidence). Impacts will 
differ for different livestock systems and for different regions (high 
confidence). Vulnerability of pastoral systems to climate change is 
very high (high confidence), and mixed systems and industrial or 
landless livestock systems could encounter several risk factors mainly 
due to variability of grain availability and cost, and low adaptability 
of animal genotypes. Pastoral system vulnerability is exacerbated by 
non-climate factors (land tenure issues, sedentarisation programmes, 
changes in traditional institutions, invasive species, lack of markets, 
and conflicts) (high confidence).
1.2.2.3 
Impacts on pests and diseases
Climate change is changing the dynamics of pests and diseases of 
both crops and livestock. The nature and magnitude of future changes 
is likely to depend on local agroecological and management context. 
This is because of the many biological and ecological mechanisms by 
which climate change can affect the distribution, population size, and 
impacts of pests and diseases on food production (Canto et al. 2009; 
Gale et al. 2009; Thomson et al. 2010; Pangga et al. 2011; Juroszek 
and von Tiedemann 2013; Bett et al. 2017). 
These mechanisms include changes in host susceptibility due to 
CO2 concentration effects on crop composition and climate stresses; 
changes in the biology of pests and diseases or their vectors 
(e.g., more generational cycles, changes in selection pressure driving 
evolution); mismatches in timing between pests or vectors and their 
‘natural enemies’; changes in survival or persistence of pests or 
disease pathogens (e.g., changes in crop architecture driven by CO2 
fertilisation and increased temperature, providing a more favourable 
environment for persistence of pathogens like fungi), and changes in 
pest distributions as their ‘climate envelopes’ shift. Such processes 
may affect pathogens, and their vectors, as well as plant, invertebrate 
and vertebrate pests (Latham et al. 2015). 
Furthermore, changes in diseases and their management, as well 
as changing habitat suitability for pests and diseases in the matrix 
surrounding agricultural fields, have the ability to reduce or exacerbate 
impacts (Bebber 2015). For example, changes in water storage and 
irrigation to adapt to rainfall variation have the potential to enhance 
disease vector populations and disease occurrence (Bett et al. 2017).
There is robust evidence that pests and diseases have already 
responded to climate change (Bebber et al. 2013), and many studies 
459
Food security 
Chapter 5
5
have now built predictive models based on current incidence of pests, 
diseases or vectors that indicate how they may respond in future 
(e.g., Caminade et al. 2015; Kim et al. 2015; Kim and Cho 2016; Samy 
and Peterson 2016; Yan et al. 2017). Warren et al. (2018) estimate that 
about 50% of insects, which are often pests or disease vectors, will 
change ranges by about 50% by 2100 under current GHG emissions 
trajectories. These changes will lead to crop losses due to changes 
in insect pests (Deutsch et al. 2018) and weed pressure (Ziska et al. 
2018), and thus affect pest and disease management at the farm 
level (Waryszak et al. 2018). For example, Samy and Peterson (2016) 
modelled bluetongue virus (BTV), which is spread by biting Culicodes 
midges, finding that the distribution of BTV is likely to be extended, 
particularly in Central Africa, the USA, and Western Russia. 
There is some evidence (medium confidence) that exposure will, on 
average, increase (Bebber and Gurr 2015; Yan et al. 2017), although 
there are a few examples where changing stresses may limit the range 
of a vector. There is also a general expectation that perturbations may 
increase the likelihood of pest and disease outbreaks by disturbing 
processes that may currently be at some quasi-equilibrium (Canto 
et al. 2009; Thomson et al. 2010; Pangga et al. 2011). However, in 
some places, and for some diseases, risks may decrease as well as 
increase (e.g., drying out may reduce the ability of fungi to survive) 
(Kim et al. 2015; Skelsey and Newton 2015), or tsetse fly’s range may 
decrease (Terblanche et al. 2008; Thornton et al. 2009). 
Pests, diseases, and vectors for both crop and livestock diseases are 
likely to be altered by climate change (high confidence). Such changes 
are likely to depend on specifics of the local context, including 
management, but perturbed agroecosystems are more likely, on 
theoretical grounds, to be subject to pest and disease outbreaks 
(low  confidence). Whilst specific changes in pest and disease 
pressure will vary with geography, farming system, pest/pathogen – 
increasing in some situations decreasing in others – there is robust 
evidence, with high agreement, that pest and disease pressures are 
likely to change; such uncertainty requires robust strategies for pest 
and disease mitigation.
1.2.2.4 
Impacts on pollinators
Pollinators play a key role on food security globally (Garibaldi et al. 
2016). Pollinator-dependent crops contribute up to 35% of global 
crop production volume and are important contributors to healthy 
human diets and nutrition (IPBES 2016). On a  global basis, some 
1500 crops require pollination (typically by insects, birds and bats) 
(Klein et al. 2007). Their importance to nutritional security is therefore 
perhaps under-rated by valuation methodologies, which, nonetheless, 
include estimates of the global value of pollination services at over 
225 billion USD2010 (Hanley et al. 2015). As with other ecosystem 
processes affected by climate change (e.g.,  changes in pests and 
diseases), how complex systems respond is highly context dependent. 
Thus, predicting the effects of climate on pollination services is 
difficult (Tylianakis et al. 2008; Schweiger et al. 2010) and uncertain, 
although there is limited evidence that impacts are occurring already 
(Section 5.2.2.4), and medium evidence that there will be an effect.
Pollination services arise from a mutualistic interaction between an 
animal and a plant – which can be disrupted by climate’s impacts on 
one or the other or both (Memmott et al. 2007). Disruption can occur 
through changes in species’ ranges or by changes in timing of growth 
stages (Settele et al. 2016). For example, if plant development responds 
to different cues (e.g., day length) from insects (e.g., temperature), 
the emergence of insects may not match the flowering times of 
the plants, causing a reduction in pollination. Climate change will 
affect pollinator ranges depending on species, life-history, dispersal 
ability and location. Warren et al. (2018) estimate that under a 3.2°C 
warming scenario, the existing range of about 49% of insects will 
be reduced by half by 2100, suggesting either significant range 
changes (if dispersal occurs) or extinctions (if it does not). However, 
in principle, ecosystem changes caused by invasions, in some cases, 
could compensate for the decoupling generated between native 
pollinators and pollinated species (Schweiger et al. 2010).
Other impacts include changes in distribution and virulence of 
pathogens affecting pollinators, such as the fungus Nosema cerana, 
which can develop at a higher temperature range than the less-virulent 
Nosema apis; increased mortality of pollinators due to higher frequency 
of extreme weather events; food shortage for pollinators due to 
reduction of flowering length and intensity; and aggravation of other 
threats, such as habitat loss and fragmentation (González-Varo et al. 
2013; Goulson et al. 2015; Le Conte and Navajas 2008; Menzel et al. 
2006; Walther et al. 2009; IPBES, 2016). The increase in atmospheric 
CO2 is also reducing the protein content of pollen, with potential 
impact on pollination population biology (Ziska et al. 2016). 
In summary, as with other complex agroecosystem processes 
affected by climate change (e.g., changes in pests and diseases), how 
pollination services respond will be highly context dependent. Thus, 
predicting the effects of climate on pollination services is difficult 
and uncertain, although there is medium evidence that there will be 
an effect.
1.2.2.5 
Impacts on aquaculture 
This report focuses on land-based aquaculture; for assessment 
of impacts on marine fisheries both natural and farmed see the 
IPCC Special Report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing 
climate (SROCC).
Aquaculture will be affected by both direct and indirect climate 
change drivers, both in the short and the long-term. Barange et al. 
(2018) provides some examples of short-term loss of production or 
infrastructure due to extreme events such as floods, increased risk of 
diseases, toxic algae and parasites; and decreased productivity due 
to suboptimal farming conditions. Long-term impacts may include 
scarcity of wild seed, limited access to freshwater for farming due 
to reduced precipitation, limited access to feeds from marine and 
terrestrial sources, decreased productivity due to suboptimal farming 
conditions, eutrophication and other perturbations.
FAO (2014a) assessed the vulnerability of aquaculture stakeholders 
to non-climate change drivers, which add to climate change hazards. 
Vulnerability arises from discrimination in access to inputs and

decision-making; conflicts; infrastructure damage; and dependence 
on global markets and international pressures. Other non-climate 
drivers identified by McClanahan et al. (2015) include: declining 
fishery resources; a  North–South divide in investment; changing 
consumption patterns; increasing reliance on fishery resources for 
coastal communities; and inescapable poverty traps created by 
low net resource productivity and few alternatives. In areas where 
vulnerability to climate change is heightened, increased exposure to 
climate change variables and impacts is likely to exacerbate current 
inequalities in the societies concerned, penalising further already 
disadvantaged groups such as migrant fishers (e.g., Lake Chad) or 
women (e.g., employees in Chile’s processing industry) (FAO 2014a).
In many countries the projected declines co-occur across both marine 
fisheries and agricultural crops (Blanchard et al. 2017), both of which 
will impact the aquaculture and livestock sectors (Supplementary 
Material Figure SM5.1). Countries with low Human Development 
Index, trade opportunities and aquaculture technologies are likely 
to face greater challenges. These cross-sectoral impacts point to the 
need for a more holistic account of the inter-connected vulnerabilities 
of food systems to climate and global change.
1.2.2.6 
Impacts on smallholder farming systems
New work has developed farming system approaches that take into 
account both biophysical and economic processes affected by climate 
change and multiple activities. Farm households in the developing 
world often rely on a complex mix of crops, livestock, aquaculture, 
and non-agricultural activities for their livelihoods (Rosenzweig 
and Hillel 2015; Antle et al. 2015). Across the world, smallholder 
farmers are considered to be disproportionately vulnerable to climate 
change because changes in temperature, rainfall and the frequency 
or intensity of extreme weather events directly affect their crop 
and animal productivity as well as their household’s food security, 
income and well-being (Vignola et al. 2015; Harvey et al. 2014b). For 
example, smallholder farmers in the Philippines, whose survival and 
livelihood largely depend on the environment, constantly face risks 
and bear the impacts of the changing climate (Peria et al. 2016).
Smallholder farming systems have been recognised as highly 
vulnerable to climate change (Morton, 2007) because they are highly 
dependent on agriculture and livestock for their livelihood (high 
confidence) (Dasgupta et al. 2014). In Zimbabwe, farmers were found 
vulnerable due to their marginal location, low levels of technology, 
and lack of other essential farming resources. Farmers observed high 
frequency and severity of drought; excessive precipitation; drying of 
rivers, dams and wells; and changes in timing and pattern of seasons 
as evidence of climate change, and indicated that prolonged wet, 
hot, and dry weather conditions resulted in crop damage, death of 
livestock, soil erosion, bush fires, poor plant germination, pests, lower 
incomes, and deterioration of infrastructure (Mutekwa 2009). 
In Madagascar, Harvey et al. (2014b) surveyed 600 small farmers 
and found that chronic food insecurity, physical isolation and 
lack of access to formal safety nets increased Malagasy farmers’ 
vulnerability to any shocks to their agricultural system, particularly 
extreme events. In Chitwan, Nepal, occurrence of extreme events and 
increased variability in temperature has increased the vulnerability 
of crops to biotic and abiotic stresses and altered the timing of 
agricultural operations; thereby affecting crop production (Paudel 
et al. 2014). In Lesotho, a study on subsistence farming found that 
food crops were the most vulnerable to weather, followed by soil 
and livestock. Climate variables of major concern were hail, drought 
and dry spells which reduced crop yields. In the Peruvian Altiplano, 
Sietz et al. (2012) evaluated smallholders’ vulnerability to weather 
extremes with regard to food security and found that resource 
scarcity (livestock, land area), diversification of activities (lack of 
alternative income, education deprivation) and income restrictions 
(harvest failure risk) shaped the vulnerability of smallholders. See 
Section 5.2.2.2 for observed impacts on smallholder pastoral systems.
Projected impacts. By including regional economic models, 
integrated methods take into account the potential for yield declines 
to raise prices and thus livelihoods (up to a certain point) in some 
climate change scenarios. Regional economic models of farming 
systems can be used to examine the potential for switching to other 
crops and livestock, as well as the role that non-farm income can 
play in adaptation (Valdivia et al. 2015 Antle et al. 2015). On the 
other hand, lost income for smallholders from climate change-related 
declines (for example, in coffee production), can decrease their food 
security (Hannah et al. 2017). 
Farming system methods developed by AgMIP (Rosenzweig 
et al. 2013) have been used in regional integrated assessments in 
Sub-Saharan Africa (Kihara et al. 2015), West Africa (Adiku et al. 
2015); East Africa (Rao et al. 2015), South Africa (Beletse et al. 2015), 
Zimbabwe (Masikati et al. 2015), South Asia (McDermid et al. 2015), 
Pakistan (Ahmad et al. 2015), the Indo-Gangetic Basin (Subash et al. 
2015), Tamil Nadu (Ponnusamy et al. 2015) and Sri Lanka (Zubair 
et al. 2015). The assessments found that climate change adds 
pressure to smallholder farmers across Sub-Saharan Africa and South 
Asia, with winners and losers within each area studied. Temperatures 
are expected to increase in all locations, and rainfall decreases are 
projected for the western portion of West Africa and southern Africa, 
while increases in rainfall are projected for eastern West Africa and 
all studied regions of South Asia. The studies project that climate 
change will lead to yield decreases in most study regions except 
South India and areas in central Kenya, as detrimental temperature 
effects overcome the positive effects of CO2. 
These studies use AgMIP representative agricultural pathways 
(RAPs) as a way to involve stakeholders in regional planning and 
climate resilience (Valdivia et al. 2015). RAPs are consistent with and 
complement the RCP/SSP approaches for use in agricultural model 
intercomparisons, improvement, and impact assessments. 
New methods have been developed for improving analysis of climate 
change impacts and adaptation options for the livestock component 
of smallholder farming systems in Zimbabwe (Descheemaeker et al. 
2018). These methods utilised disaggregated climate scenarios, as well 
as differentiating farms with larger stocking rates compared to less 
densely stocked farms. By disaggregating climate scenarios, impacts, 
and smallholder farmer attributes, such assessments can more 
effectively inform decision-making towards climate change adaptation.

In Central Asia, a study using the bio-economic farm model (BEFM) 
found large differences in projected climate change impact ranging 
from positive income gains in large-scale commercial farms in contrast 
to negative impacts in small-scale farms (Bobojonov and Aw-Hassan 
2014). Negative impacts may be exacerbated if irrigation water 
availability declines due to climate change and increased water demand 
in upstream regions. In Iran, changes in rainfall and water endowments 
are projected to significantly impact crop yield and water requirements, 
as well as income and welfare of farm families (Karimi et al. 2018).
Climate change impacts on food, feed and cash crops other than 
cereals, often grown in smallholder systems or family farms are less 
often studied, although impacts can be substantial. For example, 
areas suitable for growing coffee are expected to decrease by 21% 
in Ethiopia with global warming of  2.4°C (Moat et al. 2017) and 
more than 90% in Nicaragua (Läderach et al. 2017) with 2.2°C local 
temperature increase.
Climate change can modify the relationship between crops and 
livestock in the landscape, affecting mixed crop-livestock systems in 
many places. Where crop production will become marginal, livestock 
may provide an alternative to cropping. Such transitions could occur 
in up to 3% of the total area of Africa, largely as a result of increases 
in the probability of season failure in the drier mixed crop–livestock 
systems of the continent (Thornton et al. 2014). 
In Mexico, subsistence agriculture is expected to be the most 
vulnerable to climate change, due to its intermittent production 
and reliance on maize and beans (Monterroso et al. 2014). Overall, 
a decrease in suitability and yield is expected in Mexico and Central 
America for beans, coffee, maize, plantain and rice (Donatti et al. 
2018). Municipalities with a high proportional area under subsistence 
crops in Central America tend to have less resources to promote 
innovation and action for adaptation (Bouroncle et al. 2017).
In summary, smallholder farmers are especially vulnerable to 
climate change because their livelihoods often depend primarily on 
agriculture. Further, smallholder farmers often suffer from chronic 
food insecurity (high confidence). Climate change is projected to 
exacerbate risks of pests and diseases and extreme weather events 
in smallholder farming systems.
1.2.3 
Climate change impacts on access
Access to food involves the ability to obtain food, including the ability 
to purchase food at affordable prices. 
1.2.3.1 
Impacts on prices and risk of hunger
A protocol-based analysis based on AgMIP methods tested 
a combination of RCPs and SSPs to provide a range of projections for 
prices, risk of hunger, and land-use change (Hasegawa et al. 2018) 
(Figure  5.7 and Supplementary Material Table SM5.4.). Previous 
studies have found that decreased agricultural productivity will 
depress agricultural supply, leading to price increases. Despite 
different economic models with various representations of the global 
food system (Valin et al. 2014; Robinson et al. 2014; Nelson et al. 
2013; Schmitz et al. 2014), as well as having represented the SSPs in 
different ways, for example, technological change, land-use policies, 
and sustainable diets (Stehfest et al. 2019; Hasegawa et al. 2018), 
the ensemble of participating models projected a  1–29% cereal 
price increase in 2050 across SSPs 1, 2 and 3 due to climate change 
(RCP 6.0). This would impact consumers globally through higher food 
prices, though regional effects will vary. The median cereal price 
increase was 7%, given current projections of demand. In all cases 
(across SSPs and global economic models), prices are projected to 
increase for rice and coarse grains, with only one instance of a price 
decline  (–1%) observed for wheat in SSP1, with price increases 
projected in all other cases. Animal-sourced foods (ASFs) are also 
projected to see price increases (1%), but the range of projected 
price changes are about half those of cereals, highlighting that the 
climate impacts on ASFs will be felt indirectly, through the cost 
and availability of feed, and that there is significant scope for feed 
substitution within the livestock sector. 
Declining food availability caused by climate change is likely to 
lead to increasing food cost impacting consumers globally through 
higher prices and reduced purchasing power, with low-income 
consumers particularly at risk from higher food prices (Nelson et al. 
2010; Springmann et al. 2016a and Nelson et al. 2018). Higher prices 
depress consumer demand, which in turn will not only reduce energy 
intake (calories) globally (Hasegawa et al. 2015; Nelson et al. 2010; 
Springmann et al. 2016a and Hasegawa et al. 2018), but will also likely 
lead to less healthy diets with lower availability of key micronutrients 
(Nelson et al. 2018) and increase diet-related mortality in lower and 
middle-income countries (Springmann et al. 2016a). These changes will 
slow progress towards the eradication of malnutrition in all its forms. 
The extent that reduced energy intake leads to a heightened risk of 
hunger varies by global economic model. However, all models project 
an increase in the risk of hunger, with the median projection of an 
increase in the population at risk of insufficient energy intake by 6, 
14, and 12% in 2050 for SSPs 1, 2 and 3 respectively compared to 
a  no climate change reference scenario. This median percentage 
increase would be the equivalent of  8, 24 and 80  million (full 
range  1–183  million) additional people at risk of hunger due to 
climate change (Hasegawa et al. 2018).
1.2.3.2 
Impacts on land use
Climate change is likely to lead to changes in land use globally (Nelson 
et al. 2014; Schmitz et al. 2014 and Wiebe et al. 2015). Hasegawa et al. 
(2018) found that declining agricultural productivity broadly leads 
to the need for additional cropland, with 7 of 8 models projecting 
increasing cropland and the median increase by 2050 projected 
across all models of 2% compared to a no climate change reference 
(Figure 5.7). Not all regions will respond to climate impacts equally, 
with more uncertainty on regional land-use change across the model 
ensemble than the global totals might suggest. For example, the 
median land-use change for Latin America is an increase of cropland 
by 3%, but the range across the model ensemble is significant, with 
three models projecting declines in cropland (–25 to –1%) compared 
463
Food security 
Chapter 5

to the five models projecting cropland increase (0–5%). For further 
discussion on land-use change and food security see Section 5.6.
1.2.4 
Climate change impacts on food utilisation
Food utilisation involves nutrient composition of food, its 
preparation, and overall state of health. Food safety and quality 
affects food utilisation.
1.2.4.1 
Impacts on food safety and human health
Climate change can influence food safety through changing the 
population dynamics of contaminating organisms due to, for 
example, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, 
humidity, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather 
events, and changes in contaminant transport pathways. Changes in 
food and farming systems, for example, intensification to maintain 
supply under climate change, may also increase vulnerabilities as the 
climate changes (Tirado et al. 2010). 
Climate-related changes in the biology of contaminating organisms 
include changing the activity of mycotoxin-producing fungi, changing 
the activity of microorganisms in aquatic food chains that cause 
disease (e.g., dinoflagellates, bacteria like Vibrio), and increasingly 
heavy rainfall and floods causing contamination of pastures with 
enteric microbes (like Salmonella) that can enter the human food 
chain. Degradation and spoilage of products in storage and transport 
can also be affected by changing humidity and temperature outside 
of cold chains, notably from microbial decay but also from potential 
changes in the population dynamics of stored product pests 
(e.g., mites, beetles, moths) (Moses et al. 2015). 
Mycotoxin-producing fungi occur in specific conditions of temperature 
and humidity, so climate change will affect their range, increasing 
risks in some areas (such as mid-temperate latitudes) and reducing 
them in others (e.g., the tropics) (Paterson and Lima 2010). There 
is robust evidence from process-based models of particular species 
(Aspergillus/Aflatoxin B1, Fusarium/deoxynivalenol), which include 
projections of future climate that show that aflatoxin contamination 
of maize in Southern Europe will increase significantly (Battilani et al. 
2016), and deoxynivalenol contamination of wheat in Northwestern 
Europe will increase by up to three times current levels (van der 
Fels-Klerx et al. 2012b, a). 
Whilst downscaled climate models make any specific projection 
for a  given geography uncertain (Van der Fels-Klerx et al. 2013), 
experimental evidence on the small scale suggests that the combination 
of rising CO2 levels, affecting physiological processes in photosynthetic 
organisms, and temperature changes, can be significantly greater than 
temperature alone (Medina et al. 2014). Risks related to aflatoxins are 
likely to change, but detailed projections are difficult because they 
depend on local conditions (Vaughan et al. 2016).
Foodborne pathogens in the terrestrial environment typically come 
from enteric contamination (from humans or animals), and can 
be spread by wind (blowing contaminated soil) or flooding – the 
incidence of both of which are likely to increase with climate change 
(Hellberg and Chu 2016). Furthermore, water stored for irrigation, 
which may be increased in some regions as an adaptation strategy, 
can become an important route for the spread of pathogens (as well 
464
Chapter 5 
Food security

as other pollutants). Contaminated water and diarrheal diseases 
are acute threats to food security (Bond et al. 2018). Whilst there is 
little direct evidence (in terms of modelled projections) the results 
of a range of reviews, as well as expert groups, suggest that risks 
from foodborne pathogens are likely to increase through multiple 
mechanisms (Tirado et al. 2010; van der Spiegel et al. 2012; Liu et al. 
2013; Kirezieva et al. 2015; Hellberg and Chu 2016).
An additional route to climate change impacts on human health can 
arise from the changing biology of plants altering human exposure 
levels. This may include climate changing how crops sequester heavy 
metals (Rajkumar et al. 2013), or how they respond to changing 
pest pressure (e.g., cassava produces hydrogen cyanide as a defence 
against herbivore attack). 
All of these factors will lead to regional differences regarding food 
safety impacts (Paterson and Lima 2011). For instance, in Europe 
it is expected that most important food safety-related impacts 
will be mycotoxins formed on plant products in the field or during 
storage; residues of pesticides in plant products affected by changes 
in pest pressure; trace elements and/or heavy metals in plant 
products depending on changes in abundance and availability in 
soils; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in foods following changes 
in long-range atmospheric transport and deposition; and presence 
of pathogenic bacteria in foods following more frequent extreme 
weather, such as flooding and heat waves (Miraglia et al. 2009).
In summary, there is medium evidence, with high agreement that 
food utilisation via changes in food safety (and potentially food 
access from food loss) will be impacted by climate change, mostly by 
increasing risks, but there is low confidence, exactly how they may 
change for any given place.
1.2.4.2 
Impacts on food quality
There are two main routes by which food quality may change. First, 
the direct effects of climate change on plant and animal biology, such 
as through changing temperatures changing the basic metabolism 
of plants. Secondly, by increasing carbon dioxide’s effect on biology 
through CO2 fertilisation. 
Direct effects on plant and animal biology. Climate affects 
a  range of biological processes, including the metabolic rate in 
plants and ectothermic animals. Changing these processes can 
change growth rates, and therefore yields, but can also cause 
organisms to change relative investments in growth vs reproduction, 
and therefore change the nutrients assimilated. This may decrease 
protein and mineral nutrient concentrations, as well as alter lipid 
composition (DaMatta et al. 2010). For example, apples in Japan have 
been exposed to higher temperatures over 3–4 decades and have 
responded by blooming earlier. This has led to changes in acidity, 
firmness, and water content, reducing quality (Sugiura et al. 2013). 
In other fruit, such as grapes, warming-induced changes in sugar 
composition affect both colour and aroma (Mira de Orduña 2010). 
Changing heat stress in poultry can affect yield as well as meat 
quality (by altering fat deposition and chemical constituents), shell 
quality of eggs, and immune systems (Lara and Rostagno 2013). 
Effects of rising CO2 concentrations. Climate change is being 
driven by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide and other GHG’s 
in the atmosphere. As plants use CO2 in photosynthesis to form 
sugar, rising CO2 levels, all things being equal, enhances the process 
unless limited by water or nitrogen availability. This is known as 
‘CO2 fertilisation’. Furthermore, increasing CO2 allows stomata to 
partially close during gas exchange, reducing water loss through 
transpiration. These two factors affect the metabolism of plants, 
and, as with changing temperatures, affects plant growth rates, 
yields and their nutritional quality. Studies of these effects include 
meta-analyses, modelling, and small-scale experiments (Franzaring 
et al. 2013; Mishra and Agrawal 2014; Myers et al. 2014; Ishigooka 
et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2018; Loladze 2014 and Yu et al. 2014).
With regard to nutrient quality, a meta-analysis from seven Free-Air 
Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FACE), (with elevated atmospheric CO2 
concentration of 546–586 ppm) experiments (Myers et al. 2014), found 
that wheat grains had 9.3% lower zinc (CI 5.9–12.7%), 5.1% lower 
iron (CI 3.7–6.5%) and 6.3% lower protein (CI 5.2–7.5%), and rice 
grains had 7.8% lower protein content (CI 6.8–8.9%). Changes in 
nutrient concentration in field pea, soybean and C4 crops such as 
sorghum and maize were small or insignificant. Zhu et al. (2018) 
report a meta-analysis of FACE trials on a range of rice cultivars. They 
show that protein declines by an average of 10% under elevated 
CO2, iron and zinc decline by 8% and 5% respectively. Furthermore, 
a  range of vitamins show large declines across all rice cultivars, 
including B1  (–17%), B2  (–17%), B5  (–13%) and B9  (–30%), 
whereas vitamin E increased. As rice underpins the diets of many 
of the world’s poorest people in low-income countries, especially in 
Asia, Zhu et al. (2018) estimate that these changes under high CO2 
may affect the nutrient status of about 600 million people.
Decreases in protein concentration with elevated CO2 are related to 
reduced nitrogen concentration possibly caused by nitrogen uptake 
not keeping up with biomass growth, an effect called ‘carbohydrate 
dilution’ or ‘growth dilution’, and by inhibition of photorespiration 
which can provide much of the energy used for assimilating nitrate 
into proteins (Bahrami et al. 2017). Other mechanisms have also 
been postulated (Feng et al. 2015; Bloom et al. 2014; Taub and Wang 
2008). Together, the impacts on protein availability may take as many 
as 150 million people into protein deficiency by 2050 (Medek et al. 
2017). Legume and vegetable yields increased with elevated CO2 
concentration of 250 ppm above ambient by 22% (CI 11.6–32.5%), 
with a stronger effect on leafy vegetables than on legumes and no 
impact for changes in iron, vitamin C  or flavonoid concentration 
(Scheelbeek et al. 2018). 
Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 lower the content of 
zinc and other nutrients in important food crops. Dietary deficiencies 
of zinc and iron are a substantial global public health problem (Myers 
et al. 2014). An estimated two billion people suffer these deficiencies 
(FAO 2013a), causing a  loss of 63 million life-years annually 
(Myers et al. 2014). Most of these people depend on C3 grain legumes 
as their primary dietary source of zinc and iron. Zinc deficiency is 
currently responsible for large burdens of disease globally, and the 
populations who are at highest risk of zinc deficiency receive most of 
their dietary zinc from crops (Myers et al. 2015). The total number of

people estimated to be placed at new risk of zinc deficiency by 2050 
is 138 million. The people likely to be most affected live in Africa and 
South Asia, with nearly 48 million residing in India alone. Differences 
between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased 
sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address 
these new challenges to global health (Myers et al. 2014). 
In summary, while increased CO2 is projected to be beneficial for crop 
productivity at lower temperature increases, it is projected to lower 
nutritional quality (e.g., less protein, zinc, and iron) (high confidence). 
1.2.5 
Climate change impacts on food stability
Food stability is related to people’s ability to access and use food in 
a  steady way, so that there are not intervening periods of hunger. 
Increasing extreme events associated with climate change can disrupt 
food stability (see Section 5.8.1 for assessment of food price spikes).
1.2.5.1 
Impacts of extreme events
FAO et al. (2018) conducted an analysis of the prevalence of 
undernourishment (PoU) and found that in 2017, the average 
of the PoU was 15.4% for all countries exposed to climate extremes 
(Supplementary Material Figure SM5.2). At the same time, the PoU 
was 20% for countries that additionally show high vulnerability of 
agriculture production/yields to climate variability, or 22.4% for 
countries with high PoU vulnerability to severe drought. When there is 
both high vulnerability of agriculture production/yields and high PoU 
sensitivity to severe drought, the PoU is 9.8 points higher (25.2%). 
These vulnerabilities were found to be higher when countries had 
a high dependence on agriculture as measured by the number of 
people employed in the sector. Bangkok experienced severe flooding 
in 2011–2012 with large-scale disruption of the national food 
supply chains since they were centrally organised in the capital city 
(Allen et al. 2017).
The IPCC projects that frequency, duration, and intensity of some 
extreme events will increase in the coming decades (IPCC 2018a, 
2012). To test these effects on food security, Tigchelaar et al. (2018) 
showed rising instability in global grain trade and international 
grain prices, affecting especially the about 800 million people living 
in extreme poverty who are most vulnerable to food price spikes 
(Section 5.8.1). They used global datasets of maize production and 
climate variability combined with future temperature projections 
to quantify how yield variability will change in the world’s major 
maize-producing and exporting countries under 2°C and 4°C of 
global warming. 
Tesfaye et al. (2017) projected that the extent of heat-stressed 
areas in South Asia could increase by up to 12% in 2030 and 21% 
in 2050 relative to the baseline (1950–2000). Another recent study 
found that drier regions are projected to dry earlier, more severely 
and to a greater extent than humid regions, with the population of 
Sub-Saharan Africa most vulnerable (Lickley and Solomon 2018).

1.2.5.2 
Food aid
Food aid plays an important role in providing food security and 
saving lives after climate disasters. In 2015, 14.5  million people 
were assisted through disaster-risk reduction, climate change and/
or resilience building activities (WFP 2018). However, there is no 
agreement on how to better use emergency food aid, since it can 
come with unintended consequences for individuals, groups, regions, 
and countries (Barrett 2006). These may include negative dependency 
of food recipients (Lentz et al. 2005) or price increases, among others. 
Some authors state that tied food aid provided as ‘in kind’ by the 
donor country hampers local food production (Clay 2006), although 
others found no evidence of this (Ferrière and Suwa-Eisenmann 2015). 
Untied cash aid can be used to buy food locally or in neighbouring 
countries, which is cheaper and can contribute to improving the 
livelihoods of local farmers (Clay 2006). 
Ahlgren et al. (2014) found that food aid dependence of Marshall 
Islands due to climate change impacts can result in poor health 
outcomes due to the poor nutritional quality of food aid, which may 
result in future increases of chronic diseases. In this regard, Mary 
et al. (2018) showed that nutrition-sensitive aid can reduce the 
prevalence of undernourishment.
In summary, based on AR5 and SR15 assessments that the likelihood 
of extreme weather events will increase, (e.g., increases in heatwaves, 
droughts, inland flooding, and coastal flooding due to rising sea 
levels, depending on region) in both frequency and magnitude, 
decreases in food stability and thus increases in food insecurity will 
likely rise as well (medium evidence, high agreement). 
1.3 
Adaptation options, challenges 
and opportunities 
This section assesses the large body of literature on food system 
adaptation to climate change, including increasing extreme events, 
within a framework of autonomous, incremental, and transformational 
adaptation. It focuses primarily on regional and local considerations 
and adaptation options for both the supply side (production, storage, 
transport, processing, and trade) and the demand side (consumption 
and diets) of the food system. Agroecological, social, and cultural 
contexts are considered throughout. Finally, the section assesses the 
role of institutional measures at global, regional (multiple countries), 
national, and local scales and capacity-building.
1.3.1 
Challenges and opportunities
By formulating effective adaptation strategies, it is possible to reduce 
or even avoid some of the negative impacts of climate change on 
food security (Section  5.2). However, if unabated climate change 
continues, limits to adaptation will be reached (SR15). In the food 
system, adaptation actions involve any activities designed to reduce 
vulnerability and enhance resilience of the system to climate change. 
In some areas, expanded climate envelopes will alter agroecological 
zones, with opportunity for expansion towards higher latitudes 
and altitudes, soil and water resources permitting (Rosenzweig and 
Hillel 2015).
More extreme climatic events are projected to lead to more 
agrometeorological disasters with associated economic and social 
losses. There are many options for adapting the food system to 
extreme events reported in IPCC (2012), highlighting measures 
that reduce exposure and vulnerability and increase resilience, even 
though risks cannot fully be eliminated (IPCC 2012). Adaptation 
responses to extreme events aim to minimise damages, modify 
threats, prevent adverse impacts, or share losses, thus making the 
system more resilient (Harvey et al. 2014a). 
With current and projected climate change (higher temperature, 
changes in precipitation, flooding and extremes events), achieving 
adaptation will require both technological (e.g.,  recovering and 
improving orphan crops, new cultivars from breeding or biotechnology) 
and non-technological (e.g.,  markets, land management, dietary 
change) solutions. Climate interacts with other factors such as food 
supplied over longer distances and policy drivers (Mbow et al. 2008; 
Howden et al. 2007), as well as local agricultural productivity.
Given the site-specific nature of climate change impacts on food 
system components together with wide variation in agroecosystems 
types and management, and socio-economic conditions, it is widely 
understood that adaptation strategies are linked to environmental 
and cultural contexts at the regional and local levels (high 
confidence). Developing systemic resilience that integrates climate 
drivers with social and economic drivers would reduce the impact 
on food security, particularly in developing countries. For example, 
in Africa, improving food security requires evolving food systems to 
be highly climate resilient, while supporting the need for increasing 
yield to feed the growing population (Mbow et al. 2014b) (Box 5.2). 
Adaptation involves producing more food where needed, moderating 
demand, reducing waste, and improving governance (Godfray 
and  Garnett 2014) (see Section  5.6 for the significant synergies 
between adaptation and mitigation through specific practices, 
actions and strategies). 
Box 5.2 |  Sustainable solutions for food systems and climate change in Africa
Climate change, land-use change, and food security are 
important aspects of sustainability policies in Africa.

Food security 
Chapter 5
5
According to the McKinsey Global Institute (2010), Africa 
has around 60% of the global uncultivated arable land; 
thus the continent has a high potential for transformative 
change in food production. With short and long-term climate 
change impacts combined with local poverty conditions, 
land degradation and poor farming practices, Africa cannot 
grow enough food to feed its rapidly growing population. 
Sustainable improvement of productivity is essential, even as 
the impacts of climate change on food security in Africa are 
projected to be multiple and severe. 
Sustainable Land Management (SLM) of farming systems 
is important to address climate change while dealing with 
these daunting  food security needs and the necessity to 
improve access to nutritious food to maintain healthy and 
active lives in Africa (AGRA 2017). SLM has functions beyond 
the production of food, such as delivery of water, protection 
against disease (especially zoonotic diseases), the delivery of 
energy, fibre and building materials.
Commodity-based systems – driven by external markets – 
are increasing in Africa (cotton, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, 
groundnuts) with  important impacts on the use of land 
and climate. Land degradation, decreasing water resources, 
loss of biodiversity, excessive use of synthetic fertilisers 
and pesticides are some of the environmental challenges 
that influence preparedness to adapt  to climate change 
(Pretty and Bharucha 2015). A balanced strategy on African 
agriculture can be based on SLM and multifunctional 
land-use approaches combining food production, cash crops, 
ecosystem services, biodiversity conservation, ecosystem 
services delivery, and ILK. 
Box 5.2 (continued)
Thus, sustainable food systems in Africa entail multiple 
dimensions as shown in Figure 5.8.
With rapid urbanisation, it is important to integrate strategies 
(e.g., zero-carbon energy, smart irrigation systems, and climate- 
resilient agriculture) to minimise the negative effects of 
climate change while securing quality food for a  growing 
population.
Building resilience into productivity and production can 
be based on simultaneous attention to the following five 
overarching issues:
1. Closing 
yield 
gaps 
through 
adapted 
cultivars, 
sustainable land management combining production 
and preservation of  ecosystems essential functions, 
such as sustainable intensification approaches based 
on conservation agriculture and  community-based 
adaptation with functioning support services and market 
access (Mbow et al. 2014a). 
2. Identifying sustainable land management practices 
(agroecology, agroforestry, etc.) addressing different 
ecosystem services (food production, biodiversity, 
reduction of GHG emissions, soil carbon sequestration) 
for improved land-based climate change adaptation and 
mitigation (Sanz et al. 2017; Francis 2016).
3. Paying attention to the food-energy-water nexus,

especially water use and reutilisation efficiency but also 
management of rainwater (Albrecht et al. 2018).
4. Implementing institutional designs focused on youth 
and women through new economic models that help 
enable access to credit and loans to support policies that 
balance cash and food crops.
5. Building on local knowledge,  culture and traditions 
while seeking innovations for food waste reduction and 
transformation of agricultural products.
These aspects suppose both incremental and transformational 
adaptation that may stem from better infrastructure (storage 
and food processing), adoption of harvest and post-harvest 
technologies that minimise food waste, and development of 
new opportunities for farmers to respond to environmental, 
economic and social shocks that affect their livelihoods 
(Morton 2017).
Agriculture in Africa offers a  unique opportunity for 
merging adaption to and mitigation of climate change with 
sustainable production to ensure food security (CCAFS 2012; 
FAO 2012). Initiatives throughout the food system on both 
the supply and demand sides can lead to positive outcomes. 
1.3.2 
Adaptation framing and key concepts
1.3.2.1 
Autonomous, incremental, 
and transformational adaptation
Framing of adaptation in this section categorises and assesses 
adaptation 
measures 
as 
autonomous, 
incremental, 
and 
transformational (Glossary and Table 5.3). Adaptation responses can 
be reactive or anticipatory.
Autonomous. Autonomous adaptation in food systems does not 
constitute a conscious response to climatic stimuli but is triggered 
by changes in agroecosystems, markets, or welfare changes. It is also 
referred to as spontaneous adaptation (IPCC 2007). Examples of 
autonomous adaptation of rural populations have been documented 
in the Sahel (IRD 2017). In India, farmers are changing sowing and 
harvesting timing, cultivating short duration varieties, inter-cropping, 
changing cropping patterns, investing in irrigation, and establishing 
agroforestry. These are considered as passive responses or 
autonomous adaptation, because they do not acknowledge that 
these steps are taken in response to perceived climatic changes 
(Tripathi and Mishra 2017).
Incremental. Incremental adaptation maintains the essence and 
integrity of a system or process at a given scale (Park et al. 2012). 
Incremental adaptation focuses on improvements to existing 
resources and management practices (IPCC 2014a).
Transformational. Transformational adaptation changes the 
fundamental attributes of a  socio-ecological system either in 
anticipation of, or in response to, climate change and its impacts 
(IPCC 2014a). Transformational adaptation seeks alternative 
livelihoods and land-use strategies needed to develop new farming 
systems (Termeer et al. 2016). For example, limitations in incremental 
adaptation among smallholder rice farmers in Northwest Costa Rica 
led to a shift from rice to sugarcane production due to decreasing 
market access and water scarcity (Warner et al. 2015). Migration from 
the Oldman River Basin has been described as a transformational 
adaption to climate change in the Canadian agriculture sector 
(Hadarits et al. 2017). If high-end scenarios of climate change 
eventuate, the food security of farmers and consumers will depend 
on how transformational change in food systems is managed. 
An integrated framework of adaptive transition  – management 
of socio-technical transitions and adaptation to socio-ecological 
changes  – may help build transformational adaptive capacity 
(Mockshell and Kamanda 2018 and Pant et al. 2015). Rippke et al. 
(2016) has suggested overlapping phases of adaptation needed to 
support transformational change in Africa. 
1.3.2.2 
Risk management 
Climate risks affect all pillars of food security, particularly stability 
because extreme events lead to strong variation to food access. The 
notion of risk is widely treated in IPCC reports (IPCC 2014c) (see also 
Chapter 7 in this report). With food systems, many risks co-occur or 
reinforce each other, and this can limit effective adaptation planning as 
they require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering 
a range of drivers and scales. For example, from the understanding 
by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient 
markets that facilitate response strategies will require more than 
systemic reviews of risk factors (Howden et al. 2007). 
Integration of Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk 
Reduction (DRR) helps to minimise the overlap and duplication of 
projects and programmes (Nalau et al. 2016). Recently, countries 
started integrating the concept of DRR and CCA. For instance, 
the Philippines introduced new legislation calling for CCA and 
DRR integration, as current policy instruments had been largely 
unsuccessful in combining agencies and experts across the two areas 
(Leon and Pittock 2016). 
Studies reveal that the amplitude of interannual growing-season 
temperature variability is in general larger than that of long-term 
temperature change in many locations. Responding better to seasonal 
climate-induced food supply shocks therefore increases society’s 
capability to adapt to climate change. Given these backgrounds, 
seasonal crop forecasting and early response recommendations 
(based on seasonal climate forecasts), are emerging to strengthen 
existing operational systems for agricultural monitoring and 
forecasting (FAO 2016a; Ceglar et al. 2018 and Iizumi et al. 2018).
While adaptation and mitigation measures are intended to reduce 
the risk from climate change impacts in food systems, they can also 
be sources of risk themselves (e.g.,  investment risk, political risk) 
(IPCC 2014b). Climate-related hazards are a necessary element of 
risks related to climate impacts but may have little or nothing to do 
with risks related to some climate policies/responses.

Box 5.3 |  Climate change and indigenous food systems in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan Region
Diversification of production systems through promotion of Neglected and Underutilised Species (NUS; also known as 
understudied, neglected, orphan, lost or disadvantaged crops) offers adaptation opportunities to climate change, particularly in 
mountains. Neglected and Underutilised Species (NUS) have a potential to improve food security and at the same time help protect 
and conserve traditional knowledge and biodiversity. Scaling-up NUS requires training farmers and other stakeholders on ways to 
adopt adequate crop management, quality seed, select varieties, farming systems, soil management, development of new products, 
and market opportunities (Padulosi et al. 2013). Farmers in the Rasuwa district, in the mid-hills of Nepal, prefer to cultivate local 
bean, barley, millet and local maize, rather than commodity crops because they are more tolerant to water stress and extremely 
cold conditions (Adhikari et al. 2017). Farmers in the high-altitude, cold climate of Nepal prefer local barley with its short growing 
period because of a shorter growing window. Buckwheat is commonly grown in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region mainly 
because it grows fast and suppresses weeds. In Pakistan, quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) grew and produced well under saline 
and marginal soil where other crops would not grow (Adhikari et al. 2017).
At the same time, in many parts of the HKH region, a substantial proportion of the population is facing malnutrition. Various factors 
are responsible for this, and lack of diversity in food and nutrition resulting from production and consumption of few crops is one of 
them. In the past, food baskets in this region consisted of many different edible plant species, many of which are now neglected and 
underutilised. This is because almost all the efforts of the Green Revolution after 1960 focused on major crops. Four crops, namely rice, 
wheat, maize and potato, account for about 60% of global plant-derived energy supply (Padulosi et al. 2013). 
While the Green Revolution technologies substantially increased the yield of few crops and allowed countries to reduce hunger, 
they also resulted in inappropriate and excessive use of agrochemicals, inefficient water use, loss of beneficial biodiversity, water 
and soil pollution and significantly reduced crop and varietal diversity. With farming systems moving away from subsistence-based 
to commercial farming, farmers are also reluctant to grow these local crops because of low return, poor market value and lack of 
knowledge about their nutritional environmental value. 
However, transition from traditional diets based on local foods to a commercial crop-based diet with high fats, salt, sugar and 
processed foods, increased the incidence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, heart diseases and certain types 
of cancer (Abarca-Gómez et al. 2017; NCD-RisC 2016b, 2017b). This ‘hidden hunger’ – enough calories, but insufficient vitamins – 
is increasingly evident in mountainous communities including the HKH region.
Internationally, there is rising interest in NUS, not only because they present opportunities for fighting poverty, hunger and malnutrition, 
but also because of their role in mitigating climate risk in agricultural production systems. NUS play an important role in mountain 
agroecosystems because mountain agriculture is generally low-input agriculture, for which many NUS are well adapted. 
In the HKH region, mountains are agroecologically suitable for cultivation of traditional food crops, such as barley, millet, sorghum, 
buckwheat, bean, grams, taro, yam and a vast range of wild fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants. In one study carried out in two 
villages of mid-hills in Nepal, Khanal et al. (2015) reported 52 indigenous crop species belonging to 27 families with their various uses. 
Farming communities continue to grow various indigenous crops, albeit in marginal land, because of their value on traditional food 
and associated culture. Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) has identified a list of indigenous crops based on their nutritional, 
medicinal, cultural and other values. 
Many indigenous crops supply essential micronutrients to the human body, and need to be conserved in mountain food systems. 
Farmers in HKH region are cultivating and maintaining various indigenous crops such as Amaranthus, barley, black gram, horse gram, 
yam, and sesame. because of their nutritional value. Most of these indigenous crops are comparable with commercial cereals in terms 
of dietary energy and protein content, but are also rich in micronutrients. For example, pearl millet has higher content of calcium, iron, 
zinc, riboflavin and folic acid than rice or maize (Adhikari et al. 2017). 
NUS can provide both climate resilience and more options for dietary diversity to the farming communities of mountain ecosystems. Some 
of these indigenous crops have high medical importance. For example, mountain people in the HKH region have been using jammun 
(i.e., Syzygium cumini) to treat diabetes. In the Gilgit-Baltistan province of Pakistan, realising the importance of sea-buckthorn for 
nutritional and medicinal purposes, local communities have expanded its cultivation to larger areas. Many of these crops can be 
cultivated in marginal and/or fallow land which otherwise remains fallow. Most of these species are drought resistant and can 
be easily grown in rainfed conditions in non-irrigated land.

Adoption of agroecological practices could provide resilience for 
future shocks, spread farmer risk and mitigate the impact of droughts 
(Niles et al. 2018) (Section 5.3.2.3). Traditionally, risk management 
is performed through multifunctional landscape approaches in 
which resource utilisation is planned across wide areas and local 
agreements on resource access. Multifunctionality permits vulnerable 
communities to access various resources at various times and under 
various risk conditions (Minang et al. 2015). 
In many countries, governmental compensation for crop-failure and 
financial losses are used to protect against risk of severe yield reductions. 
Both public and private sector groups develop insurance markets and 
improve and disseminate index-based weather insurance programmes. 
Catastrophe bonds, microfinance, disaster contingency funds, and cash 
transfers are other available mechanisms for risk management. 
In summary, risk management can be accomplished through 
agroecological landscape approaches and risk sharing and transfer 
mechanisms, such as development of insurance markets and improved 
index-based weather insurance programmes (high confidence). 
1.3.2.3 
Role of agroecology and diversification
Agroecological systems are integrated land-use systems that maintain 
species diversity in a range of productive niches. Diversified cropping 
systems and practicing traditional agroecosystems of crop production 
where a wide range of crop varieties are grown in various spatial 
and temporal arrangements, are less vulnerable to catastrophic 
loss (Zhu et al. 2011). The use of local genetic diversity, soil organic 
matter enhancement, multiple-cropping or poly-culture systems, 
home gardening, and agroecological approaches can build resilience 
against extreme climate events (Altieri and Koohafkan 2008). 
However, Nie et al. (2016) argued that while integrated crop-livestock 
systems present some opportunities such as control of weeds, pests 
and diseases, and environmental benefits, there are some challenges, 
including yield reduction, difficulty in pasture-cropping, grazing, and 
groundcover maintenance in high rainfall zones, and development of 
persistent weeds and pests. 
Adaptation measures based on agroecology entail enhancement 
of agrobiodiversity; improvement of ecological processes and 
delivery of ecosystem services. They also entail strengthening of 
local communities and recognition of the role and value of ILK. Such 
practices can enhance the sustainability and resilience of agricultural 
systems by buffering climate extremes, reducing degradation of soils, 
and reversing unsustainable use of resources; outbreak of pests 
and diseases and consequently increase yield without damaging 
biodiversity. Increasing and conserving biological diversity such 
as soil microorganisms can promote high crop yields and sustain 
the environment (Schmitz et al. 2015; Bhattacharyya et al. 2016; 
Garibaldi et al. 2017).
Diversification of many components of the food system is a  key 
element for increasing performance and efficiency that may 
translate into increased resilience and reduced risks (integrated 
land management systems, agrobiodiversity, ILK, local food systems, 
dietary diversity, the sustainable use of indigenous fruits, neglected 
and underutilised crops as a  food source) (medium confidence) 
(Makate et al. 2016; Lin 2011; Awodoyin et al. 2015). 
The more diverse the food systems are, the more resilient they are 
in enhancing food security in the face of biotic and abiotic stresses. 
Diverse production systems are important for providing regulatory 
ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, 
soil erosion control, reduction of GHG emissions and control of 
hydrological processes (Chivenge et al. 2015). Further options 
for adapting to change in both mean climate and extreme events 
are livelihood diversification (Michael 2017; Ford et al. 2015), and 
production diversity (Sibhatu et al. 2015).

Crop diversification, maintaining local genetic diversity, animal 
integration, soil organic matter management, water conservation, 
and harvesting the role of microbial assemblages. These types of farm 
management significantly affect communities in soil, plant structure, 
and crop growth in terms of number, type, and abundance of species 
(Morrison-Whittle et al. 2017). Complementary strategies towards 
sustainable agriculture (ecological intensification, strengthening 
existing diverse farming systems and investment in ecological 
infrastructure) also address important drivers of pollinator decline 
(IPBES 2016).
Evidence also shows that, together with other factors, on-farm 
agricultural diversity can translate into dietary diversity at the farm 
level and beyond (Pimbert and Lemke 2018; Kumar et al. 2015; 
Sibhatu et al. 2015). Dietary diversity is important but not enough 
as an adaptation option, but results in positive health outcomes 
by increasing the variety of healthy products in people’s diets and 
reducing exposure to unhealthy environments. 
Locally developed seeds and the concept of seed sovereignty can both 
help protect local agrobiodiversity and can often be more climate 
resilient than generic commercial varieties (Wattnem 2016; Coomes 
et al. 2015; van Niekerk and Wynberg 2017; Vasconcelos et al. 2013). 
Seed exchange networks and banks protect local agrobiodiversity 
and landraces, and can provide crucial lifelines when crop harvests 
fail (Coomes et al. 2015; van Niekerk and Wynberg 2017; Vasconcelos 
et al. 2013).
Related to locally developed seeds, neglected and underutilised 
species (NUS) can play a key role in increasing dietary diversity (high 
confidence) (Baldermann et al. 2016; van der Merwe et al. 2016; 
Kahane et al. 2013; Muhanji et al. 2011) (Box 5.3). These species can 
also improve nutritional and economic security of excluded social 
groups, such as tribals (Nandal and Bhardwaj 2014; Ghosh-Jerath 
et al. 2015), indigent (Kucich and Wicht 2016) or rural populations 
(Ngadze et al. 2017). 
Dietary diversity has also been correlated (medium evidence, medium 
agreement) to agricultural diversity in small-holder and subsistence 
farms (Ayenew et al. 2018; Jones et al. 2014; Jones 2017; Pimbert 
and Lemke 2018), including both crops and animals, and has been 
proposed as a  strategy to reduce micronutrient malnutrition in 
developing countries (Tontisirin et al. 2002). In this regard, the 
capacity of subsistence farming to supply essential nutrients in 
reasonable balance to the people dependent on them has been 
considered as a means of overcoming their nutrient limitations in 
sound agronomic and sustainable ways (Graham et al. 2007). 
Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA). EbA is a set of nature-based 
methods addressing climate change adaptation and food security by 
strengthening and conserving natural functions, goods and services 
that benefit people. EbA approaches to address food security provide 
co-benefits such as contributions to health and improved diet, 
sustainable land management, economic revenue and water security. 
EbA practices can reduce GHG emissions and increase carbon storage 
(USAID 2017).
For example, agroforestry systems can contribute to improving food 
productivity while enhancing biodiversity conservation, ecological 
balance and restoration under changing climate conditions (Mbow 
et al. 2014a; Paudela et al. 2017; Newaj et al. 2016; Altieri et al. 2015). 
Agroforestry systems have been shown to reduce erosion through 
their canopy cover and their contribution to the micro-climate and 
erosion control (Sida et al. 2018). Adoption of conservation farming 
practices such as removing weeds from and dredging irrigation 
canals, draining and levelling land, and using organic fertilisation 
were among the popular conservation practices in small-scale paddy 
rice farming community of northern Iran (Ashoori and Sadegh 2016).
Adaptation potential of ecologically-intensive systems includes also 
forests and river ecosystems, where improved resource management 
such as soil conservation, water cycling and agrobiodiversity 
support the function of food production affected by severe climate 
change (Muthee et al. 2017). The use of non-crop plant resources 
in agroecosystems (permaculture, perennial polyculture) can improve 
ecosystem conservation and may lead to increased crop productivity 
(Balzan et al. 2016; Crews et al. 2018; Toensmeier 2016). 
In summary, increasing the resilience of the food system through 
agroecology and diversification is an effective way to achieve climate 
change adaptation (robust evidence, high agreement). Diversification 
in the food system is a  key adaptation strategy to reduce risks 
(e.g., implementation of integrated production systems at landscape 
scales, broad-based genetic resources, and heterogeneous diets) 
(medium confidence). 
1.3.2.4 
Role of cultural values
Food production and consumption are strongly influenced by cultures 
and beliefs. Culture, values and norms are primary factors in most 
climate change and food system policies. The benefits of integrating 
cultural beliefs and ILK into formal climate change mitigation 
and adaptation strategies can add value to the development of 
sustainable climate change, rich in local aspirations, planned with, 
and for, local people (Nyong et al. 2007). 
Cultural dimensions are important in understanding how societies 
establish food production systems and respond to climate 
change, since they help to explain differences in responses across 
populations to the same environmental risks (Adger et al. 2013). 
There is an inherent adaptability of indigenous people who are 
particularly connected to land use, developed for many centuries to 
produce specific solutions to particular climate change challenges. 
Acknowledging that indigenous cultures across the world are 
supporting many string strategies and beliefs that offer sustainable 
systems with pragmatic solutions will help move forward the food 
and climate sustainability policies. For instance, in the Sahel, the local 
populations have developed and implemented various adaptation 
strategies that sustain their resilience despite many threats (Nyong 
et al. 2007). There is an increased consideration of local knowledge 
and cultural values and norms in the design and implementation of 
modern mitigation and adaptation strategies.

There are some entrenched cultural beliefs and values that may be 
barriers to climate change adaptation. For instance, culture has been 
shown to be a major barrier to adaptation for the Fulbe ethnic group 
of Burkina Faso (Nielsen and Reenberg 2010). Thus, it is important 
to understand how beliefs, values, practices and habits interact with 
the behaviour of individuals and collectivities that have to confront 
climate change (Heyd and Thomas 2008). Granderson (2014) 
suggests that making sense of climate change and its responses at 
the community level demands attention to the cultural and political 
processes that shape how risk is conceived, prioritised and managed. 
For a  discussion of gender issues related to climate change, see 
Section 5.2.
Culturally sensitive risk analysis can deliver a better understanding 
of what climate change means for society (O’Brien and Wolf 
2010; Persson et al. 2015) and thus, how to better adapt. Murphy 
et al. (2016) stated that culture and beliefs play an important role 
in adaptive capacity but that they are not static. In the work done 
by Elum et al. (2017) in South Africa (about farmers’ perception of 
climate change), they concluded that perceptions and beliefs often 
have negative effects on adaptation options.
Culture is a  key issue in food systems and the relation of people 
with nature. Food is an intrinsically cultural process: food production 
shapes landscapes, which in turn are linked to cultural heritages and 
identities (Koohafkan and Altieri 2011; Fuller and Qingwen 2013), 
and food consumption has a strong cultural dimension. The loss of 
subsistence practices in modern cultures and their related ILK, has 
resulted in a loss of valuable adaptive capacities (Hernández-Morcillo 
et al. 2014). This is so because these systems are often characterised 
by livelihood strategies linked to the management of natural 
resources that have been evolved to reduce overall vulnerability to 
climate shocks (‘adaptive strategies’) and to manage their impacts 
ex-post (‘coping strategies’) (Morton 2007; López-i-Gelats et al. 2016).
1.3.3 
Supply-side adaptation
Supply-side adaptation takes place in the production (of crops, 
livestock, and aquaculture), storage, transport, processing, and trade 
of food. 
1.3.3.1 
Crop production
There are many current agricultural management practices that 
can be optimised and scaled up to advance adaptation. Among the 
often-studied adaptation options are increased soil organic matter, 
improved cropland management, increased food productivity, 
prevention and reversal of soil erosion (see Chapter  6  for 
evaluation of these practices in regard to desertification and land 
degradation). Many analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness 
of soil management and changing sowing date, crop type or variety 
(Waongo et al. 2015; Bodin et al. 2016; Teixeira et al. 2017; Waha 
et al. 2013; Zimmermann et al. 2017; Chalise and Naranpanawa 
2016; Moniruzzaman 2015; Sanz et al. 2017). Biophysical adaptation 
options also include pest and disease management (Lamichhane 
et al. 2015) and water management (Palmer et al. 2015; Korbeľová 
and Kohnová 2017).
In Africa, Scheba (2017) found that conservation agriculture 
techniques were embedded in an agriculture setting based on local 
traditional knowledge,  including crop rotation, no or minimum 
tillage, mulching, and cover crops. Cover cropping and no-tillage 
also improved soil health in a highly commercialised arid irrigated 
system in California’s San Joaquin Valley, USA (Mitchell et al. 2017). 
Biofertilisers can enhance rice yields (Kantachote et al. 2016), and 
Amanullah and Khalid (2016) found that manure and biofertiliser 
improve maize productivity under semi-arid conditions.
Adaptation also involves use of current genetic resources as well as 
breeding programmes for both crops and livestock. More drought, 
flood and heat-resistant crop varieties (Atlin et al. 2017; Mickelbart 
et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2017) and improved nutrient and water use 
efficiency, including overabundance as well as water quality (such 
as salinity) (Bond et al. 2018) are aspects to factor into the design 
of adaptation measures. Both availability and adoption of these 
varieties is a possible path for adaptation and can be facilitated by 
new outreach policy and capacity building. 
Water management is another key area for adaptation. Increasing 
water availability and reliability of water for agricultural production 
using different techniques of water harvesting, storage, and its 
judicious utilisation through farm ponds, dams, and community 
tanks in rainfed agriculture areas have been presented by Rao et al. 
(2017) and Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016a). In addition, improved drainage 
systems (Thiel et al. 2015), and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) 
techniques for rice cultivation (Howell et al. 2015; Rahman and 
Bulbul 2015) have been proposed. Efficient irrigation systems have 
been also analysed and proposed by Jägermeyr et al. (2016), Naresh 
et al. (2017), Gunarathna et al. (2017) and Chartzoulakis and Bertaki 
(2015). Recent innovation includes using farming systems with low 
usage of water such as drip-irrigation or hydroponic systems mostly 
in urban farming.
1.3.3.2 
Livestock production systems
Considering the benefits of higher temperature in temperate climates 
and the increase of pasture with incremental warming in some humid 
and temperate grasslands, as well as potential negative effects, 
can be useful in planning adaptation strategies to future climate 
change. Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016b) characterize adaptation for 
different livestock systems as managerial, technical, behavioural and 
policy-related options. Managerial included production adjustments 
(e.g.,  intensification, integration with crops, shifting from grazing 
to browsing species, multispecies herds, mobility, soil and nutrient 
management, water management, pasture management, corralling, 
feed and food storage, farm diversification or cooling systems); 
and changes in labour allocation (diversifying livelihoods, shifting 
to irrigated farming, and labour flexibility). Technological options 
included breeding strategies and information technology research. 
Behavioural options are linked to cultural patterns and included 
encouraging social collaboration and reciprocity, for example, 
473
Food security 
Chapter 5
5
livestock loans, communal planning, food exchanges, and information 
sharing. Policy options are discussed in Section 5.7 and Chapter 7.
1.3.3.3 
Aquaculture, fisheries, and agriculture interactions
Options may include livelihood diversification within and across 
sectors of fisheries, aquaculture and agriculture. Thus, adaptation 
options need to provide management approaches and policies that 
build the livelihood asset base, reducing vulnerability to multiple 
stressors with a  multi-sector perspective (Badjeck et al. 2010). In 
Bangladesh, fishing pressure on post-larval prawns has increased 
as displaced farmers have shifted to fishing following salt-water 
intrusion of agricultural land (Ahmed et al. 2013). In West Africa, 
strategies to cope with sudden shifts in fisheries are wider-reaching 
and have included turning to seafood import (Gephart et al. 2017) or 
terrestrial food production, including farming and bush-meat hunting 
on land (Brashares et al. 2004). 
Proposed actions for adaptation include effective governance, 
improved management and conservation, efforts to maximise 
societal and environmental benefits from trade, increased equitability 
of distribution and innovation in food production, and the continued 
development of low-input and low-impact aquaculture (FAO 2018c). 
Particular adaptation strategies proposed by FAO (2014a) include 
diverse and flexible livelihood strategies, such as introduction of fish 
ponds in areas susceptible to intermittent flood/drought periods; 
flood-friendly small-scale homestead bamboo pens with trap doors 
allowing seasonal floods to occur without loss of stocked fish; cage 
fish aquaculture development using plankton feed in reservoirs 
created by dam building; supporting the transition to different species, 
polyculture and integrated systems, allowing for diversified and 
more resilient systems; promotion of combined rice and fish farming 
systems that reduce overall water needs and provide integrated pest 
management; and supporting transitions to alternative livelihoods. 
Risk reduction initiatives include innovative weather-based insurance 
schemes being tested for applicability in aquaculture and fisheries 
and climate risk assessments introduced for integrated coastal zone 
management. For aquaculture’s contribution to building resilient food 
systems, Troell et al. (2014) found that aquaculture could potentially 
enhance resilience through improved resource use efficiencies and 
increased diversification of farmed species, locales of production, and 
feeding strategies. Yet, its high reliance on terrestrial crops and wild 
fish for feeds, its dependence on freshwater and land for culture sites 
and its environmental impacts reduce this potential. For instance, the 
increase in aquaculture worldwide may enhance land competition for 
feed crops, increasing price levels and volatility and worsening food 
insecurity among the most vulnerable populations.
1.3.3.4 
Transport and storage
Fewer studies have been done on adaptation of food system transport 
and storage compared to the many studies on adaptation to climate 
in food production. 
Transport. One transport example is found in Bangkok. Between 
mid-November 2011 and early January 2012, Bangkok, the capital 
city of Thailand, faced its most dramatic flood in approximately 
70  years with most transport networks cut-off or destroyed. This 
caused large-scale disruption of the national food supply chains 
since they were centrally organised in the capital city (Allen et al. 
2017). From this experience, the construction and management of 
‘climate-proof’ rural roads and transport networks is argued as one 
the most important adaptation strategies for climate change and 
food security in Thailand (Rattanachot et al. 2015). 
Similarly in Africa, it has been shown that enhanced transportation 
networks combined with other measures could reduce the impact of 
climate change on food and nutrition security (Brown et al. 2017b). 
This suggests that strengthening infrastructure and logistics for 
transport would significantly enhance resilience to climate change, 
while improving food and nutrition security in developing counties. 
Storage. Storage refers to both structures and technologies for 
storing seed as well as produce. Predominant storage methods used 
in Uganda are single-layer woven polypropylene bags (popularly 
called ‘kavera’ locally), chemical insecticides and granaries. Evidence 
from Omotilewa et al. (2018) showed that the introduction of new 
storage technology called Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) could 
contribute to climate change adaptation. PICS is a  chemical-free 
airtight triple-layered technology consisting of two high-density 
polyethylene inner liners and one outer layer of woven polypropylene 
bag. Its adoption has increased the number of households planting 
hybrid maize varieties that are more susceptible to insect pests in 
storage than traditional lower-yielding varieties. Such innovations 
could help to protect crops more safely and for longer periods from 
postharvest insect pests that are projected to increase as result of 
climate change, thus contributing to food security. 
In the Indo-Gangetic Plain many different storage structures based 
on ILK provide reliable and low-cost options made of local materials. 
For example, elevated grain stores protectharvested cereals from 
floods, but also provide for air circulation to prevent rot and to 
control insects and other vermin (Rivera-Ferre et al. 2013).
1.3.3.5 
Trade and processing
Adaptation measures are also being considered in trade, processing 
and packaging, other important components of the food system. 
These will enable availability, stability, and safety of food under 
changing climate conditions. 
Trade. Brooks and Matthews (2015) found that food trade increases 
the availability of food by enabling products to flow from surplus to 
deficit areas, raises incomes and favours access to food, improves 
utilisation by increasing the diversity of national diets while pooling 
production risks across individual markets to maintain stability. 
Processing. Growth of spoilage bacteria of red meat and poultry 
during storage due to increasing temperature has been demonstrated 
by European Food Safety Authority (EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards 
2016). In a  recent experiment conducted on the optimisation of 
474
Chapter 5 
Food security
5
processing conditions of Chinese traditional smoke-cured bacon, 
Larou, Liu et al. (2018a) showed that the use of a new natural coating 
solution composed of lysozyme, sodium alginate, and chitosan during 
the storage period resulted in 99.69% rate of reducing deterioration 
after 30-day storage. Also, the use of High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) 
technology to inactivate pathogenic, spoilage microorganisms and 
enzymes (with little or no effects on the nutritional and sensory 
quality of foods) have been described by Wang et al. (2016) and Ali 
et al. (2018) as new advances in processing and packaging fruits, 
vegetables, meats, seafood, dairy, and egg products. 
In summary, there are many practices that can be optimised and 
scaled up to advance supply-side adaptation. On-farm adaptation 
options include increased soil organic matter and erosion control 
in cropland, improved livestock and grazing land management, and 
transition to different species, polyculture and integrated systems 
in aquaculture. Crop and livestock genetic improvements include 
tolerance to heat, drought, and pests and diseases. Food transport, 
storage, trade, and processing will likely play increasingly important 
roles in adapting to climate change-induced food insecurity.
1.3.4 
Demand-side adaptation
Adaptation in the demand side of the food system involves 
consumption practices, diets, and reducing food loss and waste. Recent 
studies showed that supply-side adaptation measures alone will not 
be sufficient to sustainably achieve food security under climate change 
(Springmann et al. 2018b; Swinburn et al. 2019; Bajželj et al. 2014). 
As noted by Godfray (2015), people with higher income demand 
more varied diets, and typically ones that are richer in meat and 
other food types that require more resources to produce. Therefore, 
both supply-side (production, processing, transport, and trade) and 
demand-side solutions (for example, changing diets, food loss and 
waste reduction) can be effective in adapting to climate change 
(Creutzig et al. 2016) (see Section 5.5.2.5 for food loss and waste). 
The implications of dietary choice can have severe consequences for 
land. For example, Alexander et al. (2016), found that if every country 
were to adopt the UK’s 2011 average diet and meat consumption, 95% 
of global habitable land area would be needed for agriculture – up from 
50% of land currently used. For the average USA diet, 178% of global 
land would be needed (relative to 2011) (Alexander et al. 2016); and 
for ‘business as usual’ dietary trends and existing rates of improvement 
in yields, 55% more land would be needed above baseline (2009) 
(Bajželj et al. 2014). Changing dietary habits have been suggested as 
an effective food route to affect land use (Beheshti et al. 2017) and 
promote adaptation to climate change through food demand. 
Most literature has focused on demand-side options that analyse the 
effects on climate change mitigation by dietary changes. Little focus 
has been brought on demand-side adaptation measures to adjust 
the demand to the food challenges related to drivers such as market, 
climate change, inputs limitations (for example, fossil fuels, nitrogen, 
phosphorus), food access, and quality. Adding to that, the high 
cost of nutritious foods contributes to a higher risk of overweight 
and obesity (FAO 2018d). Adaptation measures relate also to the 
implications of easy access to inexpensive, high-calorie, low-nutrition 
foods which have been shown to lead to malnutrition (Section 5.1). 
Therefore, adaptation related to diet may be weighed against the 
negative side effects on health of current food choices. 
Reduction in the demand for animal-based food products and 
increasing proportions of plant-based foods in diets, particularly 
pulses and nuts; and replacing red meat with other more efficient 
protein sources are demand-side adaptation measures (Machovina 
et al. 2015) (Section 5.5.2). For example, replacing beef in the USA 
diet with poultry can meet caloric and protein demands of about 120 
to 140 million additional people consuming the average American 
diet (Shepon et al. 2016). Similar suggestions are made for adopting 
the benefits of moving to plant-based protein, such as beans (Harwatt 
et al. 2017). 
The main reason why reducing meat consumption is an adaptation 
measure is because it reduces pressure on land and water and thus 
our vulnerability to climate change and inputs limitations (Vanham 
et al. 2013). For animal feed, ruminants can have positive ecological 
effects (species diversity, soil carbon) if they are fed extensively on 
existing grasslands. Similarly, reducing waste at all points along 
the entire food chain is a  significant opportunity for improving 
demand-side adaptation measures (Godfray 2015). 
It is important to highlight the opportunities for improving the 
feed-to-meat conversion considered as a form of food loss. However, 
the unique capacity of ruminants to produce high-quality food from 
low-quality forage, in particular from landscapes that cannot be 
cropped and from cellulosic biomass that humans cannot digest 
could be seen as an effective way to improve the feed:meat ratio 
(Cawthorn and Hoffman 2015). 
In summary, there is potential for demand-side adaptation, such as 
adoption of diets low in animal-sourced products, in conjunction with 
reduction in food loss and waste to contribute to reduction in food 
demand, land sparing, and thus need for adaptation. 
1.3.5 
Institutional measures
To facilitate the scaling up of adaptation throughout the food system, 
institutional measures are needed at global, regional, national, and 
local levels (Section  5.7). Institutional aspects, including policies 
and laws, depend on scale and context. International institutions 
(financial and policies) are driving many aspects of global food 
systems (for example, UN agencies, international private sector 
agribusinesses and retailers). Many others operate at local level and 
strongly influence livelihoods and markets of smallholder farmers. 
Hence, differentiation in the roles of the organisations, their missions 
and outcomes related to food and climate change action need to be 
clearly mapped and understood.
Awareness about the institutional context within which adaptation 
planning decisions are made is essential for the usability of climate 
change projection (Lorenz 2017) (Chapter 7). In the planning and 
operational process of food production, handling and consumption, the 
475
Food security 
Chapter 5
5
environment benefits and climate change goals can be mainstreamed 
under sustainable management approaches that favour alternative 
solutions for inputs, energy consumption, transformation and diet. 
For instance, land-use planning would guide current and future 
decision-making and planners in exploring uncertainty to increase 
the resilience of communities (Berke and Stevens 2016). One of 
the important policy implications for enhanced food security are 
the trade-offs between agricultural production and environmental 
concerns, including the asserted need for global land-use expansion, 
biodiversity and ecological restoration (Meyfroidt 2017) (Section 5.6).
There are a  number of adaptation options in agriculture in the 
form of policy, planning, governance and institutions (Lorenz 
2017). For example, early spatial planning action is crucial to guide 
decision-making processes and foster resilience in highly uncertain 
future climate change (Brunner and Grêt-Regamey, 2016). Institutions 
may develop new capacities to empower value chain actors, take 
climate change into account as they develop quality products, promote 
adoption of improved diet for healthier lifestyles, aid the improvement 
of livelihoods of communities, and further socioeconomic development 
(Sehmi et al. 2016). Other adaptation policies include property rights 
and land tenure security as legal and institutional reforms to ensure 
transparency and access to land that could stimulate adaptation to 
climate change (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015).
1.3.5.1 
Global initiatives 
Climate change poses serious wide-ranging risks, requiring a broader 
approach in fighting the phenomenon. The United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its annual Conferences 
of the Parties (COPs) has been instrumental in ensuring international 
cooperation in the field of tackling the impacts of climate change 
in a broader framework (Clémençon 2016). The National Adaptation 
Plan (NAP) programme under the UNFCCC was established to: 
identify vulnerable regions; assess the impacts of climate change on 
food security; and prioritise adaptation measures for implementation 
to increase resilience. The National Adaptation Programs of Action 
(NAPAs) was also established to support least-developed countries 
(LDCs) in addressing their particular challenges in adaptation, to 
enhance food security among other priorities. 
The Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) is a major victory for small island 
states and vulnerable nations that face climate change-related impacts 
of floods and droughts resulting in food security challenges. Adaptation 
and mitigation targets set by the parties through their nationally 
determined commitments (NDCs) are reviewed internationally to 
ensure consistency and progress towards actions (Falkner 2016). 
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 
also plays a significant role in designing and coordinating national 
policies to increase adaptation and food security. The five key 
strategic objectives of FAO (help eliminate hunger, food insecurity 
and malnutrition; make agriculture, forestry and fisheries more 
productive and sustainable; reduce rural poverty; enable inclusive and 
efficient agricultural and food systems; and increase the resilience 
of livelihoods to climate threats) (FAO 2018e), all relate to building 
resilience and increasing global adaptation to climate variability. 
In support of the Paris Agreement, FAO launched a  global policy, 
‘Tracking Adaptation’ with the aim of monitoring the adaptation 
processes and outcomes of the parties to increase food security and of 
making available technical information for evaluation by stakeholders. 
In response to the estimated world population of 9.7 billion by 2050, 
FAO adopted the Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) approach to 
increase global food security without compromising environmental 
quality (Section 5.6). FAO supports governments at the national level 
to plan CSA programmes and to seek climate finance to fund their 
adaptation programmes.
The Global Commission on Adaptation, co-managed by World 
Resources Institute (WRI) and the Global Center on Adaptation, seeks 
to accelerate adaptation action by elevating the political visibility of 
adaptation and focusing on concrete solutions (Global Commission 
on Adaptation 2019). The Commission works to demonstrate that 
adaptation is a  cornerstone of better development, and can help 
improve lives, reduce poverty, protect the environment, and enhance 
resilience around the world. The Commission is led by Ban Ki-moon, 
8th Secretary-General of the United Nations, Bill Gates, co-chair 
of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Kristalina Georgieva, 
CEO, World Bank. It is convened by 17 countries and guided by 
28  commissioners. A  global network of research partners and 
advisors provide scientific, economic, and policy analysis. 
1.3.5.2 
National policies
The successful development of food systems under climate change 
conditions requires a  national-level management that involves 
the  cooperation of a  number of institutions and governance 
entities to enable more sustainable and beneficial production and 
consumption practices.
For example, Nepal has developed a novel multi-level institutional 
partnership, under the Local Adaptation Plan of Action (LAPA), 
which is an institutional innovation that aims to better integrate 
local adaptation planning processes and institutions into national 
adaptation processes. That includes collaboration with farmers and 
other non-governmental organisations (Chhetri et al. 2012). By 
combining conventional technological innovation process with the 
tacit knowledge of farmers, this new alliance has been instrumental 
in the innovation of location-specific technologies thereby facilitating 
the adoption of technologies in a more efficient manner.
National Adaptation Planning of Indonesia was officially launched 
in 2014 and was an important basis for ministries and local 
governments to mainstream climate change adaptation into their 
respective sectoral and local development plans (Kawanishi et al. 
2016). Crop land-use policy – to switch from crops that are highly 
impacted by climate change to those that are less vulnerable – were 
suggested for improving climate change adaptation policy processes 
and outcomes in Nepal (Chalise and Naranpanawa 2016). 
Enhancement 
of 
representation, 
democratic 
and 
inclusive 
governance, as well as equity and fairness for improving climate 
change adaptation policy processes and outcomes in Nepal were also 
suggested as institutional measures by Ojha et al. (2015). Further, 
476
Chapter 5 
Food security
5
food, nutrition, and health policy adaptation options such as social 
safety nets and social protection have been implemented in India, 
Pakistan, Middle East and North Africa (Devereux 2015; Mumtaz and 
Whiteford 2017; Narayanan and Gerber 2017). 
Financial incentives policies at the national scale used as adaptation 
options include taxes and subsidies; index-based weather 
insurance schemes; and catastrophe bonds (Zilberman et al. 2018; 
Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler 2015; Ruiter et al. 2017 and 
Campillo et al. 2017). Microfinance, disaster contingency funds, and 
cash transfers are other mechanisms (Ozaki 2016 and Kabir et al. 2016). 
1.3.5.3 
Community-based adaptation 
Community-based adaptation (CBA) builds on social organisational 
capacities and resources to address food security and climate change. 
CBA represents bottom-up approaches and localised adaptation 
measures where social dynamics serve as the power to respond to 
the impacts of climate change (Ayers and Forsyth 2009). It identifies, 
assists, and implements development activities that strengthen 
the capacity of local people to adapt to living in a riskier and less 
predictable climate, while ensuring their food security. 
Klenk et al. (2017) found that mobilisation of local knowledge 
can inform adaptation decision-making and may facilitate greater 
flexibility in government-funded research. As an example, rural 
innovation in terrace agriculture developed on the basis of a local 
coping mechanism and adopted by peasant farmers in Latin America 
may serve as an adaptation option to climate change (Bocco and 
Napoletano, 2017). Clemens et al. (2015) indicated that learning 
alliances provided social learning and knowledge-sharing in Vietnam 
through an open dialogue platform that provided incentives and 
horizontal exchange of ideas.
Community-based 
adaptation 
generates 
strategies 
through 
participatory processes, involving local stakeholders and development 
and disaster risk reduction practitioners. Fostering collaboration 
and community stewardship is central to the success of CBA (Scott 
et al. 2017). Preparedness behaviours that are encouraged include 
social connectedness, education, training, and messaging; CBA also 
can encompass beliefs that might improve household preparedness 
to climate disaster risk (Thomas et al. 2015). Reliance on social 
networks, social groups connectivities, or moral economies reflect 
the importance of collaboration within communities (Reuter 2018; 
Schramski et al. 2017).
Yet, community-based adaptation also needs to consider methods that 
engage with the drivers of vulnerability as part of community-based 
approaches, particularly questions of power, culture, identity and 
practice (Ensor et al. 2018). The goal is to avoid maladaptation or 
exacerbation of existing inequalities within the communities (Buggy 
and McNamara 2016). For example, in the Pacific Islands, elements 
considered in a CBA plan included people’s development aspirations; 
immediate economic, social and environmental benefits; dynamics of 
village governance, social rules and protocols; and traditional forms 
of knowledge that could inform sustainable solutions (Remling and 
Veitayaki 2016). 
With these considerations, community-based adaptation can help 
to link local adaptation with international development and climate 
change policies (Forsyth 2013). In developing CBA programmes, 
barriers exist that may hinder implementation. These include poor 
coordination within and between organisations implementing 
adaptation options, poor skills, poor knowledge about climate 
change, and inadequate communication among stakeholders (Spires 
et al. 2014). A rights-based approach has been suggested to address 
issues of equality, transparency, accountability and empowerment in 
adaptation to climate change (Ensor et al. 2015). 
In summary, institutional measures, including risk management, 
policies, and planning at global, national, and local scales can 
support adaptation. Advance planning and focus on institutions 
can aid in guiding decision-making processes and foster resilience. 
There is evidence that institutional measures can support the scaling 
up of adaptation and thus there is reason to believe that systemic 
resilience is achievable.

Early warning systems
Many countries and regions in the world have adopted early warning 
systems (EWS) to cope with climate variability and change as it helps 
to reduce interruptions and improve response times before and after 
extreme weather events (Ibrahim and Kruczkiewicz 2016). The Early 
Warning and Early Action (EW/EA) framework has been implemented 
in West Africa (Red Cross 2011) and Mozambique (DKNC 2012). 
Bangladesh has constructed cyclone shelters where cyclone warnings 
are disseminated and responses organised (Mallick et al. 2013). 
In Benin, a  Standard Operating Procedure is used to issue early

warnings through the UNDP Climate Information and Early Warning 
Systems Project (UNDP 2016). 
However, there are some barriers to building effective early warning 
systems in Africa, such as lack of reliable data and distribution 
systems, lack of credibility, and limited relationships with media 
and government agencies (UNDP 2016). Mainstreaming early 
warning systems in adaptation planning could present a significant 
opportunity for climate disaster risk reduction (Zia and Wagner 
2015). Enenkel et al. (2015) suggested that the use of smartphone 
applications that concentrate on food and nutrition security could 
help with more frequent and effective monitoring of food prices, 
availability of fertilisers and drought-resistant seeds, and could help 
to turn data streams into useful information for decision support and 
resilience building.
GIS and remote sensing technology are used for monitoring and 
risk quantification for broad-spectrum stresses such as drought, 
heat, cold, salinity, flooding, and pests (Skakun et al. 2017; Senay 
et al. 2015; Hossain et al. 2015 and; Brown 2016), while site-specific 
applications, such as drones, for nutrient management, precision 
fertilisers, and residue management can help devise context-specific 
adaptations (Campbell et al. 2016 and; Baker et al. 2016). Systematic 
monitoring and remote sensing options, as argued by Aghakouchak 
et al. (2015), showed that satellite observations provide opportunities 
to improve early drought warning. Waldner et al. (2015) found that 
cropland mapping allows strategic food and nutrition security 
monitoring and climate modelling. 
Access to a wide range of adaptation technologies for precipitation 
change is important, such as rainwater harvesting, wastewater 
treatment, stormwater management and bioswales, water demand 
reduction, water-use efficiency, water recycling and reuse, aquifer 
recharge, inter-basin water transfer, desalination, and surface-water 
storage (ADB 2014). 
1.3.6.2 
Financial resources
Financial instruments such as micro-insurance, index-based 
insurance, provision of post-disaster finances for recovery and 
pre-disaster payment are fundamental means to reduce lower and 
medium level risks (Linnerooth-Bayer and Hochrainer-Stigler 2014). 
Fenton & Paavola, 2015; Dowla, 2018). Hammill et al. (2010) found 
that microfinance services (MFS) are especially helpful for the poor. 
MFS can provide poor people with the means to diversify, accumulate 
and manage the assets needed to become less susceptible to shocks 
and stresses. As a result, MFS plays an important role in vulnerability 
reduction and climate change adaptation among some of the poor. 
The provision of small-scale financial products to low-income and 
otherwise disadvantaged groups by financial institutions can serve 
as adaptation to climate change. Access to finance in the context 
of climate change adaptation that focuses on poor households and 
women in particular is bringing encouraging results (Agrawala and 
Carraro 2010).
In summary, effective adaptation strategies can reduce the negative 
impacts of climate change. Food security under changing climate 
conditions depends on adaptation throughout the entire food 
system – production, supply chain, and consumption/demand, as well 
as reduction of food loss and waste. Adaptation can be autonomous, 
incremental, or transformative, and can reduce vulnerability and 
enhance resilience. Local food systems are embedded in culture, 
beliefs and values, and ILK can contribute to enhancing food system 
resilience to climate change (high confidence). Institutional and 
capacity-building measures are needed to scale up adaptation 
measures across local, national, regional, and global scales.

1.4.1 
Greenhouse gas emissions from food systems
This chapter assesses the contributions of the entire food system to 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Food systems emissions include 
CO2 and non-CO2 gases, specifically those generated from: (i) crop 
and livestock activities within the farm gate (Table  5.4, category 
‘Agriculture’); (ii) land use and land-use change dynamics associated 
with agriculture (Table  5.4, category ‘Land Use’); and (iii) food 
processing, retail and consumption patterns, including upstream and 
downstream processes such as manufacture of chemical fertilisers 
and fuel (Table  5.4, category ‘Beyond Farm Gate’). The first two 
categories comprise emissions reported by countries in the AFOLU 
(agriculture, forestry, and other land use) sectors of national GHG 
inventories; the latter comprises emissions reported in other sectors 
of the inventory, as appropriate. For instance, industrial processes, 
energy use, and food loss and waste.
The first two components (agriculture and land use) identified above 
are well quantified and supported by an ample body of literature 
(Smith et al. 2014). During the period 2007–2016, global agricultural 
non-CO2 emissions from crop and livestock activities within the farm 
gate were 6.2 ± 1.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 during 2007–2016, with methane 
(142 ± 42 MtCH4 yr–1, or 4.0 ± 1.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 ) contributing in 
CO2-eq about twice as much as nitrous oxide (8.3 ± 2.5 MtN2O yr–1, 
or 2.2 ± 0.7 GtCO2-eq yr–1) to this total (Table 2.2 in Chapter 2). 
Emissions from land use associated with agriculture in some regions, 
such as from deforestation and peatland degradation (both processes 
involved in preparing land for agricultural use), added another 4.9 
± 2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (Chapter 2) globally during the same period. 
These estimates are associated with uncertainties of about 30% 
(agriculture) and 50% (land use), as per IPCC AR5 (Smith et al. 2014). 
Agriculture activities within the farm gate and associated land-use 
dynamics are therefore responsible for about 11.1 ± 2.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1, 
or some 20% of total anthropogenic emissions (Table 5.4), consistent 
with post-AR5 findings (for example, Tubiello et al. 2015). In terms of 
individual gases, the contributions of agriculture to total emissions by 
gas are significantly larger. For instance, over the period 2010–2016, 
methane gas emissions within the farm gate represented about half 
of the total CH4 emitted by all sectors, while nitrous dioxide gas 
emissions within the farm gate represented about three-quarters 
of the total N2O emitted by all sectors (Tubiello 2019). In terms of 
carbon, CO2 emissions from deforestation and peatland degradation 
linked to agriculture contributed about 10% of the CO2 emitted by all 
sectors in 2017 (Le Quéré et al. 2018).
Food systems emissions beyond the farm gate, such as those upstream 
from manufacturing of fertilisers, or downstream such as food 
processing, transport and retail, and food consumption, generally add 
to emissions from agriculture and land use, but their estimation is very 
uncertain due to lack of sufficient studies. The IPCC AR5 (Fischedick 
et al. 2014) provided some information on these other food system 
components, noting that emissions beyond the farm gate in developed 
countries may equal those within the farm gate, and cited one study 
estimating world total food system emissions to be up to 30% of 
total anthropogenic emissions (Garnett 2011). More recently, Poore 
and Nemecek (2018), by looking at a database of farms and using 
a  combination of modelling approaches across relevant processes, 
estimated a total contribution of food systems around 26% of total 
anthropogenic emissions. Total emissions from food systems may 
account for 21–37% of total GHG emissions (medium confidence). 
Based on the available literature, a  break-down of individual 
contributions of food systems emissions is show in Table  5.4, 
between those from agriculture within the farm gate (10–14%) (high 
confidence); emissions from land use and land-use change dynamics 
such as deforestation and peatland degradation, which are associated 
with agriculture in many regions (5–14%) (high confidence); and those 
from food supply chain activities past the farm gate, such as storage, 
processing, transport, and retail (5–10%) (limited evidence, medium

agreement). Note that the corresponding lower range of emissions 
past the farm gate, for example,  2.6  GtCO2-eq yr–1 (Table  5.4), is 
consistent with recent estimates made by Poore and Nemecek (2018). 
Contributions from food loss and waste are implicitly included in these 
estimates of total emissions from food systems (Section 5.5.2.5). They 
may account for 8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions (low 
confidence) (FAO 2013b). 
1.4.2 
Greenhouse gas emissions from croplands 
and soils 
Since AR5, a  few studies have quantified separate contributions of 
crops and soils on the one hand, and livestock on the other, to the 
total emissions from agriculture and associated land use. For instance, 
Carlson et al. (2017) estimated emissions from cropland to be in the 
range of 2–3 GtCO2-eq yr–1, including methane emissions from rice, CO2 
emissions from peatland cultivation, and N2O emissions from fertiliser 
applications. Data from FAOSTAT (2018), recomputed to use AR5 GWP 
values, indicated that cropland emissions from these categories 
were 3.6 ± 1.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 over the period 2010–2016. Two-thirds of 
this were related to peatland degradation, followed by N2O emissions 
from synthetic fertilisers and methane emissions from paddy rice fields 
(Tubiello 2019). These figures are a subset of the total emissions from 
agriculture and land use reported in Table 5.4. Asia, especially India, 
China and Indonesia accounted for roughly 50% of global emissions 
from croplands. Figure 5.9 shows the spatial distribution of emissions 
from cropland according to Carlson  et al.  (2017), not including 
emissions related to deforestation or changes in soil carbon.
1.4.3 
Greenhouse gas emissions from livestock 
Emissions from livestock include non-CO2 gases from enteric 
fermentation from ruminant animals and from anaerobic fermentation 
in manure management processes, as well as non-CO2 gases from 
manure deposited on pastures (Smith et al. 2014). Estimates after the 
AR5 include those from Herrero et al. (2016), who quantified non-CO2 
emissions from livestock to be in the range of 2.0–3.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1, 
with enteric fermentation from ruminants being the main contributor. 
FAOSTAT (2018) estimates of these emissions, renormalized to 
AR5  GWP values, were  4.1 ±  1.2  GtCO2-eq yr–1 over the period 
2010–2016. 
These estimates of livestock emissions are for those generated within 
the farm gate. Adding emissions from relevant land-use change, energy 
use, and transportation processes, FAO (2014a) and Gerber et al. 
(2013) estimated livestock emissions of up to 5.3 ±1.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
circa the year 2010. This data came from original papers, but was 
scaled to SAR global warming potential (GWP) values for methane, 
for comparability with previous results. 
All estimates agree that cattle are the main source of global livestock 
emissions (65–77%). Livestock in low and middle-income countries 
contribute 70% of the emissions from ruminants and 53% from 
monogastric livestock (animals without ruminant digestion processes 
such as pigs and poultry), and these are expected to increase 
as demand for livestock products increases in these countries 
(Figure 5.10). In contrast to the increasing trend in absolute GHG 
emissions, GHG emissions intensities, defined as GHG emissions 
per unit produced, have declined globally and are about 60% lower 
today than in the 1960s. This is largely due to improved meat and 
milk productivity of cattle breeds (FAOSTAT 2018; Davis et al. 2015). 
Still, products like red meat remain the most inefficient in terms of 
emissions per kg of protein produced in comparison to milk, pork, 
eggs and all crop products (IPCC 2014b). Yet, the functional unit used 
in these measurements is highly relevant and may produce different 
results (Salou et al. 2017). For instance, metrics based on products 
tend to rate intensive livestock systems as efficient, while metrics 
based on area or resources used tend to rate extensive systems as 
efficient (Garnett 2011). In ruminant dairy systems, less intensified 
farms show higher emissions if expressed by product, and lower 
emissions if expressed by Utilizable Agricultural Land (Gutiérrez-Peña 
et al. 2019; Salvador et al. 2017; Salou et al. 2017). 
Furthermore, if other variables are used in the analysis of GHG 
emissions of different ruminant production systems, such as 
human-edible grains used to feed animals instead of crop waste 
and pastures of marginal lands, or carbon sequestration in pasture 
systems in degraded lands, then the GHG emissions of extensive 
systems are reduced. Reductions of 26% and 43% have been shown 
in small ruminants, such as sheep and goats (Gutiérrez-Peña et al. 
2019; Salvador et al. 2017; Batalla et al. 2015 and Petersen et al. 
2013). In this regard, depending on what the main challenge is in 
different regions (for example, undernourishment, over-consumption, 
natural resources degradation), different metrics could be used as 
reference. Other metrics that consider nutrient density have been 
proposed because they provide potential for addressing both 
mitigation and health targets (Doran-Browne et al. 2015). 
Uncertainty in worldwide livestock population numbers remains the 
main source of variation in total emissions of the livestock sector, 
while at the animal level, feed intake, diet regime, and nutritional 
composition are the main sources of variation through their impacts 
on enteric fermentation and manure N excretion. 
Increases in economies of scale linked to increased efficiencies 
and decreased emission intensities may lead to more emissions, 
rather than less, an observed dynamic referred to by economists 
as a  ‘rebound effect’. This is because increased efficiency allows 
production processes to be performed using fewer resources and 
often at lower cost. This in turn influences consumer behaviour and 
product use, increasing demand and leading to increased production. 
In this way, the expected gains from new technologies that increase 
the efficiency of resource use may be reduced (for example, increase 
in the total production of livestock despite increased efficiency of 
production due to increased demand for meat sold at lower prices). 
Thus, in order for the livestock sector to provide a contribution to 
GHG mitigation, reduction in emissions intensities need to be 
accompanied by appropriate governance and incentive mechanisms 
to avoid rebound effects, such as limits on total production.

Variation in estimates of N2O emissions are due to differing (i) climate 
regimes, (ii) soil types, and (iii) N transformation pathways (Charles 
et al. 2017 and Fitton et al. 2017). It was recently suggested that 
N2O soil emissions linked to livestock through manure applications 
could be 20–40% lower than previously estimated in some regions. 
For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe (Gerber et al. 
2016) and from smallholder systems in East Africa (Pelster et al. 2017). 
Herrero et al. (2016a) estimated global livestock enteric methane to 
range from 1.6–2.7 Gt CO2-eq, depending on assumptions of body 
weight and animal diet. 
1.4.4 
Greenhouse gas emissions from aquaculture 
Emissions from aquaculture and fisheries may represent some 
10% of total agriculture emissions, or about  0.58  GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(Barange et al. 2018), with two-thirds being non-CO2 emissions from 
aquaculture (Hu et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2015) and the rest due to 
fuel use in fishing vessels. They were not included in Table 5.4 under 
agriculture emissions, as these estimates are not included in national 
GHG inventories and global numbers are small as well as uncertain. 
Methodologies to measure aquaculture emissions are still being 
developed (Vasanth et al. 2016). N2O emissions from aquaculture are 
partly linked to fertiliser use for feed as well as aquatic plant growth, 
and depend on the temperature of water as well as on fish production 
(Paudel et al. 2015). Hu et al. (2012) estimated the global N2O emissions 
from aquaculture in 2009 to be  0.028  GtCO2-eq yr–1, but  could 
increase to  0.114  GtCO2-eq yr–1 (that is  5.72% of anthropogenic 
N2O–N emissions) by 2030 for an estimated 7.10% annual growth 
rate of the aquaculture industry. Numbers estimated by Williams 
and Crutzen (2010) were around 0.036 GtCO2-eq yr–1, and suggested 
that this may rise to more than 0.179 GtCO2-eq yr–1 within 20 years 
for an estimated annual growth of  8.7%. Barange et al.  (2018) 
assessed the contribution of aquaculture to climate change as 
0.38 GtCO2-eq yr–1 in 2010, around 7% of those from agriculture. 
CO2 emissions coming from the processing and transport of feed for 
fish raised in aquaculture, and also the emissions associated with the 
manufacturing of floating cultivation devices (e.g.,  rafts or floating 
fish-farms), connecting or mooring devices, artificial fishing banks or 
reefs, and feeding devices (as well as their energy consumption) may 
be considered within the emissions from the food system. Indeed, 
most of the GHG emissions from aquaculture are associated with the 
production of raw feed materials and secondarily, with the transport of 
raw materials to mills and finished feed to farms (Barange et al. 2018). 
1.4.5 
Greenhouse gas emissions from inputs, 
processing, storage and transport 
Apart from emissions from agricultural activities within the farm gate, 
food systems also generate emissions from the pre- and post-production 
stages in the form of input manufacturing (fertilisers, pesticides, 
feed production) and processing, storage, refrigeration, retail, waste 
disposal, food service, and transport. The total contribution of these 
combined activities outside the farm gate is not well documented. 
Based on information reported in the AR5 (Fischedick et al. 2014) and 
Poore and Nemecek (2018), we estimate their total contribution to 
be roughly 5-10% of total anthropogenic emissions (Table 5.4). There 
is no post-AR5 assessment at the global level in terms of absolute 
emissions. Rather, several studies have recently investigated how the 
combined emissions within and outside the farm gate are embedded 
in food products and thus associated with specific dietary choices (see 
next section). Below important components of food systems emissions 
beyond the farm gate are discussed based on recent literature.
Refrigerated trucks, trailers, shipping containers, warehouses, and 
retail displays that are vital parts of food supply chains all require 
energy and are direct sources of GHG emissions. Upstream emissions 
in terms of feed and fertiliser manufacture and downstream emissions 
(transport, refrigeration) in intensive livestock production (dairy, beef, 
pork) can account for up to 24–32% of total livestock emissions, 
with the higher fractions corresponding to commodities produced 
by monogastric animals (Weiss and Leip 2012). The proportion of 
upstream/downstream emissions fall significantly for less-intensive 
and more-localised production systems (Mottet et al. 2017a).
Transport and processing. Recent globalisation of agriculture 
has promoted industrial agriculture and encouraged value-added 
processing and more distant transport of agricultural commodities, all 
leading to increased GHG emissions. Although often GHG-intensive, 
food transportation plays an important role in food chains: it delivers 
food from producers to consumers at various distances, particularly 
to feed people in food-shortage zones from food-surplus zones. 
(Section 5.5.2.6 for assessment of local food production.)
To some extent, processing is necessary in order to make food supplies 
more stable, safe, long-lived, and in some cases, nutritious (FAO 2007). 
Agricultural production within the farm gate may contribute 80–86% 
of total food-related emissions in many countries, with emissions 
from other processes such as processing and transport being small 
(Vermeulen et al. 2012). However, in net food-importing countries 
where consumption of processed food is common, emissions from 
other parts of the food lifecycle generated in other locations are 
much higher (Green et al. 2015). 
A study conducted by Wakeland et al. (2012) in the USA found that 
the transportation-related carbon footprint varies from a few percent 
to more than half of the total carbon footprint associated with food 
production, distribution, and storage. Most of the GHGs emitted from 
food processing are a  result of the use of electricity, natural gas, 
coal, diesel, gasoline or other energy sources. Cookers, boilers, and 
furnaces emit carbon dioxide, and wastewater emits methane and 
nitrous oxide. The most energy-intensive processing is wet milling 
of maize, which requires 15% of total USA food industry energy 
(Bernstein et al. 2008); processing of sugar and oils also requires 
large amounts of energy.

1.4.6 
Greenhouse gas emissions associated with 
different diets
There is now extensive literature on the relationship between 
food products and emissions, although the focus of the studies 
has been on high-income countries. Godfray et al. (2018) updated 
Nelson et al. (2016), a previous systematic review of the literature 
on environmental impacts associated with food, and concluded 
that higher consumption of animal-based foods was associated 
with higher estimated environmental impacts, whereas increased 
consumption of plant-based foods was associated with estimated 
lower environmental impact. Assessment of individual foods within 
these broader categories showed that meat – sometimes specified 
as ruminant meat (mainly beef) – was consistently identified as the 
single food with the greatest impact on the environment, most often 
in terms of GHG emissions and/or land use per unit commodity. 
Similar hierarchies, linked to well-known energy losses along trophic 
chains, from roots to beef were found in another recent review 
focussing exclusively on GHG emissions (Clune et al. 2017), and 
one on life-cycle assessments (Poore and Nemecek 2018). Poore 
and Nemecek (2018) amassed an extensive database that specifies 
both the hierarchy of emissions intensities and the variance with the 
production context (for example, by country and farming system).
The emissions intensities of red meat mean that its production has 
a disproportionate impact on total emissions (Godfray et al. 2018). 
For example, in the USA 4% of food sold (by weight) is beef, which 
accounts for 36% of food-related emissions (Heller and Keoleian 
2015). Food-related emissions are therefore very sensitive to the 
amount and type of meat consumed. However, 100 g of beef has 
twice as much protein as the equivalent in cooked weight of beans, for 
example, and 2.5 times more iron. One can ingest only about 2.5 kg of 
food per day and not all food items are as dense in nutrition.
There is therefore robust evidence with high agreement that the 
mixture of foods eaten can have a highly significant impact on per 
capita carbon emissions, driven particularly through the amount of 
(especially grain-fed) livestock and products. 
Given the rising costs of malnutrition in all its forms, a legitimate 
question is often asked: would a diet that promotes health through 
good nutrition also be one that mitigates GHG emissions? Whilst 
sustainable diets need not necessarily provide more nutrition, there is 
certainly significant overlap between those that are healthier (e.g., via 
eating more plant-based material and less livestock-based material), 
and eating the appropriate level of calories. In their systematic review, 
Nelson et al. (2016) conclude that, in general, a dietary pattern that is 
higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, 
legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods is more 
health-promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact 
(GHG emissions and energy, land, and water use) than is the current 
average ‘meat-based’ diet.
Recent FAO projections of food and agriculture to 2050 under 
alternative scenarios characterised by different degrees of 
sustainability, provide global-scale evidence that rebalancing diets 
is key to increasing the overall sustainability of food and agricultural 
systems world-wide. A 15% reduction of animal products in the diets 
of high-income countries by 2050 would contribute to containing the 
need to expand agricultural output due to upward global demographic 
trends. Not only would GHG emissions and the pressure on land and 
water be significantly reduced but the potential for low-income 
countries to increase the intake of animal-based food, with beneficial 
nutritional outcomes, could be enhanced (FAO 2018a). Given that 
higher-income countries typically have higher emissions per capita, 
results are particularly applicable in such places. 
However, Springmann et al. (2018a) found that there are locally 
applicable upper bounds to the footprint of diets around the world, 
and for lower-income countries undergoing a  nutrition transition, 
adopting ‘Westernised’ consumption patterns (over-consumption, 
large amounts of livestock produce, sugar and fat), even if in 
culturally applicable local contexts, would increase emissions. The 
global mitigation potential of healthy but low-emissions diets is 
discussed in detail in Section 5.5.2.1.
In summary, food system emissions are growing globally due to 
increasing population, income, and demand for animal-sourced 
products (high confidence). Diets are changing on average toward 
greater consumption of animal-based foods, vegetable oils and 
sugar/sweeteners (high confidence) (see also Chapter  2), with 
GHG emissions increasing due to greater amounts of animal-based 
products in diets (robust evidence, medium agreement). 
1.5 
Mitigation options, challenges 
and opportunities 
The IPCC AR5 WG III concluded that mitigation in agriculture, 
forestry, and land use (AFOLU) is key to limit climate change in the 
21st century, in terms of mitigation of non-CO2 GHGs, which are 
predominately emitted in AFOLU, as well as in terms of land-based 
carbon sequestration. Wollenberg et al. (2016) highlighted the need 
to include agricultural emissions explicitly in national mitigation 
targets and plans, as a necessary strategy to meet the 2°C goal of 
the Paris Agreement. This chapter expands on these key findings to 
document how mitigation in the entire food system, from farm gate 
to consumer, can contribute to reaching the stated global mitigation 
goals, but in a context of improved food security and nutrition. To 
put the range of mitigation potential of food systems in context, it is 
worth noting that emissions from crop and livestock are expected to 
increase by 30–40% from present to 2050, under business-as-usual 
scenarios that include efficiency improvements as well as dietary 
changes linked to increased income per capita (FAO 2018a; Tubiello 
et al. 2014). Using current emissions estimates in this chapter and 
Chapter 2, these increases translate into projected GHG emissions 
from agriculture of 8–9 Gt CO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence).
The AR5 ranked mitigation measures from simple mechanisms such 
as improved crop and livestock management (Smith et al. 2014) 
to more complex carbon dioxide reduction interventions, such as 
afforestation, soil carbon storage and biomass energy projects with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The AR5 WGIII AFOLU chapter 
482
Chapter 5 
Food security
5
(Smith et al. 2014) identified two primary categories of mitigation 
pathways from the food system:
Supply side: Emissions from agricultural soils, land-use change, land 
management, and crop and livestock practices can be reduced and 
terrestrial carbon stocks can be increased by increased production 
efficiencies and carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, while 
emissions from energy use at all stages of the food system can be 
reduced through improvements in energy efficiency and fossil fuel 
substitution with carbon-free sources, including biomass.
Demand side: GHG emissions could be mitigated by changes in diet, 
reduction in food loss and waste, and changes in wood consumption 
for cooking.
In this chapter, supply-side mitigation practices include land-use 
change and carbon sequestration in soils and biomass in both 
crop and livestock systems. Cropping systems practices include 
improved land and fertiliser management, land restoration, biochar 
applications, breeding for larger root systems, and bridging yield 
gaps (Dooley and Stabinsky 2018). Options for mitigation in livestock 
systems include better manure management, improved grazing land 
management, and better feeding practices for animals. Agroforestry 
also is a  supply-side mitigation practice. Improving efficiency in 
supply chains is a supply-side mitigation measure.
Demand-side mitigation practices include dietary changes that lead 
to reduction of GHG emissions from production and changes in land 
use that sequester carbon. Reduction of food loss and waste can 
contribute to mitigation of GHGs on both the supply and demand 
sides. See Section  5.7 and Chapter  7  for the enabling conditions 
needed to ensure that these food system measures would deliver 
their potential mitigation outcomes. 
1.5.1 
Supply-side mitigation options 
The IPCC AR5 identified options for GHG mitigation in agriculture, 
including cropland management, restoration of organic soils, grazing 
land management and livestock, with a total mitigation potential 
of 1.6–4.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2030 (compared to baseline emissions 
in the same year), at carbon prices from 20 to 100 USD per tCO2-eq 
(Smith et al. 2014). Reductions in GHG emissions intensity (emissions 
per unit product) from livestock and animal products can also be 
a  means to achieve reductions in absolute emissions in specific 
contexts and with appropriate governance (medium confidence). 
Agroforestry mitigation practices include rotational woodlots, 
long-term fallow, and integrated land use. 
Emissions from food systems can be reduced significantly by the 
implementation of practices that reduce carbon dioxide, methane, 
and nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural activities related to 
the production of crops, livestock, and aquaculture. These include 
implementation of more sustainable and efficient crop and livestock 
production practices aimed at reducing the amount of land needed 
per output (reductions in GHG emissions intensity from livestock and 
animal production can support reductions in absolute emissions if 
total production is constrained), bridging yield gaps, implementing 
better feeding practices for animals and fish in aquaculture, and 
better manure management (FAO 2019a). Practices that promote soil 
improvements and carbon sequestration can also play an important 
role. In the South America region, reduction of deforestation, 
restoration of degraded pasture areas, and adoption of agroforestry 
and no-till agricultural techniques play a major role in the nation’s 
voluntary commitments to reduce GHG emissions in the country’s 
mitigation activities (Box 5.4).
The importance of supply-side mitigation options is that these 
can be directly applied by food system actors (farmers, processors, 
retailers) and can contribute to improved livelihoods and income 
generation. Recognising and empowering farming system actors 
with the right incentives and governance systems will be crucial to 
increasing the adoption rates of effective mitigation practices and to 
build convincing cases for enabling GHG mitigation (Section 5.7 and 
Chapter 7).
Box 5.4 |  Towards sustainable intensification in South America
Reconciling the increasing global food demand with limited 
land resources and low environmental impact is a  major 
global challenge (FAO 2018a; Godfray and Garnett 2014; Yao 
et al. 2017). South America has been a significant contributor 
of the world’s agricultural production growth in the last three 
decades (OECD and FAO 2015), driven partly by increased 
export opportunities for  specific commodities, mainly 
soybeans and meat (poultry, beef and pork).
Agricultural expansion, however, has driven profound 
landscape transformations in the region, particularly 
between the 1970s and early 2000s, contributing to increased 
deforestation rates and associated GHG emissions. High rates 
of native vegetation  conversion were found in Argentina, 
Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru (FAO 
2016b; Graesser et al. 2015), threatening ecologically 
important biomes, such as the Amazon, the savannas 
(Cerrado, Chacos and Lannos), the Atlantic Rainforest, the 
Caatinga, and the Yungas. The Amazon biome is a particularly 
sensitive biome as it provides crucial ecosystem services 
including biodiversity, hydrological processes (through 
evapotranspiration, cloud formation, and precipitation), and 
biogeochemical cycles (including carbon) (Bogaerts et al. 
2017; Fearnside 2015; Beuchle et al. 2015; Grecchi et al. 2014; 
Celentano et al. 2017; Soares-Filho et al. 2014; Nogueira et al. 
2018). Further, deforestation associated with commodity 
exports has not led to inclusive socioeconomic development, 
but rather has exacerbated social inequality and created 
more challenging living conditions for lower-income people 
(Celentano et al. 2017). Nor has it avoided increased hunger

of local populations in the last few years (FAO 2018b). 
In the mid-2000s, governments, food industries, NGOs, and 
international programmes joined forces to put in place 
important initiatives to respond to the growing concerns 
about the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion 
in the region (Negra et al.  2014; Finer et al. 2018). Brazil 
led regional action by launching the Interministerial Plan of 
Action for Prevention and Control of  Deforestation of the 
Legal Amazon2 (PPCDAm), associated with development 
of a real-time deforestation warning system. Further, Brazil 
built capacity to respond to alerts by coordinated efforts of 
ministries, the federal police, the army and public prosecution 
(Negra et al. 2014; Finer et al. 2018). 
Other countries in the region have also launched similar 
strategies, including a zero-deforestation plan in Paraguay in 
2004 (Gasparri and de Waroux 2015), and no-deforestation 
zones in Argentina in 2007 (Garcia Collazo et al. 2013). 
Peru also developed the National System of Monitoring 
and Control, led by the National Forest Service and Wildlife 
Authority (SERFOR), to provide information and coordinate 
response to deforestation events, and Colombia started 
producing quarterly warning reports on active  fronts of 
deforestation in the country (Finer et al. 2018). 
Engagement of the food industry and NGOs, particularly 
through the Soy Moratorium (from 2006) and Beef 
Moratorium (from 2009) also contributed effectively to keep 
deforestation at low historical rates in the regions where 
they were implemented (Nepstad et al. 2014 and Gibbs 
et al. 2015). In 2012, Brazil also created the national land 
registry system (SICAR), a  georeferenced database, which 
allows monitoring of farms’ environmental liability in order 
to grant access to rural credit. Besides the governmental 
schemes, funding agencies and the Amazon Fund provide 
financial resources to assist smallholder farmers to comply 
with environmental regulations (Jung et al. 2017). 
2 
The Legal Amazon is a Brazilian region of 501.6 Mha (about 59% of the Brazilian territory) that contains all the Amazon but also 40% of the Cerrado and 40% of the 
Pantanal biomes, with a total population of 25.47 million inhabitants.
 
Box 5.4 (continued)
Nevertheless, Azevedo et al. (2017) argue that the full 
potential of these financial incentives has not been achieved, 
due to weak enforcement mechanisms and limited supporting 
public policies. Agricultural expansion and intensification 
have complex interactions with deforestation. While 
mechanisms have been implemented in the region to protect 
native forests and ecosystems, control of deforestation rates 
require stronger governance of natural resources (Ceddia 
et al. 2013 and Oliveira and Hecht 2016), including monitoring 
programmes to evaluate fully the results of land-use policies 
in the region. 
Public and private sector actions resulted in a reduction of the 
Brazilian legal Amazon deforestation rate from 2.78 Mha yr–1 
in 2004, to about 0.75 Mha yr–1 (ca. 0.15%) in 2009 (INPE 
2015), oscillating from 0.46 Mha and 0.79 Mha (2016) since 
then (INPE 2018; Boucher and Chi 2018). The governmental 
forest protection scheme was also expanded to other biomes. 
As a result, the Brazilian Cerrado deforestation was effectively 
reduced from 2.9 Mha yr–1 in 2004 to an average of 0.71 Mha 
yr–1 in 2016–2017 (INPE 2018). 
Overall, deforestation rates in South America have declined 
significantly, with current deforestation rates being about 
half of rates in the early 2000s (FAOSTAT 2018). However, 
inconsistent 
conservation 
policies 
across 
countries 
(Gibbs et al. 2015) and recent hiccups (Curtis et al. 2018) 
indicate that deforestation control still requires stronger 
reinforcement mechanisms (Tollefson 2018). Further, there 
are important spill-over effects that need coordinated 
international governance. Curtis et al. (2018) and Dou et al. 
(2018) point out that, although the Amazon deforestation 
rate decreased in Brazil, it has increased in other regions, 
particularly in South Asia, and in other countries in South 
America, resulting in nearly constant deforestation rates 
worldwide. 
Despite the reduced expansion rates into forest land, 
agricultural production continues to rise steadily in South 
America, relying on increasing productivity and substitution 
of extensive pastureland by crops. The average soybean 
and maize productivity in the region increased from  1.8 
and 2.0 t ha–1 in 1990 to 3.0 and 5.0 t ha–1, respectively, in 
2015 (FAOSTAT 2018). Yet, higher crop productivity was not 
enough to meet growing demand for cereals and oilseeds 
and cultivation continued to expand, mainly on grasslands 
(Richards 2015). The reconciliation of this expansion with 
higher demand for meat and dairy products was carried out 
through the intensification of livestock systems (Martha et al. 
2012). Nevertheless, direct and indirect deforestation still 
occurs, and recently deforestation rates have increased (INPE

2018), albeit they remain far smaller than observed in the 
2000–2010 period.
The effort towards sustainable intensification has also been 
incorporated in agricultural policies. In Brazil, for instance, 
the reduction of deforestation, the restoration of degraded 
pasture areas, the adoption of integrated agroforestry 
systems3 and no-till agricultural techniques play a  major 
role in the nation’s voluntary commitments to reduce GHG 
emissions in the country’s NAMAs (Mozzer 2011) and 
NDCs (Silva Oliveira et al. 2017; Rochedo et al. 2018). Such 
commitment under the UNFCCC is operationalised through 
the Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC),4 which is based on 
low interest credit for investment in sustainable agricultural 
technologies (Mozzer 2011). Direct pasture restoration and 
integrated systems reduce area requirements (Strassburg 
et al. 2014), and increase organic matter (Gil et al. 2015; 
Bungenstab 2012; Maia et al. 2009), contributing to overall 
lifecycle emissions reduction (Cardoso et al. 2016; de Oliveira 
Silva et al. 2016). Also, increased adoption of supplementation 
and feedlots, often based on agroindustrial co-products and 
agricultural crop residues are central to improve productivity 
and increase climate resilience of livestock systems (Mottet 
et al. 2017a; van Zanten et al. 2018). 
Despite providing clear environmental and socio-economic 
co-benefits, including improved resource productivity, 
socio-environmental sustainability and higher economic 
competitiveness, implementation of the Brazilian Low 
Carbon Agriculture Plan is behind schedule (Köberle et al. 
2016). Structural inefficiencies related to the allocation and 
distribution of resources need to be addressed to put the plan 
on track to meet its emissions reduction targets. Monitoring 
and verification are fundamental tools  to guarantee the

successful implementation of the plan. 
Overall, historical data and projections show that South 
America is one of the regions of the world with the highest 
potential to increase crop and livestock production in the 
coming decades in a sustainable manner (Cohn et al. 2014), 
increasing food supply to more densely populated regions 
in Asia, Middle East and Europe. However, a  great and 
coordinated effort is required from governments, industry, 
traders, scientists and the international community to 
improve planning, monitoring and innovation to guarantee 
sustainable intensification of its agricultural systems, 
contribution to GHG mitigation, and conservation of the 
surrounding environment (Negra et  al. 2014; Curtis et al. 
2018 and Lambin et al. 2018). 
1.5.1.1 
Greenhouse gas mitigation in croplands and soils 
The mitigation potential of agricultural soils, cropland and grazing 
land management has been the subject of much research and was 
thoroughly summarised in the AR5 (Smith et al. 2014) (see also 
Chapter 2, Section 2.5.1 and Chapter 6, Section 6.3.1). Key mitigation 
pathways are related to practices reducing nitrous oxide emissions 
from fertiliser applications, reducing methane emissions from paddy 
rice, reducing both gases through livestock manure management 
and applications, and sequestering carbon or reducing its losses, 
with practices for improving grassland and cropland management 
identified as the largest mitigation opportunities. Better monitoring 
reporting and verification (MRV) systems are currently needed for 
reducing uncertainties and better quantifying the actual mitigation 
outcomes of these activities.

New work since AR5 has focused on identifying pathways for the 
reductions of GHG emissions from agriculture to help meet Paris 
Agreement goals (Paustian et al. 2016 and Wollenberg et al. 2016). 
Altieri and Nicholls (2017) have characterised mitigation potentials 
from traditional agriculture. Zomer et al. (2017) have updated previous 
estimates of global carbon sequestration potential in cropland soils. 
Mayer et al. (2018) converted soil carbon sequestration potential 
through agricultural land management into avoided temperature 
reductions. Fujisaki et al. (2018) identify drivers to increase soil 
organic carbon in tropical soils. For discussion of integrated practices 
such as sustainable intensification, conservation agriculture and 
agroecology, see Section 5.6.4.
Paustian et al. (2016) developed a  decision-tree for facilitating 
implementation of mitigation practices on cropland and described 
the features of key practices. They observed that most individual 
mitigation practices will have a small effect per unit of land, and 
hence they need to be combined and applied at large scales for their 
impact to be significant. Examples included aggregation of cropland 
practices (for example, organic amendments, improved crop rotations 
and nutrient management and reduced tillage) and grazing land 
practices (e.g., grazing management, nutrient and fire management 
and species introduction) that could increase net soil carbon stocks 
while reducing emissions of N2O and CH4. 
However, it is well-known that the portion of projected mitigation 
from soil carbon stock increase (about 90% of the total technical 
potential) is impermanent. It would be effective for only 20–30 years 
due to saturation of the soil capacity to sequester carbon, whereas 
non-CO2 emission reductions could continue indefinitely. ‘Technical 
potential’ is the maximum amount of GHG mitigation achievable 
through technology diffusion.
Biochar application and management towards enhanced root 
systems are mitigation options that have been highlighted in recent 
literature (Dooley and Stabinsky 2018; Hawken 2017; Paustian et al. 
2016; Woolf et al. 2010 and Lenton 2010). 
1.5.1.2 
Greenhouse gas mitigation in livestock systems
The technical options for mitigating GHG emissions in the livestock 
sector have been the subject of recent reviews (Mottet et al. 
2017b; Hristov et al. 2013a,b; Smithers 2015; Herrero et al. 2016a; 
Rivera-Ferre et al. 2016b) (Figure  5.11). They can be classified 
as either targeting reductions in enteric methane; reductions 
in nitrous oxide through manure management; sequestering 
carbon in pastures; implementation of best animal husbandry and 
management practices, which would have an effect on most GHG; 
and land-use practices that also help sequester carbon. Excluding 
land-use practices, these options have a  technical mitigation 
potential ranging 0.2–2.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (Herrero et al. 2016a; FAO 
2007) (Chapters 2 and 6.) 
The opportunities for carbon sequestration in grasslands and 
rangelands may be significant (Conant 2010), for instance, 
through changes in grazing intensity or manure recycling aimed 
at maintaining grassland productivity (Hirata et al. 2013). Recent 
studies have questioned the economic potential of such practices in 
regard to whether they could be implement at scale for economic 
gain (Garnett et al. 2017; Herrero et al. 2016a and Henderson 
et al. 2015). For instance, Henderson et al. (2015) found economic 
potentials below 200 MtCO2-eq yr–1. Carbon sequestration can occur 
in situations where grasslands are highly degraded (Garnett 2016). 
Carbon sequestration linked to livestock management could thus be 
considered as a co-benefit of well-managed grasslands, as well as 
a mitigation practice.
Different production systems will require different strategies, 
including the assessment of impacts on food security, and this 
has been the subject of significant research (e.g.,  Rivera-Ferre 
et al. 2016b). Livestock systems are heterogeneous in terms of 
their agroecological orientation (arid, humid or temperate/highland 
locations), livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry and 
others), structure (grazing only, mixed-crop-livestock systems, 
industrial systems, feedlots and others), level of intensification, and 
resource endowment (Robinson 2011). 
The implementation of strategies presented in Figure 5.11 builds on 
this differentiation, providing more depth compared to the previous 
AR5 analysis. Manure management strategies are more applicable 
in confined systems, where manure can be easily collected, such as 
in pigs and poultry systems or in smallholder mixed crop-livestock 
systems. More intensive systems, with strong market orientation, such 
as dairy in the US, can implement a range of sophisticated practices 
like feed additives and vaccines, while many market-oriented dairy 
systems in tropical regions can improve feed digestibility by improving 
forage quality and adding larger quantities of concentrate to the 
rations. Many of these strategies can be implemented as packages in 
different systems, thus maximising the synergies between different 
options (Mottet et al. 2017b).
See the Supplementary Material Section SM5.3 for a  detailed 
description of livestock mitigation strategies; synergies and trade-offs 
with other mitigation and adaptation options are discussed in 
Section 5.6.

1.5.1.3 
Greenhouse gas mitigation in agroforestry
Agroforestry can curb GHG emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O in 
agricultural systems in both developed and developing countries 
(see Glossary for definition) (see Chapter  2, Section  2.5.1 and 
Figure  2.24). Soil carbon sequestration, together with biological 
N fixation, improved land health and underlying ecosystem services 
may be enhanced through agricultural lands management practices 
used by large-scale and smallholder farmers, such as incorporation 
of trees within farms or in hedges (manure addition, green manures, 
cover crops, etc.), whilst promoting greater soil organic matter and 
nutrients (and thus soil organic carbon) content and improve soil 
structure (Mbow et al. 2014b) (Table 5.5). The tree cover increases 
the microbial activity of the soil and increases the productivity of the 
grass under cover. CO2 emissions are furthermore lessened indirectly, 
through lower rates of erosion due to better soil structure and more 
plant cover in diversified farming systems than in monocultures. There 
is great potential for increasing above-ground and soil carbon stocks, 
reducing soil erosion and degradation, and mitigating GHG emissions. 
These practices can improve food security through increases in 
productivity and stability since they contribute to increased soil 
quality and water-holding capacity. Agroforestry provides economic, 
ecological, and social stability through diversification of species and 
products. On the other hand, trade-offs are possible when cropland is 
taken out of production mainly as a mitigation strategy. 
Meta-analyses have been done on carbon budgets in agroforestry 
systems (Zomer et al. 2016; Chatterjee et al. 2018). In a  review 
of 42  studies, (Ramachandran Nair et al. 2009) estimated 
carbon  sequestration potentials of differing agroforestry systems. 
These include sequestration rates ranging from 954 (semi-arid); 
to 1431 (temperate); 2238 (sub-humid) and 3670  tCO2 km–2 yr–1 
(humid). 
The 
global 
technical 
potential 
for 
agroforestry 
is 0.1–5.7 Gt CO2e yr–1 (Griscom et al. 2017; Zomer et al. 2016; Dickie 
et al. 2014) (Chapter  2, Section  2.5.1). Agroforestry-based carbon 
sequestration can be used to offset N2O and CO2 emissions from soils 
and increase methane sink strength compared to annual cropping 
systems (Rosenstock et al. 2014). 
Agroforestry systems with perennial crops, such as coffee and cacao, 
may be more important carbon sinks than those that combine trees 
with annual crops. Brandt et al. (2018) showed that farms in semi-arid 
regions (300–600 mm precipitation) were increasing in tree cover 
due to natural regeneration and that the increased application of 
agroforestry systems were supporting production and reducing 
GHG emissions.
1.5.1.4 
Integrated approaches to crop 
and livestock mitigation 
Livestock mitigation in a circular economy. Novel technologies 
for increasing the integration of components in the food system are 
being devised to reduce GHG emissions. These include strategies that 
help decoupling livestock from land use. Work by van Zanten et al. 
(2018) shows that 7–23 g of animal protein per capita per day could 
be produced without livestock competing for vital arable land. This 
would imply a contraction of the land area utilised by the livestock 
sector, but also a more efficient use of resources, and would lead to 
land sparing and overall emissions reductions.
Pikaar et al. (2018) demonstrated the technical feasibility of producing 
microbial protein as a feedstuff from sewage that could replace use 
of feed crops such as soybean. The technical potential of this novel 
practice could replace 10–19% of the feed protein required, and 
would reduce cropland demand and associated emissions by 6–7%. 
These practices are, however, not economically feasible nor easily 
upscalable in most systems. Nonetheless, significant progress in 
Japan and South Korea in the reduction and use of food waste to 
increase efficiencies in livestock food chains has been achieved, 
indicating a  possible pathway to progress elsewhere (FAO 2017; 
zu Ermgassen et al. 2016). Better understanding of biomass and food 
and feed wastes, value chains, and identification of mechanisms for 
reducing the transport and processing costs of these materials is 
required to facilitate larger-scale implementation.
Waste streams into energy. Waste streams from manure and food 
waste can be used for energy generation and thus reduction in overall 
GHG emissions in terms of recovered methane (for instance through 
anaerobic digestion) production (De Clercq et al. 2016) or for the 
production of microbial protein (Pikaar et al. 2018). Second-generation 
biorefineries, once the underlying technology is improved, may 
enable the generation of hydro-carbon from agricultural residues, 
grass, and woody biomass in ways that do not compete with food 
and can generate, along with biofuel, high-value products such as 
plastics (Nguyen et al. 2017). Second-generation energy biomass from 
residues may constitute a complementary income source for farmers 
that can increase their incentive to produce. Technologies include CHP 
(combined heat and power) or gas turbines, and fuel types such as 
biodiesel, biopyrolysis (i.e., high temperature chemical transformation 
of organic material in the absence of oxygen), torrefaction of biomass, 
production of cellulosic bioethanol and of bioalcohols produced by 
other means than fermentation, and the production of methane by 
anaerobic fermentation. (Nguyen et al. 2017).
Technology for reducing fossil fuel inputs. Besides biomass and 
bioenergy, other forms of renewable energy substitution for fossil fuels 
(e.g., wind, solar, geothermal, hydro) are already being applied on farms 
throughout the supply chain. Energy efficiency measures are being 
developed for refrigeration, conservation tillage, precision farming 
(e.g., fertiliser and chemical application and precision irrigation).
Novel technologies. Measures that can reduce livestock emissions 
given continued research and development include methane and 
nitrification inhibitors, methane vaccines, targeted breeding of 
lower-emitting animals, and genetically modified grasses with 
higher sugar content. New strategies to reduce methanogenesis 
include supplementing animal diets with antimethanogenic agents 
(e.g.,  3-NOP, algae, chemical inhibitors such as chloroform) or 
supplementing with electron acceptors (e.g.,  nitrate) or dietary 
lipids. These could potentially contribute, once economically feasible 
at scale, to significant reductions of methane emissions from 
ruminant livestock. A  well-tested compound is  3-nitrooxypropanol 
488

(3-NOP), which was shown to decrease methane by up to 40% when 
incorporated in diets for ruminants (Hristov et al. 2015). 
Whilst these strategies may become very effective at reducing methane, 
they can be expensive and also impact on animal performance and/or 
welfare (Llonch et al. 2017). The use of novel fertilisers and/or plant 
species that secrete biological nitrification inhibitors also have the 
potential to significantly reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils 
(Subbarao et al. 2009; Rose et al. 2018). 
Economic mitigation potentials of crop and livestock sectors. 
Despite the large technical mitigation potential of the agriculture 
sector in terms of crop and livestock activities, its economic potential 
is relatively small in the short term (2030) and at modest carbon prices 
(less than 20 USD tC–1). For crop and soil management practices, it is 
estimated that 1.0–1.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 could be a feasible mitigation 
target at a carbon price of 20 USD tC–1 (Frank et al. 2018, 2017; 
Griscom et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2013; Wollenberg et al. 2016). For the 
livestock sector, these estimates range from 0.12–0.25 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
at similar carbon prices (Herrero et al. 2016c; Henderson et al. 2017). 
But care is needed in comparing crop and livestock economic 
mitigation potentials due to differing assumptions.
Frank et al. (2018) recently estimated that the economic mitigation 
potential of non-CO2 emissions from agriculture and livestock to 
2030 could be up to four times higher than indicated in the AR5, if 
structural options such as switching livestock species from ruminants 
to monogastrics, or allowing for flexibility to relocate production to 
more efficient regions were implemented, at the same time as the 
technical options such as those described above. At higher carbon 
prices (i.e., at about 100 USD tC–1), they found a mitigation potential 
of supply-side measures of 2.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1.

Figure 5.12 |  Technical mitigation potential of changing diets by 2050 according to a range of scenarios examined in the literature. Estimates indicate 
technical potential only and include additional effects of carbon sequestration from land-sparing. Data without error bars are from one study only. 
All diets need to provide a full complement of nutritional quality, including micronutrients (FAO et al. 2018).
Vegan: Completely plant-based (Springmann et al. 2016b; Stehfest et al. 2009).
Vegetarian: Grains, vegetables, fruits, sugars, oils, eggs and dairy, and generally at most one serving per month of meat or seafood (Springmann et al. 2016b; Tilman and Clark 
2014; Stehfest et al. 2009).
Flexitarian: 75% of meat and dairy replaced by cereals and pulses; at least 500 g per day fruits and vegetables; at least 100 g per day of plant-based protein sources; modest 
amounts of animal-based proteins and limited amounts of red meat (one portion per week), refined sugar (less than 5% of total energy), vegetable oils high in saturated fat, 
and starchy foods with relatively high glycaemic index (Springmann et al. 2018a; Hedenus et al. 2014).
Healthy diet: Based on global dietary guidelines for consumption of red meat, sugar, fruits and vegetables, and total energy intake (Springmann et al. 2018a; Bajželj et al. 2014).
Fair and frugal: Global daily per-capita calorie intake of 2800 kcal/cap/day (11.7 MJ/cap/day), paired with relatively low level of animal products (Smith et al. 2013).
Pescetarian: Vegetarian diet that includes seafood (Tilman and Clark 2014).
Climate carnivore: 75% of ruminant meat and dairy replaced by other meat (Hedenus et al. 2014).
Mediterranean: Vegetables, fruits, grains, sugars, oils, eggs, dairy, seafood, moderate amounts of poultry, pork, lamb and beef (Tilman and Clark 2014).

In this scenario, technical options would account for 38% of the 
abatement, while another 38% would be obtained through structural 
changes, and a  further 24% would be obtained through shifts in 
consumption caused by food price increases. Key to the achievement 
of this mitigation potential lay in the livestock sector, as reductions 
in livestock consumption, structural changes and implementation 
of technologies in the sector had some of the highest impacts. 
Regions with the highest mitigation potentials were Latin America, 
China and Sub-Saharan Africa. The large-scale implementability of 
such proposed sweeping changes in livestock types and production 
systems is likely very limited as well as constrained by long-established 
socio-economic, traditional and cultural habits, requiring significant 
incentives to generate change.
In summary, supply-side practices can contribute to climate change 
mitigation by reducing crop and livestock emissions, sequestering 
carbon in soils and biomass, and by decreasing emissions intensity 
within sustainable production systems (high confidence). The AR5 
estimated the total economic mitigation potential of crop and 
livestock activities as  1.5–4.0  GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2030 at prices 
ranging from 20–100 USD tCO2-eq (high confidence). Options with 
large potential for GHG mitigation in cropping systems include soil 
carbon sequestration (at decreasing rates over time), reductions 
in N2O emissions from fertilisers, reductions in CH4 emissions 
from paddy rice, and bridging of yield gaps. Options with large 
potential for mitigation in livestock systems include better grazing 
land management, with increased net primary production and soil 
carbon stocks, improved manure management, and higher-quality 
feed. Reductions in GHG emissions intensity (emissions per unit 
product) from livestock can support reductions in absolute emissions, 
provided appropriate governance structures to limit total production 
are implemented at the same time (medium confidence).
1.5.1.5 
Greenhouse gas mitigation in aquaculture
Barange et al. (2018) provide a synthesis of effective options for GHG 
emissions reduction in aquaculture, including reduction of emissions 
from production of feed material, replacement of fish-based feed 
ingredients with crop-based ingredients; reduction of emissions 
from feed mill energy use, improvement of feed conversion rates, 
improvement of input use efficiency, shift of energy supply (from 
high-carbon fossil fuels to low-carbon fossil fuels or renewables), and 
improvement of fish health. Conversion of 25% of total aquaculture 
area to integrated aquaculture-agriculture ponds (greening 
aquaculture) has the potential to sequester 95.4 million tonnes of 
carbon per year (Ahmed et al. 2017). 
Proposed mitigation in aquaculture includes avoided deforestation. 
By halting annual mangrove deforestation in Indonesia, associated 
total emissions would be reduced by 10–31% of estimated 
annual emissions from the land-use sector at present (Murdiyarso 
et al. 2015). Globally, 25% mangrove regeneration could 
sequester 0.54–0.65 million tonnes of carbon per year (Ahmed et al. 
2017) of which 0.17–0.21 million tonnes could be through integrated 
or organic shrimp culture (Ahmed et al. 2018).
1.5.1.6 
Cellular agriculture
The technology for growing muscle tissue in culture from animal 
stem cells to produce meat, for example, ‘cultured’, ‘synthetic’, ‘in 
vitro’ or ‘hydroponic’ meat could, in theory, be constructed with 
different characteristics and be produced faster and more efficiently 
than traditional meat (Kadim et al. 2015). Cultured meat (CM) is 
part of so-called cellular agriculture, which includes production of 
milk, egg white and leather from industrial cell cultivation (Stephens 
et al. 2018). CM is produced from muscle cells extracted from living 
animals, isolation of adult skeletal muscle stem cells (myosatellite 
cells), placement in a culture medium which allow their differentiation 
into myoblasts and then, through another medium, generation of 
myocytes which coalesce into myotubes and grow into strands in 
a stirred-tank bioreactor (Mattick et al. 2015). 
Current technology enables the creation of beef hamburgers, 
nuggets, steak chips or similar products from meat of other animals, 
including wild species, although production currently is far from being 
economically feasible. Nonetheless, by allowing bioengineering from 
the manipulation of the stem cells and nutritive culture, CM allows 
for reduction of harmful fatty acids, with advantages such as reduced 
GHG emissions, mostly indirectly through reduced land use (Bhat 
et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2017b). 
Tuomisto and de Mattos (2011) made optimistic technological 
assumptions, relying on cyanobacteria hydrolysate nutrient source, 
and produced the lowest estimates on energy and land use. Tuomisto 
and de Mattos (2011) conducted a lifecycle assessment that indicates 
that cultured meat could have less than 60% of energy use and 1% of 
land use of beef production and it would have lower GHG emissions 
than pork and poultry as well. Newer estimates (Alexander et al. 2017; 
Mattick et al. 2015) indicate a trade-off between industrial energy 
consumption and agricultural land requirements of conventional and 
cultured meat and possibly higher GWP than pork or poultry due 
to higher energy use. The change in proportion of CO2 versus CH4 
could have important implications in climate change projections and, 
depending on decarbonisation of the energy sources and climate 
change targets, cultured meat may be even more detrimental than 
exclusive beef production (Lynch and Pierrehumbert 2019).
Overall, as argued by Stephens et al. (2018), cultured meat is an 
‘as-yet undefined ontological object’ and, although marketing 
targets people who appreciate meat but are concerned with animal 
welfare and environmental impacts, its market is largely unknown 
(Bhat et al. 2015 and Slade 2018). In this context it will face the 
competition of imitation meat (meat analogues from vegetal protein) 
and insect-derived products, which have been evaluated as more 
environmentally friendly (Alexander et al. 2017) and it may be 
considered as being an option for a limited resource world, rather 
than a mainstream solution. Besides, as the commercial production 
process is still largely undefined, its actual contribution to climate 
change mitigation and food security is largely uncertain and 
challenges are not negligible. Finally, it is important to understand 
the systemic nature of these challenges and evaluate their social 
impacts on rural populations due to transforming animal agriculture 
into an industrialised activity and its possible rebound effects on food 
security, which are still understudied in the literature.

Studies are needed to improve quantification of mitigation options 
for supply chain activities. 
1.5.2 
Demand-side mitigation options 
Although population growth is one of the drivers of global food 
demand and the resulting environmental burden, demand-side 
management of the food system could be one of the solutions to 
curb climate change. Avoiding food waste during consumption, 
reducing over-consumption, and changing dietary preferences can 
contribute significantly to providing healthy diets for all, as well as 
reducing the environmental footprint of the food system. The number 
of studies addressing this issue have increased in the last few years 
(Chapter 2). (See Section 5.6 for synergies and trade-offs with health 
and Section 5.7 for discussion of Just Transitions.)
1.5.2.1 
Mitigation potential of different diets 
A systematic review found that higher consumption of animal-based 
foods was associated with higher estimated environmental impact, 
whereas increased consumption of plant-based foods was associated 
with an estimated lower environmental impact (Nelson et al. 2016). 
Assessment of individual foods within these broader categories showed 
that meat – especially ruminant meat (beef and lamb) – was consistently 
identified as the single food with the greatest impact on the environment, 
on a global basis, most often in terms of GHG emissions and/or land use.
Figure  5.12 shows the technical mitigation potentials of some 
scenarios of alternative diets examined in the literature. Stehfest et al. 
(2009) were among the first to examine these questions. They found 
that under the most extreme scenario, where no animal products 
are consumed at all, adequate food production in 2050 could be 
achieved on less land than is currently used, allowing considerable 
forest regeneration, and reducing land-based GHG emissions to one 
third of the reference ‘business-as-usual’ case for 2050, a reduction 
of 7.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1. Springmann et al. (2016b) recently estimated 
similar emissions reduction potential of 8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 from a vegan 
diet without animal-sourced foods. This defines the upper bound of 
the technical mitigation potential of demand side measures. 
Herrero et al. (2016a) reviewed available options, with a  specific 
focus on livestock products, assessing technical mitigation potential 
across a  range of scenarios, including ‘no animal products’, 
‘no  meat’, ‘no ruminant meat’, and ‘healthy diet’ (reduced meat 
consumption). With regard to ‘credible low-meat diets’, where 
reduction in animal protein intake was compensated by higher 
intake of pulses, emissions reductions by 2050 could be in 
the 4.3–6.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1, compared to a business-as-usual scenario. 
Of this technical potential, 1–2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 come from reductions 
of mostly non-CO2 GHG within the farm gate, while the remainder 
was linked to carbon sequestration on agricultural lands no longer 
needed for livestock production. When the transition to a low-meat 
diet reduces the agricultural area required, land is abandoned, and 
the re-growing vegetation can take up carbon until a new equilibrium 
is reached. This is known as the land-sparing effect. 
Other studies have found similar results for potential mitigation 
linked to diets. For instance, Smith et al. (2013) analysed a dietary 
change scenario that assumed a  convergence towards a  global 
daily per-capita calorie intake of 2800  kcal per person per day 
(11.7 MJ per person per day), paired with a relatively low level of 
animal product supply, estimated technical mitigation potential in the 
range 0.7–7.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1 for additional variants including low or 
high-yielding bioenergy, 4.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1 if spare land is afforested. 
Bajželj et al. (2014) developed different scenarios of farm systems 
change, waste management, and dietary change on GHG emissions 
coupled to land use. Their dietary scenarios were based on target 
kilocalorie consumption levels and reductions in animal product 
consumption. Their scenarios were ‘healthy diet’; healthy diet with 
2500 kcal per person per day in 2050; corresponding to technical 
mitigation potentials in the range 5.8 and 6.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1.
Hedenus et al. (2014) explored further dietary variants based on 
the type of livestock product. ‘climate carnivore’, in which 75% of 
the baseline-consumption of ruminant meat and dairy was replaced 
by pork and poultry meat, and ‘flexitarian’, in which 75% of the 
baseline-consumption of meat and dairy was replaced by pulses and 
cereal products. Their estimates of technical mitigation potentials by 
2050 ranged 3.4–5.2 GtCO2-eq yr–1, the high end achieved under 
the flexitarian diet. Finally, Tilman and Clark (2014) used stylised 
diets as variants that included ‘peseatarian’, ‘Mediterranean’, 
‘vegetarian’, compared to a reference diet, and estimated technical 
mitigation potentials within the farm gate of 1.2–2.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1, 
with additional mitigation from carbon sequestration on spared land 
ranging 1.8–2.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1. 
Studies have defined dietary mitigation potential as, for example, 
20 kg per person per week CO2-eq for Mediterranean diet, versus 
13 kg per person per week CO2-eq for vegan (Castañé and Antón 
2017). Rosi et al. (2017) developed seven-day diets in Italy for about 
150 people defined as omnivore 4.0 ± 1.0; ovo-lacto-veggie 2.6 ± 0.6; 
and vegan 2.3 ± 0.5 kg CO2-eq per capita per day. 
Importantly, many more studies that compute the economic and 
calorie costs of these scenarios are needed. Herrero et al. (2016a) 
estimated that once considerations of economic and calorie costs 
of their diet-based solutions were included, the technical range of  
4.3–6.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 in 2050 was reduced to 1.8–3.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
when implementing a  GHG tax ranging from 20–100  USD tCO2. 
While caloric costs where low below 20 USD tCO2, they ranged from 
27–190 kcal per person per day under the higher economic potential, 
thus indicating possible negative trade-offs with food security.
In summary, demand-side changes in food choices and consumption 
can help to achieve global GHG mitigation targets (high confidence). 
Low-carbon diets on average tend to be healthier and have smaller 
land footprints. By 2050, technical mitigation potential of dietary 
changes range from 2.7–6.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 for assessed diets (high 
confidence). At the same time, the economic potential of such 
solutions is lower, ranging from 1.8–3.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 at prices of 
20–100 USD tCO2, with caloric costs up to 190 kcal per person per 
day. The feasibility of how to create economically viable transitions 
491

to more sustainable and healthy diets that also respect food security 
requirements needs to be addressed in future research.
1.5.2.2 
 Role of dietary preferences 
Food preference is an inherently cultural dimension that can ease or 
hinder transformations to food systems that contribute to climate 
change mitigation. Consumer choice and dietary preferences are 
guided by social, cultural, environmental, and traditional factors 
as well as economic growth. The food consumed by a given group 
conveys cultural significance about social hierarchy, social systems 
and human-environment relationships (Herforth and Ahmed 2015). 
As suggested by Springmann et al. (2018a), per capita dietary 
emissions will translate into different realised diets, according to 
regional contexts including cultural and gendered norms (e.g., among 
some groups, eating meat is perceived as more masculine (Ruby 
and Heine 2011). In some cases, women and men have different 
preferences in terms of food, with women reporting eating healthier 
food (Imamura et al. 2015; Kiefer et al. 2005; Fagerli and Wandel 
1999): these studies found that men tend to eat more meat, while 
women eat more vegetables, fruits and dairy products (Kanter and 
Caballero 2012). 
Food preferences can change over time, with the nutrition transition 
from traditional diets to high-meat, high-sugar, high-saturated fat 
diets being a clear example of significant changes occurring in a short 
period of time. Meat consumption per capita consistently responds 
to income with a saturating trend at high income levels (Sans and 
Combris 2015; Vranken et al. 2014). Some emerging economies have 
rapidly increased demand for beef, leading to pressure on natural 
resources (Bowles et al. 2019). In another example, by reducing 
beef consumption between 2005 and 2014, Americans avoided 
approximately 271  million metric tonnes of emissions (CO2-eq) 
(NRDC 2017). Attending farmers markets or buying directly from 
local producers has been shown to change worldviews (Kerton and 
Sinclair 2010), and food habits towards healthier diets (Pascucci et al. 
2011) can be advanced through active learning (Milestad et al. 2010). 
Regarding the options to reduce meat intake in developed countries, 
research shows that there is an apparent sympathy of consumers 
for meat reduction due to environmental impacts (Dagevos and 
Voordouw 2013), which has not been exploited. Social factors 
that influence reducing meat consumption in New Zealand include 
the need for better education or information dispersal regarding 
perceived barriers to producing meat-reduced/less meals; ensuring 
there is sensory or aesthetic appeal; and placing emphasis on human 
health or nutritional benefits (Tucker 2018). 
Different and complementary strategies can be used in parallel for 
different consumer’s profiles to facilitate step-by-step changes in the 
amounts and the sources of protein consumed. In the Netherlands, 
a nationwide sample of 1083 consumers were used to study their 
dietary choices toward smaller portions of meat, smaller portions 
using meat raised in a more sustainable manner, smaller portions and 
eating more vegetable protein, and meatless meals with or without 
meat substitutes. Results showed that strategies to change meat 
eating frequencies and meat portion sizes appeared to overlap and 
that these strategies can be applied to address consumers in terms of 
their own preferences (de Boer et al. 2014).
1.5.2.3 
Uncertainties in demand-side mitigation potential
Both reducing ruminant meat consumption and increasing its efficiency 
are often identified as the main options to reduce GHG emissions 
(GHGE) and to lessen pressure on land (Westhoek  et al.  2014)  
(see Section  5.6 for synergies and trade-offs with health and 
Section  5.7 for discussion of Just Transitions). However, analysing 
ruminant meat production is highly complex because of the extreme 
heterogeneity of production systems and due to the numerous 
products and services associated with ruminants (Gerber et al. 2015). 
See Supplementary Material Section SM5.3 for further discussion of 
uncertainties in estimates of livestock mitigation technical potential. 
Further, current market mechanisms are regarded as insufficient 
to decrease consumption or increase efficiency, and governmental 
intervention is often suggested to encourage mitigation in both 
the supply-side and demand-side of the food system (Section 5.7) 
(Wirsenius et al. 2011; Henderson et al. 2018).
Minimising GHG emissions through mathematical programming 
with near-minimal acceptability constraints can be understood as 
a reference or technical potential for mitigation through diet shifts. 
In this context (Macdiarmid et al. 2012) found up to 36% reduction in 
emissions in UK with similar diet costs applying fixed lifecycle analyses 
(LCA) carbon footprints (i.e., no rebound effects considered). Westhoek 
et al. (2014) found 25–40% in emissions by halving meat, dairy and 
egg intake in the EU, applying standard IPCC fixed emission intensity 
factors. Uncertainty about the consequences of on-the-ground 
implementation of policies towards low ruminant meat consumption 
in the food system and their externalities remain noteworthy. 
Often, all emissions are allocated only to human edible meat and 
the boundaries are set only within the farm gate (Henderson et al. 
2018; Gerber et al. 2013). However, less than 50% of slaughtered 
cattle weight is human edible meat, and 1–10% of the mass is lost 
or incinerated, depending on specified risk materials legislation. The 
remaining mass provide inputs to multiple industries, for example 
clothing, furniture, vehicle coating materials, biofuel, gelatine, soap, 
cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceutical industrial supplies, pet feed 
ingredients and fertilisers (Marti et al. 2011; Mogensen et al. 2016; 
Sousa et al. 2017). This makes ruminant meat production one of 
the most complex problems for LCA in the food system (Place and 
Mitloehner 2012; de Boer et al. 2011). There are only a few examples 
taking into account slaughter by-products (Mogensen et al. 2016). 
1.5.2.4 
Insect-based diets
Edible insects are, in general, rich in protein, fat, and energy and 
can be a  significant source of vitamins and minerals (Rumpold 
and Schlüter 2015). Approximately 1900 insect species are eaten 
worldwide, mainly in developing countries (van Huis 2013). The 
development of safe rearing and effective processing methods are 
mandatory for utilisation of insects in food and feed. Some insect 
species can be grown on organic side streams, reducing environmental 
492

contamination and transforming waste into high-protein feed. Insects 
are principally considered as meat substitutes, but worldwide meat 
substitute consumption is still very low, principally due to differences 
in food culture, and will require transition phases such as powdered 
forms (Megido et al. 2016 and Smetana et al. 2015). Wider consumer 
acceptability will relate to pricing, perceived environmental benefits, 
and the development of tasty insect-derived protein products (van 
Huis et al. 2015; van Huis 2013). Clearly, increasing the share of 
insect-derived protein has the potential to reduce GHG emissions 
otherwise associated with livestock production. However, no study to 
date has quantified such potential.
1.5.2.5 
Food loss and waste, food security, and land use
Food loss and waste impacts food security by reducing global and 
local food availability, limiting food access due to an increase in 
food prices and a decrease of producer income, affecting future food 
production due to the unstainable use of natural resources (HLPE 
2014). Food loss is defined as the reduction of edible food during 
production, postharvest, and processing, whereas food discarded 
by consumers is considered as food waste (FAO 2011b). Combined 
food loss and waste amount to 25–30% of total food produced 
(medium confidence). During 2010–2016, global food loss and waste 
equalled 8–10% of total GHG emissions (medium confidence); and 
cost about 1 trillion USD per year (low confidence) (FAO 2014b). 
A large share of produced food is lost in developing countries due to 
poor infrastructure, while a large share of produced food is wasted 
in developed countries (Godfray et al. 2010). Changing consumer 
behaviour to reduce per capita over-consumption offers substantial 
potential to improve food security by avoiding related health burdens 
(Alexander et al. 2017; Smith 2013) and reduce emissions associated 
with the extra food (Godfray et al. 2010). In 2007, around 20% of the 
food produced went to waste in Europe and North America, while 
around 30% of the food produced was lost in Sub-Saharan Africa 
(FAO 2011b). During the last 50 years, the global food loss and waste 
increased from around 540 Mt in 1961 to 1630 Mt in 2011 (Porter 
et al. 2016). 
In 2011, food loss and waste resulted in about  8–10% of total 
anthropogenic GHG emissions. The mitigation potential of reduced 
food loss and waste from a full life-cycle perspective, for example, 
considering both food supply chain activities and land-use change, 
was estimated as 4.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (FAO 2015a, 2013b). At a global 
scale, loss and waste of milk, poultry meat, pig meat, sheep meat, 
and potatoes are associated with 3% of the global agricultural N2O 
emissions (more than 200  Gg N2O-N yr–1  or  0.06  GtCO2-eq yr–1) 
in 2009 (Reay et al. 2012). For the USA, 35% of energy use, 34% 
of blue water use, 34% of GHG emissions, 31% of land use, and 
35% of fertiliser use related to an individual’s food-related resource 
consumption were accounted for as food waste and loss in 2010 
(Birney et al. 2017). 
Similar to food waste, over-consumption (defined as food consumption 
in excess of nutrient requirements), leads to GHG emissions 
(Alexander et al. 2017). In Australia for example, over-consumption 
accounts for about 33% GHGs associated with food (Hadjikakou 
2017). In addition to GHG emissions, over-consumption can also lead 
to severe health conditions such as obesity or diabetes. Over-eating 
was found to be at least as large a contributor to food system losses 
(Alexander et al. 2017). Similarly, food system losses associated 
with consuming resource-intensive animal-based products instead 
of nutritionally comparable plant-based alternatives are defined as 
‘opportunity food losses’. These were estimated to be 96, 90, 75, 50, 
and 40% for beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs, respectively, in the 
USA (Shepon et al. 2018).
Avoiding food loss and waste will contribute to reducing emissions 
from the agriculture sector. By 2050, agricultural GHG emissions 
associated with production of food that might be wasted may 
increase to 1.9–2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (Hiç et al. 2016). When land-use 
change for agriculture expansion is also considered, halving food 
loss and waste reduces the global need for cropland area by around 
14% and GHG emissions from agriculture and land-use change by 
22–28% (4.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1) compared to the baseline scenarios by 
2050 (Bajželj et al. 2014). The GHG emissions mitigation potential of 
food loss and waste reduction would further increase when lifecycle 
analysis accounts for emissions throughout food loss and waste 
through all food system activities.
Reducing food loss and waste to zero might not be feasible. 
Therefore, appropriate options for the prevention and management 
of food waste can be deployed to reduce food loss and waste and 
to minimise its environmental consequences. Papargyropoulou et al. 
(2014) proposed the Three Rs (i.e., reduction, recovery and recycle) 
options to prevent and manage food loss and waste. A wide range of 
approaches across the food supply chain is available to reduce food 
loss and waste, consisting of technical and non-technical solutions 
(Lipinski et al. 2013). However, technical solutions (e.g., improved 
harvesting techniques, on-farm storage, infrastructure, packaging to 
keep food fresher for longer, etc.) include additional costs (Rosegrant 
et al. 2015) and may have impacts on local environments (FAO 
2018b). Additionally, all parts of food supply chains need to become 
efficient to achieve the full reduction potential of food loss and waste 
(Lipinski et al. 2013). 
Together with technical solutions, approaches (i.e.,  non-technical 
solutions) to changes in behaviours and attitudes of a wide range 
of stakeholders across the food system will play an important role in 
reducing food loss and waste. Food loss and waste can be recovered 
by distributing food surplus to groups affected by food poverty or 
converting food waste to animal feed (Vandermeersch et al. 2014). 
Unavoidable food waste can also be recycled to produce energy 
based on biological, thermal and thermochemical technologies 
(Pham et al. 2015). Additionally, strategies for reducing food loss and 
waste also need to consider gender dynamics with participation of 
females throughout the food supply chain (FAO 2018f).
In summary, reduction of food loss and waste can be considered as 
a climate change mitigation measure that provides synergies with 
food security and land use (robust evidence, medium agreement). 
Reducing food loss and waste reduces agricultural GHG emissions 
and the need for agricultural expansion for producing excess food.

improved harvesting techniques, on-farm storage, infrastructure, 
and packaging. However, the beneficial effects of reducing food loss 
and waste will vary between producers and consumers, and across 
regions. Causes of food loss (e.g., lack of refrigeration) and waste 
(e.g.,  behaviour) differ substantially in developed and developing 
countries (robust evidence, medium agreement). Additionally, food 
loss and waste cannot be avoided completely. 
1.5.2.6 
Shortening supply chains
Encouraging consumption of locally produced food and enhancing 
efficiency of food processing and transportation can, in some cases, 
minimise food loss, contribute to food security, and reduce GHG 
emissions associated with energy consumption and food loss. For 
example, Michalský and Hooda (2015), through a  quantitative 
assessment of GHG emissions of selected fruits and vegetables in 
the UK, reported that increased local production offers considerable 
emissions savings. They also highlighted that when imports are 
necessary, importing from Europe instead of the Global South can 
contribute to considerable GHG emissions savings. Similar results 
were found by Audsley et al. (2010), with exceptions for some foods, 
such as tomatoes, peppers or sheep and goat meat. Similarly, a study 
in India shows that long and fragmented supply chains, which 
lead to disrupted price signals, unequal power relations perverse 
incentives and long transport time, could be a key barrier to reducing 
post-harvest losses (CIPHET 2007).
In other cases, environmental benefits associated with local food 
can be offset by inefficient production systems with high emission 
intensity and resource needs, such as water, due to local conditions. 
For example, vegetables produced in open fields can have much 
lower GHG emissions than locally produced vegetables from heated 
greenhouses (Theurl et al. 2014). Whether locally grown food has 
a lower carbon footprint depends on the on-farm emissions intensity 
as well as the transport emissions. In some cases, imported food may 
have a lower carbon footprint than locally grown food because some 
distant countries can produce food at much lower emissions intensity. 
For example, Avetisyan et al. (2014) reported that regional variation 
of emission intensities associated with production of ruminant 
products have large implications for emissions associated with local 
food. They showed that consumption of local livestock products can 
reduce emissions due to short supply chains in countries with low 
emission intensities; however, this might not be the case in countries 
with high emission intensities. 
In addition to improving emission intensity, efficient distribution 
systems for local food are needed for lowering carbon footprints 
(Newman et al. 2013). Emissions associated with food transport 
depend on the mode of transport, for example, emissions are lower 
for rail rather than truck (Brodt et al. 2013). Tobarra et al. (2018) 
reported that emissions saving from local food may vary across 
seasons and regions of import. They highlighted that, in Spain, local 
production of fruits and vegetables can reduce emissions associated 
with imports from Africa but imports from France and Portugal can 
save emissions in comparison to production in Spain. Additionally, 
local production of seasonal products in Spain reduces emissions, 
while imports of out-of-season products can save emissions rather 
than producing them locally. 
In summary, consuming locally grown foods can reduce GHG 
emissions, if they are grown efficiently (high confidence). The 
emissions reduction potential varies by region and season. Whether 
food with shorter supply chains has a lower carbon footprint depends 
on both the on-farm emissions intensity as well as the transport 
emissions. In some cases, imported food may have a lower carbon 
footprint because some distant agricultural regions can produce food 
at lower emissions intensities.

Mitigation, adaptation, food security 
and land use: Synergies, trade-offs 
and co-benefits 
Food systems will need to adapt to changing climates and also reduce 
their GHG emissions and sequester carbon if Paris Agreement goals 
are to be met (Springmann et al. 2018a and van Vuuren et al. 2014). 
The synergies and trade-offs between the food system mitigation 
and adaptation options described in Sections  5.3 and  5.5 are of 
increasing importance in both scientific and policy communities 
because of the necessity to ensure food security,  i.e.,  providing 
nutritious food for growing populations while responding to climate 
change (Rosenzweig and Hillel 2015). A special challenge involves 
interactions between land-based non-food system mitigation, such 
as negative emissions technologies, and food security. Response 
options for the food system have synergies and trade-offs between 
climate change mitigation and adaptation (Figure 5.13; Chapter 6).
Tirado et al. (2013) suggest an integrated approach to address 
the impacts of climate change to food security that considers 
a  combination of nutrition-sensitive adaptation and mitigation 
measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive agricultural 
development, social protection, improved maternal and child care 
and health, nutrition-sensitive risk reduction and management, 
community development measures, nutrition-smart investments, 
increased policy coherence, and institutional and cross-sectoral 
collaboration. These measures are a means to achieve both short-term 
and long-term benefits in poor and marginalised groups. 
This section assesses the synergies and trade-offs for land-based 
atmospheric carbon dioxide removal measures, effects of mitigation 
measures on food prices, and links between dietary choices and 
human health. It then evaluates a range of integrated agricultural 
systems and practices that combine mitigation and adaptation 
measures, including the role of agricultural intensification. The role 
urban agriculture is examined, as well as interactions between 
SDG 2 (zero hunger) and SDG 13 (climate action).
1.6.1 
Land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
and bioenergy 
Large-scale deployment of negative emission technologies (NETs) 
in emission scenarios has been identified as necessary for avoiding 
unacceptable climate change (IPCC 2018b). Among the available NETs, 
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies are receiving increasing 
attention. Land-based CDRs include afforestation and reforestation 
(AR), sustainable forest management, biomass energy with carbon 
capture and storage (BECCS), and biochar (BC) production (Minx et al. 
2018). Most of the literature on global land-based mitigation potential 
relies on CDRs, particularly on BECCS, as a major mitigation action 
(Kraxner et al. 2014; Larkin et al. 2018 and Rogelj et al. 2018, 2015, 
2011). BECCS is not yet deployable at a significant scale, as it faces 
challenges similar to fossil fuel carbon capture and storage (CCS) (Fuss 
et al. 2016; Vaughan and Gough 2016; Nemet et al. 2018). Regardless, 
the effectiveness of large-scale BECCS to meet Paris Agreement goals 
has been questioned and other pathways to mitigation have been 
proposed (Anderson and Peters 2016; van Vuuren et al. 2017, 2018; 
Grubler et al. 2018; Vaughan and Gough 2016). 
Atmospheric CO2 removal by storage in vegetation depends on 
achieving net organic carbon accumulation in plant biomass over 
decadal time scales (Kemper 2015) and, after plant tissue decay, 
in soil organic matter (Del Grosso et al. 2019). AR, BECCS and BC 
differ in the use and storage of plant biomass. In BECCS, biomass 
carbon from plants is used in industrial processes (e.g., for electricity, 
hydrogen, ethanol, and biogas generation), releasing CO2, which is 
then captured and geologically stored (Greenberg et al. 2017; Minx 
et al. 2018). 
Afforestation and reforestation result in long-term carbon storage 
in above and belowground plant biomass on previously unforested 
areas, and is effective as a carbon sink during the AR establishment 
period, in contrast to thousands of years for geological carbon 
storage (Smith et al. 2016). 
Biochar is produced from controlled thermal decomposition of 
biomass in absence of oxygen (pyrolysis), a process that also yields 
combustible oil and combustible gas in different proportions. Biochar 
is a very stable carbon form, with storage on centennial time scales 
(Lehmann et al. 2006) (Chapter  4). Incorporated in soils, some 
authors suggest it may lead to improved water-holding capacity, 
nutrient retention, and microbial processes (Lehmann et al. 2015). 
There is, however, uncertainty about the benefits and risks of this 
practice (The Royal Society 2018).
Land-based CDRs require high biomass-producing crops. Since not 
all plant biomass is harvested (e.g., roots and harvesting losses), it 
can produce co-benefits related to soil carbon sequestration, crop 
productivity, crop quality, as well improvements in air quality, but 
the overall benefits strongly depend on the previous land-use and 
soil management practices (Smith et al. 2016; Wood et al. 2018). 
In addition, CDR effectiveness varies widely depending on type of 
biomass, crop productivity, and emissions offset in the energy system. 
Importantly, its mitigation benefits can be easily lost due to land-use 
change interactions (Harper et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 2018; Daioglou 
et al. 2019). 
Major common challenges of implementing these large-scale CDR 
solutions, as needed to stabilise global temperature at ‘well-below’ 
2°C by the end of the century, are the large investments and the 
associated significant changes in land use required. Most of the 
existing scenarios estimate the global area required for energy 
crops in the range of 109–990 Mha (IPCC 2018a), most commonly 
around 380–700  Mha (Smith et al. 2016), reaching net area 
expansion rates of up to 23.7  Mha yr–1 (IPCC 2018b). The upper 
limit implies unprecedented rates of area expansion for crops and 
forestry observed historically, for instance, as reported by FAO since 
1961 (FAOSTAT 2018). By comparison, the sum of recent worldwide 
rates of expansion in the harvested area of soybean and sugarcane 
has not exceeded 3.5 Mha yr–1 on average. Even at this rate, they 
have been the source of major concerns for their possible negative 
environmental and food security impacts (Boerema et al. 2016; Popp 
et al. 2014).

Most land area available for CDR is currently pasture, estimated 
at  3300  Mha globally (FAOSTAT 2018). However, there is low 
confidence about how much low-productivity land is actually 
available for CDR (Lambin et al. 2013 and Gibbs and Salmon 2015). 
There is also low confidence as to whether the transition to BECCS 
will take place directly on low-productivity grasslands (Johansson 
and Azar 2007), and uncertainty on the governance mechanisms 
required to avoid unwanted spill-over effects, for instance causing 
additional deforestation (Keles et al. 2018). 
Further, grasslands and rangelands may often occur in marginal 
areas, in which case, they may be exposed to climate risks, including 
periodic flooding. Grasslands and especially rangelands and savannas 
tend to predominate in less-developed regions, often bordering areas 
of natural vegetation with little infrastructure available for transport 
and processing of large quantities of CDR-generated biomass (O’Mara 
2012; Beringer et al. 2011; Haberl et al. 2010; Magdoff 2007). 
CDR-driven reductions in the available pastureland area is a scenario 
of constant or increasing global animal protein output as proposed 
by Searchinger et al. (2018). However, despite the recent reduction in 
meat consumption in western countries, this will require productivity 
improvements (Cohn et al. 2014; Strassburg et al. 2014). It would 
also result in lower emission intensities and create conditions for 
increased soil carbon stocks (de Oliveira Silva et al. 2016; Searchinger 
et al. 2018; Soussana et al. 2019, 2013). At the same time, food 
security may be threatened if land-based mitigation displaced crops 
elsewhere, especially if to regions of lower productivity potential, 
higher climatic risk, and higher vulnerability. 
There is low agreement about what are the more competitive regions 
of the world for CDRs. Smith et al. (2016) and Vaughan et al. (2018) 
identify as candidates relatively poor countries in Latin America, Africa 
and Asia (except China and India). Others indicate those regions 
may be more competitive for food production, placing Europe as 
a major BECCS exporter (Muratori et al. 2016). Economically feasible 
CDR investments are forecast to be directed to regions with high 
biomass production potential, demand for extra energy production, 
low leakage potential for deforestation and low competition for 
food production (Vaughan et al. 2018). Latin America and Africa, for 
instance, although having high biomass production potential, still 
have low domestic energy consumption (589 and 673 MTOE – 24.7 
and 28.2 EJ, respectively), with about 30% of primary energy from 
renewable sources (reaching 50% in Brazil), mainly hydropower and 
traditional biomass. 
There is high confidence that deployment of BECCS will require 
ambitious investments and policy interventions (Peters and Geden 
2017) with strong regulation and governance of bioenergy production 
to ensure protection of forests, maintain food security and enhance 
climate benefits (Burns and Nicholson 2017; Vaughan et al. 2018; 
Muratori et al. 2016), and that such conditions may be challenging for 
developing countries. Increased value of bioenergy puts pressure on 
land, ecosystem services, and the prices of agricultural commodities, 
including food (high confidence). 
There is medium confidence for the impact of CDR technologies on 
increased food prices and reduced food security, as these depend on 
several assumptions. Nevertheless, those impacts could be strong, 
with food prices doubling under certain scenario combinations (Popp 
et al. 2017). The impacts of land-mitigation policies on the reduction 
of dietary energy availability alone (without climate change impacts) 
is estimated at over 100 kcal per person per day by 2050, with highest 
regional impacts in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (Hasegawa et al.

2018) (Section 5.2). However, only limited pilot BECCS projects have 
been implemented to date (Lenzi et al. 2018). Integrated assessment 
models (IAMs) use theoretical data based on high-level studies and 
limited regional data from the few on-the-ground BECCS projects. 
Furthermore, it has been suggested that several BECCS IAM 
scenarios rely on unrealistic assumptions regarding regional climate, 
soils and infrastructure suitability (Anderson and Peters 2016), as 
well as international bioenergy trade (Lamers et al. 2011). Current 
global IAMs usually consider major trends in production potential 
and projected demand, overlooking major challenges for the 
development of a reliable international market. Such a market will 
have to be created from scratch and overcome a series of constraints, 
including trade barriers, logistics, and supply chains, as well as social, 
ecological and economic impacts (Matzenberger et al. 2015). 
In summary, there is high agreement that better assessment of 
BECCS mitigation potential would need to be based on increased 
regional, bottom-up studies of biomass potentials, socio-economic 
consequences (including on food security), and environmental 
impacts in order to develop more realistic estimates (IPCC 2018a). 
1.6.2 
Mitigation, food prices, and food security 
Food prices are the result of supply, demand and trade relations. 
Earlier studies (e.g., Nelson et al. 2009) showed that recent climate 
impacts that reduced crop productivity led to higher prices and 
increased trade of commodities between regions, with asymmetric 
impacts on producers and consumers. In terms of published scenario 
analyses, the most affected regions tend to be Sub-Saharan Africa 
and parts of Asia, but there is significant heterogeneity in results 
between countries. Relocation of production to less affected areas 
buffers these impacts to a certain extent, and offers potential for 
improvements in food production technologies (Hasegawa et al. 
2018; van Meijl et al. 2017; Wiebe et al. 2015; Lotze-Campen et al. 
2014; Valin et al. 2014; Robinson et al. 2014).
A newer, less studied impact of climate change on prices and their 
impacts on food security is the level of land-based mitigation 
necessary to stabilise global temperature. Hasegawa et al. (2018), 
using an ensemble of seven global economic models across a range 
of GHG emissions pathways and socioeconomic trajectories, 
suggested that the level of mitigation effort needed to reduce 
emissions can have a  more significant impact on prices than the 
climate impacts themselves on reduced crop yields (Figure 5.14). This 
occurs because in the models, taxing GHG emissions leads to higher 
crop and livestock prices, while land-based mitigation leads to less 
land availability for food production, potentially lower food supply, 
and therefore food price increases. 
Price increases in turn lead to reduced consumption, especially by 
vulnerable groups, or to shifts towards cheaper food, which are often 
less nutritious. This leads to significant increases in the number of 
malnourished people. Frank et al. (2017) and Fujimori et al. (2017) 
arrived at the same conclusions for the 1.5°C mitigation scenario 
using the IAM Globiom and ensembles of AgMIP global economic 
models. While the magnitude of the response differs between models, 
the results are consistent between them. In contrast, a study based 
on five global agroeconomic models highlights that the global food 
prices may not increase much when the required land for bioenergy 
is accessible on the margin of current cropland, or the feedstock does 
not have a direct completion with agricultural land (Lotze-Campen 
et al. 2014). 
These studies highlight the need for careful design of emissions 
mitigation policies in upcoming decades  – for example, targeted 
schemes encouraging more productive and resilient agricultural 
production systems and the importance of incorporating 
complementary policies (such as safety-net programmes for poverty 
alleviation) that compensate or counteract the impacts of climate 
change mitigation policies on vulnerable regions (Hasegawa et al. 
2018). Fujimori et al. (2018) showed how an inclusive policy design 
can avoid adverse side effects on food security through international 
aid, bioenergy taxes, or domestic reallocation of income. These 
strategies can shield impoverished and vulnerable people from the 
additional risk of hunger that would be caused by the economic 
effects of policies narrowly focussing on climate objectives only. 
In summary, food security will be threatened through increasing 
numbers of malnourished people if land-based mitigation raises 
prices, unless other policy mechanisms reduce its impact (high 
confidence). Inclusive policy design can avoid adverse side effects on 
food security by shielding vulnerable people from the additional risk 
of hunger that would be caused by the economic effects of policies 
narrowly focusing on climate objectives (medium confidence).
1.6.3 
Environmental and health effects of adopting 
healthy and sustainable diets
Two key questions arise from the potentially significant mitigation 
potential of dietary change: (i) Are ‘low-GHG emission diets’ likely 
to be beneficial for health? and (ii) Would changing diets at scale 
provide substantial benefits? In short, what are the likely synergies 
and trade-offs between low-GHG emissions diets and food security, 
health, and climate change? See Supplementary Material Section 
SM5.4 for further discussion. 
Are ‘low GHG emission diets’ healthy? Consistent evidence 
indicates that, in general, a  dietary pattern that is higher in 
plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, 
legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods, is more 
health-promoting and associated with lower environmental impact 
(GHG emissions and energy,  land and water use) than either the 
current global average diets (Swinburn et al. 2019; Willett et al. 2019; 
Springmann et al. 2016b), or the current average USA diet (Nelson 
et al. 2016). Another study (Van Mierlo et al. 2017) showed that 
nutritionally-equivalent diets can substitute plant-based foods for 
meat and provide reductions in GHG emissions.
There are several studies that estimate health adequacy and 
sustainability and conclude that healthy sustainable diets are possible. 
These include global studies (e.g., Willett et al. 2019; Swinburn et al. 
500
Chapter 5 
Food security
5
2019), as well as localised studies (e.g., Van Dooren et al. 2014). For 
example, halving consumption of meat, dairy products and eggs in 
the European Union would achieve a 40% reduction in ammonia 
emissions, 25–40% reduction in non-CO2 GHG emissions (primarily 
from agriculture) and 23% per capita less use of cropland for food 
production, with dietary changes lowering health risks (Westhoek 
et al. 2014). In China, diets were designed that could meet dietary 
guidelines while creating significant reductions in GHG emissions 
(between 5% and 28%, depending on scenario) (Song et al. 2017). 
Changing diets can also reduce non-dietary related health issues 
caused by emissions of air pollutants. For example, specific changes 
in diets were assessed for their potential to mitigate PM 2.5 in China 
(Zhao et al. 2017b).
Some studies are starting to estimate both health and environmental 
benefits from dietary shifts. For example, Farchi et al. (2017) estimate 
health (colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease) and GHG outcomes 
of ‘Mediterranean’ diets in Italy, and found the potential to reduce 
deaths from colorectal cancer of 7–10% and CVD from 9–10%, as 
well as potential savings of up to 263 CO2-eq per person per year. 
In the USA, Hallström et al. (2017) found that adoption of healthier 
diets (consistent with dietary guidelines, and reducing amounts of 
red and processed meats) could reduce relative risk of coronary 
heart disease, colorectal cancer, and type 2  diabetes by 20–45%, 
USA healthcare costs by 77–93 billion USD per year, and direct GHG 
emissions by 222–826 kg CO2-eq per person per year (69–84 kg from 
the healthcare system, 153–742 kg from the food system). Broadly 
similar conclusions were found for the Netherlands (Biesbroek et al. 
2014); and the UK (Friel et al. 2009 and Milner et al. 2015). 
Whilst for any given disease, there are a range of factors, including 
diet, that can affect it, and evidence is stronger for some diseases 
than others, a  recent review found that an overall trend toward 
increased cancer risk was associated with unhealthy dietary patterns, 
suggesting that diet-related choices could significantly affect the 
risk of cancer (Grosso et al. 2017). Tilman and Clark (2014) found 
significant benefits in terms of reductions in relative risk of key 
diseases: type 2 diabetes, cancer, coronary mortality and all causes 
of mortality (Figure 5.15). 
1.6.3.1 
Can dietary shifts provide significant benefits? 
Many studies now indicate that dietary shifts can significantly reduce 
GHG emissions. For instance, several studies highlight that if current 
dietary trends are maintained, this could lead to emissions from 
agriculture of approximately 20  GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050, creating 
significant mitigation potential (Pradhan et al. 2013b; Bajželj et al. 
2014; Hedenus et al. 2014; Bryngelsson et al. 2017). Additionally in 
the USA, a shift in consumption towards a broadly healthier diet, 
combined with meeting the USDA and Environmental Protection 
Agency’s 2030 food loss and waste reduction goals, could increase 
per capita food-related energy use by 12%, decrease blue water 
consumption by 4%, decrease green water use by 23%, decrease 
GHG emissions from food production by 11%, decrease GHG 
emissions from landfills by 20%, decrease land use by 32%, and 
increase fertiliser use by 12% (Birney et al. 2017). This study, however, 
does not account for all potential routes to emissions, ignoring, for 
example, fertiliser use in feed production. Similar studies have been 
conducted, for China (Li et al. 2016), where adoption of healthier 
diets and technology improvements have the potential to reduce 
food systems GHG emissions by >40% relative to those in 2010; and 
India (Green et al. 2017; Vetter et al. 2017), where alternative diet 
scenarios can affect emissions from the food system by –20 to +15%.
Springmann et al.(2018a) modelled the role of technology, waste 
reduction and dietary change in living within planetary boundaries 
(Rockström et al. 2009), with the climate change boundary being 
a 66% chance of limiting warming to less than 2°C. They found that 
all are necessary for the achievement of a sustainable food system. 
Their principal conclusion is that only by adopting a ‘flexitarian diet’, 
as a global average, would climate change be limited to under two 
degrees. Their definition of a flexitarian diet is fruits and vegetables, 
plant-based proteins, modest amounts of animal-based proteins, 
and limited amounts of red meat, refined sugar, saturated fats, and 
starchy foods.
Healthy and sustainable diets address both health and environmental 
concerns (Springmann et al. 2018b). There is high agreement that 
there are significant opportunities to achieve both objectives 
simultaneously. Contrasting results of marginal GHG emissions, that 
is,  variations in emissions as a  result of variation in one or more 
dietary components, are found when comparing low to high emissions 
in self-selected diets (diets freely chosen by consumers). Vieux et al. 
(2013) found self-selected healthier diets with higher amounts of 
plant-based food products did not result in lower emissions, while 
(Rose et al. 2019) found that the lowest emission diets analysed 
were lower in meat but higher in oil, refined grains and added sugar. 
Vieux et al. (2018) concluded that setting nutritional goals with no 
consideration for the environment may increase GHG emissions. 
Tukker et al. (2011) also found a slight increase in emissions by shifting 
diets towards the European dietary guidelines, even with lower meat 
consumption. Heller and Keoleian (2015) found a 12% increase in 
GHG emissons when shifting to iso-caloric diets, defined as diets with 
the same caloric intake of diets currently consumed, following the 
USA guidelines and a 1% decrease in GHG emissions when adjusting 
caloric intake to recommended levels for moderate activity. There is 
scarce information on the marginal GHG emissions that would be 
associated with following dietary guidelines in developing countries.
Some studies have found a  modest mitigation potential of diet 
shifts when economic and biophysical systems effects are taken into 
account in association with current dietary guidelines. Tukker et al. 
(2011), considering economic rebound effects of diet shifts (i.e., part 
of the gains would be lost due to increased use at lower prices), found 
maximum changes in emissions of the EU food system of 8% (less 
than 2% of total EU emissions) when reducing meat consumption 
by 40 to 58%. Using an economic optimisation model for studying 
carbon taxation in food but with adjustments of agricultural 
production systems and commodity markets in Europe, Zech and 
Schneider (2019) found a reduction of 0.41% in GHG emissions at 
a tax level of 50 USD per tCO2-eq. They estimate a leakage of 43% of 
the GHG emissions reduced by domestic consumption, (i.e., although 
reducing emissions due to reducing consumption, around 43% of 
501
Food security 
Chapter 5
5
the emissions would not be reduced because part of the production 
would be directed to exports). 
Studying optimised beef production systems intensification 
technologies in a scenario of no grasslands area expansion de Oliveira 
Silva et al. (2016) found marginal GHG emissions to be negligible in 
response to beef demand in the Brazilian Cerrado. This was because 
reducing productivity would lead to increased emission intensities, 
cancelling out the effect of reduced consumption.
In summary, there is significant potential mitigation (high 
confidence) arising from the adoption of diets in line with dietary 
recommendations made on the basis of health. These are broadly 
similar across most countries. These are typically capped at the 
number of calories and higher in plant-based foods, such as 
vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and lower 
in animal-sourced foods, fats and sugar. Such diets have the potential 
to be both more sustainable and healthier than alternative diets (but 
healthy diets are not necessarily sustainable and vice versa). The 
extent to which the mitigation potential of dietary choices can be 
realised requires both climate change and health being considered 
together. Socio-economic (prices, rebound effects), political, and 
cultural contexts would require significant consideration to enable 
this mitigation potential to be realised.
1.6.4 
Sustainable integrated agricultural systems
A range of integrated agricultural systems are being tested to 
evaluate synergies between mitigation and adaptation and lead 
to low-carbon and climate-resilient pathways for sustainable 
food security and ecosystem health (robust evidence, medium 
agreement). Integration refers to the use of practices that enhance an 
agroecosystem’s mitigation, resilience, and sustainability functions. 
These systems follow holistic approaches with the objective of 
achieving biophysical, socio-cultural, and economic benefits from 
land management systems (Sanz et al. 2017). These integrated 
systems may include agroecology (FAO et al. 2018; Altieri et al. 2015), 
climate smart agriculture (FAO 2011c; Lipper et al. 2014; Aggarwal 
et al. 2018), conservation agriculture (Aryal et al. 2016; Sapkota et al. 
2015), and sustainable intensification (FAO 2011d; Godfray 2015), 
amongst others. 
Many of these systems are complementary in some of their practices, 
although they tend to be based on different narratives (Wezel et al. 
2015; Lampkin et al. 2015; Pimbert 2015). They have been tested in 
various production systems around the world (Dinesh et al. 2017; 
Jat et al. 2016; Sapkota et al. 2015 and Neufeldt et al. 2013). Many 
technical innovations, for example, precision nutrient management 
(Sapkota et al. 2014) and precision water management (Jat et al. 
2015), can lead to both adaptation and mitigation outcomes and 
even synergies; although negative adaptation and mitigation 
outcomes (i.e., trade-offs) are often overlooked. Adaptation potential 
of ecologically intensive systems includes crop diversification, 
maintaining local genetic diversity, animal integration, soil organic 
management, water conservation and harvesting the role of microbial 
assemblages (Section 5.3). Technical innovations may encompass not 
only inputs reduction, but complete redesign of agricultural systems 
(Altieri et al. 2017) and how knowledge is generated (Levidow et al. 
2014), including social and political transformations.
1.6.4.1 
Agroecology
Agroecology (see Glossary) (Francis et al. 2003; Gliessman and 
Engles 2014; Gliessman 2018), provides knowledge for their design 
and management, including social, economic, political, and cultural 
dimensions (Dumont et al. 2016). It started with a focus at the farm 
level but has expanded to include the range of food system activities 
(Benkeblia 2018). Agroecology builds systems resilience through 
knowledge-intensive practices relying on traditional farming systems 
and co-generation of new insights and information with stakeholders 
through participatory action research (Menéndez et al. 2013). It 
provides a multidimensional view of food systems within ecosystems, 
building on ILK and co-evolving with the experiences of local people, 
available natural resources, access to these resources, and ability to 
share and pass on knowledge among communities and generations, 
emphasising the inter-relatedness of all agroecosystem components 
and the complex dynamics of ecological processes (Vandermeer 1995). 
At the farm level, agroecological practices recycle biomass and 
regenerate soil biotic activities. They strive to attain balance in 
nutrient flows to secure favourable soil and plant growth conditions, 
minimise loss of water and nutrients, and improve use of solar 
radiation. Practices include efficient microclimate management, 
soil cover, appropriate planting time and genetic diversity. They 
seek to promote ecological processes and services such as nutrient 
cycling, balanced predator/prey interactions, competition, symbiosis, 
and successional changes. The overall goal is to benefit human 
and non-human communities in the ecological sphere, with fewer 
negative environmental or social impacts and fewer external inputs 
(Vandermeer et al. 1998; Altieri et al. 1998). From a  food system 
focus, agroecology provides management options in terms of 
commercialisation and consumption through the promotion of short 
food chains and healthy diets (Pimbert and Lemke 2018; Loconto 
et al. 2018).
Agroecology has been proposed as a key set of practices in building 
climate resilience (FAO et al. 2018; Altieri et al. 2015). These can 
enhance on-farm diversity (of genes, species, and ecosystems) 
through a landscape approach (FAO 2018g). Outcomes include soil 
conservation and restoration and thus soil carbon sequestration, 
reduction of the use of mineral and chemical fertilisers, watershed 
protection, promotion of local food systems, waste reduction, and 
fair access to healthy food through nutritious and diversified diets 
(Pimbert and Lemke 2018; Kremen et al. 2012; Goh 2011; Gliessman 
and Engles 2014). 
A principle in agroecology is to contribute to food production by 
smallholder farmers (Altieri 2002). Since climatic events can severely 
impact smallholder farmers, there is a  need to better understand 
the heterogeneity of small-scale agriculture in order to consider 
the diversity of strategies that traditional farmers have used and 
still use to deal with climatic variability. In Africa, many smallholder 
farmers cope with and even prepare for climate extremes, 
502

minimising crop failure through a series of agroecological practices 
(e.g.,  biodiversification, soil management, and water harvesting) 
(Mbow et al. 2014a). Resilience to extreme climate events is also 
linked to on-farm biodiversity, a typical feature of traditional farming 
systems (Altieri and Nicholls 2017). 
Critiques of agroecology refer to its explicit exclusion of modern 
biotechnology (Kershen 2013) and the assumption that smallholder 
farmers are a  uniform unit with no heterogeneity in power (and 
thus gender) relationships (Neira and Montiel 2013; Siliprandi and 
Zuluaga Sánchez 2014).
1.6.4.2 
Climate-smart agriculture
 ‘Climate-smart agriculture’ (CSA) is an approach developed to tackle 
current food security and climate change challenges in a joint and 
synergistic fashion (Lipper et al. 2014; Aggarwal et al. 2018; FAO 
2013c). CSA is designed to be a pathway towards development and 
food security built on three pillars: increasing productivity and incomes, 
enhancing resilience of livelihoods and ecosystems and reducing, 
and removing GHG emissions from the atmosphere (FAO 2013c). 
Climate-smart agricultural systems are integrated approaches to the 
closely linked challenges of food security, development, and climate 
change adaptation/mitigation to enable countries to identify options 
with maximum benefits and those where trade-offs need management. 
Many agricultural practices and technologies already provide 
proven benefits to farmers’ food security, resilience and productivity 
(Dhanush and Vermeulen 2016). In many cases, these can be 
implemented by changing the suites of management practices. For 
example, enhancing soil organic matter to improve the water-holding 
capacity of agricultural landscapes also sequesters carbon. In annual 
cropping systems, changes from conventional tillage practices to 
minimum tillage can convert the system from one that either provides 
adaptation or mitigation benefits or neither to one that provides both 
adaptation and mitigation benefits (Sapkota et al. 2017a; Harvey 
et al. 2014a). 
Increasing food production by using more fertilisers in agricultural 
fields could maintain crop yield in the face of climate change, but 
may  result in greater overall GHG emissions. But increasing or 
maintaining the same level of yield by increasing nutrient-use-
efficiency through adoption of better fertiliser management practices 
could contribute to both food security and climate change mitigation 
(Sapkota et al. 2017a). 
Mixed farming systems integrating crops, livestock, fisheries and 
agroforestry could maintain crop yield in the face of climate change, 
help the system to adapt to climatic risk, and minimise GHG 
emissions by increasingly improving the nutrient flow in the system 
(Mbow et al. 2014a; Newaj et al. 2016; Bioversity International 
2016). Such systems can help diversify production and/or incomes 
and support efficient and timely use of inputs, thus contributing to 
increased resilience, but they require local seed and input systems 
and extension services. Recent whole farm modelling exercises have 
shown the economic and environmental (reduced GH emissions, 
reduced land use) benefits of integrated crop-livestock systems (Gil 
et al. 2018) compared different soy-livestock systems across multiple 
economic and environmental indicators, including climate resilience. 
However, it is important to note that potential benefits are very 
context specific. 
Although climate-smart agriculture involves a  holistic approach, 
some argue that it narrowly focuses on technical aspects at the 
production level (Taylor 2018; Newell and Taylor 2018). Studying 
barriers to the adoption and diffusion of technological innovations 
for climate-smart agriculture in Europe, Long et al. (2016) found 
that there was incompatibility between existing policies and 
climate-smart agriculture objectives, including barriers to the 
adoption of technological innovations. 
Climate-smart agricultural systems recognise that the implementation 
of the potential options will be shaped by specific country contexts 
and capacities, as well as enabled by access to better information, 
aligned policies, coordinated institutional arrangements and flexible 
incentives and financing mechanisms (Aggarwal et al. 2018). 
Attention to underlying socio-economic factors that affect adoption 
of practices and access to technologies is crucial for enhancing 
biophysical processes, increasing productivity, and reducing GHG 
emissions at scale. The Government of India, for example, has started 
a programme of climate resilient villages (CRV) as a learning platform 
to design, implement, evaluate and promote various climate-smart 
agricultural interventions, with the goal of ensuring enabling 
mechanisms at the community level (Srinivasa Rao et al. 2016).
1.6.4.3 
Conservation agriculture
Conservation agriculture (CA) is based on the principles of minimum 
soil disturbance and permanent soil cover, combined with appropriate 
crop rotation (Jat et al. 2014; FAO 2011e). CA has been shown to 
respond with positive benefits to smallholder farmers under both 
economic and environmental pressures (Sapkota et al. 2017a, 2015). 
This agricultural production system uses a body of soil and residues 
management practices that control erosion (Blanco Sepúlveda and 
Aguilar Carrillo 2016) and at the same time improve soil quality, by 
increasing organic matter content and improving porosity, structural 
stability, infiltration and water retention (Sapkota et al. 2017a, 2015 
and Govaerts et al. 2009).
Intensive agriculture during the second half of the 20th century led 
to soil degradation and loss of natural resources and contributed to 
climate change. Sustainable soil management practices can address 
both food security and climate change challenges faced by these 
agricultural systems. For example, sequestration of soil organic 
carbon (SOC) is an important strategy to improve soil quality and 
to mitigation of climate change (Lal 2004). CA has been reported 
to increase farm productivity by reducing costs of production (Aryal 
et al. 2015; Sapkota et al. 2015; Indoria et al. 2017) as well as to 
reduce GHG emission (Pratibha et al. 2016). 
Conservation agriculture brings favourable changes in soil properties 
that affect the delivery of nature’s contribution to people (NCPs) 
or ecosystem services, including climate regulation through carbon 
sequestration and GHG emissions (Palm et al. 2013; Sapkota et al. 
503
Food security 
Chapter 5
5
2017a). However, by analysing datasets for soil carbon in the tropics, 
Powlson et al. (2014, 2016) argued that the rate of SOC increase 
and resulting GHG mitigation in CA systems, from zero-tillage in 
particular, has been overstated (Chapter 2). 
However, there is unanimous agreement that the gain in SOC and 
its contribution to GHG mitigation by CA in any given soil is largely 
determined by the quantity of organic matter returned to the soil 
(Giller et al. 2009; Virto et al. 2011; Sapkota et al. 2017b). Thus, 
a careful analysis of the production system is necessary to minimise 
the trade-offs among the multiple use of residues, especially where 
residues remain an integral part of livestock feeding (Sapkota 
et al. 2017b). Similarly, replacing mono-cropping systems with more 
diversified cropping systems and agroforestry, as well as afforestation 
and deforestation, can buffer temperatures as well as increase carbon 
storage (Mbow et al. 2014a; Bioversity International 2016), and 
provide diversified and healthy diets in the face of climate change. 
Adoption of conservation agriculture in Africa has been low despite 
more than three decades of implementation (Giller et al. 2009), 
although there is promising uptake recently in east and southern 
Africa. This calls for a  better understanding of the social and 
institutional aspects around CA adoption. Brown et al. (2017a) found 
that institutional and community constraints hampered the use of 
financial, physical, human and informational resources to implement 
CA programmes. 
Gender plays an important role at the intra-household level in 
regard to decision-making and distributing benefits. Conservation 
agriculture interventions have implications for labour requirements, 
labour allocation, and investment decisions, all of which impact the 
roles of men and women (Farnworth et al. 2016) (Section  5.1.3). 
For example, in the Global South, CA generally reduces labour and 
production costs and generally leads to increased returns to family 
labour (Aryal et al. 2015) although a  gender shift of the labour 
burden to women have also been described (Giller et al. 2009).
1.6.4.4 
Sustainable intensification
The need to produce about 50% more food by 2050, required to 
feed the increasing world population (FAO 2018a), may come at the 
price of significant increases in GHG emissions and environmental 
impacts, including loss of biodiversity. For instance, land conversion 
for agriculture is responsible for an estimated  8–10% of all 
anthropogenic GHG emissions currently (Section 5.4). Recent calls for 
sustainable intensification (SI) are based on the premise that damage 
to the environment through extensification outweighs benefits 
of extra food produced on new lands (Godfray 2015). However, 
increasing the net production area by restoring already degraded 
land may contribute to increased production on the one hand and 
increased carbon sequestration on the other (Jat et al. 2016), thereby 
contributing to both increased agricultural production and improved 
natural capital outcomes (Pretty et al. 2018). 
Sustainable intensification is a  goal but does not specify a  priori 
how it could be attained, for example, which agricultural techniques 
to deploy (Garnett et al. 2013). It can be combined with selected 
other improved management practices, for example, conservation 
agriculture (see above), or agroforestry, with additional economic, 
ecosystem services, and carbon benefits. Sustainable intensification, 
by improving nutrient, water, and other input-use efficiency, not only 
helps to close yield gaps and contribute to food security (Garnett 
et al. 2013), but also reduces the loss of such production inputs and 
associated emissions (Sapkota et al. 2017c; Wollenberg et al. 2016). 
Closing yield gaps is a way to become more efficient in use of land per 
unit production. Currently, most regions in Africa and South Asia have 
attained less than 40% of their potential crop production (Pradhan 
et al. 2015). Integrated farming systems (e.g., mixed crop/livestock,

crop/aquaculture) are strategies to produce more products per unit 
land, which in regard to food security, becomes highly relevant.
Sustainable intensification acknowledges that enhanced productivity 
needs to be accompanied by maintenance of other ecosystem 
services and enhanced resilience to shocks (Vanlauwe et al. 2014). 
SI in intensively farmed areas may require a reduction in production 
in favour of increasing sustainability in the broad sense (Buckwell 
et al. 2014) (Cross-Chapter Box  6 in Chapter 5). Hence, moving 
towards sustainability may imply lower yield growth rates than those 
maximally attainable in such situations. For areas that contain valuable 
natural ecosystems, such as the primary forest in the Congo basin, 
intensification of agriculture is one of the pillars of the strategy to 
conserve forest (Vanlauwe et al. 2014). Intensification in agriculture is 
recognised as one of the pathways to meet food security and climate 
change adaptation and mitigation goals (Sapkota et al. 2017c). 
However, SI does not always confer co-benefits in terms of food 
security and climate change adaption/mitigation. For example, in 
the case of Vietnam, intensified production of rice and pigs reduced 
GHG emissions in the short term through land sparing, but after two 
decades, the emissions associated with higher inputs were likely 
to outweigh the savings from land sparing (Thu Thuy et al. 2009). 
Intensification needs to be sustainable in all components of food 
system by curbing agricultural sprawl, rebuilding soils, restoring 
degraded lands, reducing agricultural pollution, increasing water use 
efficiency, and decreasing the use of external inputs (Cook et al. 2015). 
A study conducted by Palm et al. (2010) in Sub-Saharan Africa, reported 
that, at low population densities and high land availability, food 
security and climate mitigation goals can be met with intensification 
scenarios, resulting in surplus crop area for reforestation. In contrast, 
for high population density and small farm sizes, attaining food 
security and reducing GHG emissions require the use of more 
mineral fertilisers to make land available for reforestation. However, 
some forms of intensification in drylands can increase rather than 
reduce vulnerability due to adverse effects such as environmental 
degradation and increased social inequity (Robinson et al. 2015).
Sustainable intensification has been critiqued for considering food 
security only from the supply side, whereas global food security requires 
attention to all aspects of food system, including access, utilisation, 
and stability (Godfray 2015). Further, adoption of high-input forms of 
agriculture under the guise of simultaneously improving yields and 
environmental performance will attract more investment leading to 
higher rate of adoption but with the environmental component of 
SI quickly abandoned (Godfray 2015). Where adopted, SI needs to 
engage with the sustainable development agenda to (i) identify SI 
agricultural practices that strengthen rural communities, improve 
smallholder livelihoods and employment, and avoid negative social 
and cultural impacts, including loss of land tenure and forced 
migration; (ii) invest in the social, financial, natural, and physical 
capital needed to facilitate SI implementation; and (iii) develop 
mechanisms to pay poor farmers for undertaking sustainability 
measures (e.g., GHG emissions mitigation or biodiversity protection) 
that may carry economic costs (Garnett et al. 2013).
In summary, integrated agricultural systems and practices can 
enhance food system resilience to climate change and reduce GHG 
emissions, while helping to achieve sustainability (high confidence).

Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1 |  There is a need to balance increasing demands for food, fuel and fibre with long-term sustainability

potentially allows the sparing of land to provide other ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and the protection of biodiversity. However, the 
potential for SI is system specific and may change through time (indicated by grey arrows). Current practice may already be outside of this window and be 
unsustainable in terms of negative impacts on the long-term sustainability of the system.

Introduction 
The projected demand for more food, fuel and fibre for 
a  growing human population necessitates intensification 
of current land use to avoid conversion of additional land 
to agriculture and potentially allow the sparing of land 
to provide other ecosystem services, including carbon 
sequestration, production of biomass for energy,  and the 
protection of biodiversity (Benton et al. 2018; Garnett et al. 
2013). Land-use intensity may be defined in terms of three 
components; (i) intensity of system inputs (land/soil, capital, 
labour, knowledge,  nutrients and other chemicals), (ii) 
intensity of system outputs (yield per unit land area or per 
specific input) and (iii) the impacts of land use on ecosystem 
services such as changes in soil carbon or biodiversity (Erb 
et al. 2013). Intensified land use can lead to ecological 
damage as well as degradation of soil, resulting in a loss 
of function which underpins many ecosystem services 
(Wilhelm and Smith 2018; Smith et al. 2016). Therefore, there 
is a  risk that increased agricultural intensification could 
deliver short-term production goals at the expense of future 
productive potential, jeopardising long term food security 
(Tilman et al. 2011). 
Agroecosystems which maintain or improve the natural 
and human capital and services they provide may be 
defined as sustainable systems, while those which deplete 
these assets as unsustainable (Pretty and Bharucha 2014). 
Producing more food, fuel and fibre without the conversion 
of additional non-agricultural land while simultaneously 
reducing environmental impacts requires what has been 
termed sustainable intensification (Godfray et al. 2010; FAO 
2011e) (Glossary and Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). 
Sustainable intensification (SI) may be achieved through 
a wide variety of means; from improved nutrient and water 
use efficiency via plant and animal breeding programmes, 
to the implementation of integrated soil fertility and pest 
management practices, as well as by smarter land-use 
allocation at a  larger spatial scale: for example, matching 
land use to the context and specific capabilities of the 
land (Benton et al. 2018). However, implementation of SI 
is broader than simply increasing the technical efficiency 
of agriculture  (‘doing more with less’). It sometimes may 
require a  reduction of yields to raise sustainability, and 
successful implementation can be dependent on place and 
scale. Pretty et al. (2018), following Hill (1985), highlights 
three elements to SI: (i) increasing efficiency, (ii) substitution 
of less beneficial or efficient practices for better ones, and (iii) 
system redesign to adopt new practices and farming systems 
(Table 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box). 
Under a land sparing strategy, intensification of land use in 
some areas, generating higher productivity per unit area of 
land, can allow other land to provide other ecosystem services, 
such as increased carbon sequestration and the conservation 
of natural ecosystems and biodiversity (Balmford et al. 2018 
and Strassburg et al. 2014). Conversely under a land sharing 
strategy, less, or  no,  land is set aside, but lower levels of 
intensification are applied to agricultural land, providing 
a combination of provisioning and other functions such as 
biodiversity conservation from the same land (Green et al. 
2005). The two approaches are not mutually exclusive and 
the suitability of their application is generally system-, scale- 
and/or location-specific (Fischer et al. 2014). One crucial issue 
for the success of a land sparing strategy is that spared land 
is protected from further conversion. As the profits from the 
intensively managed land increase, there is an incentive for 
conversion of additional land for production (Byerlee et al. 
2014). Furthermore, it is implicit that there are limits to the SI 
of land at a local and also planetary boundary level (Rockström 
et al. 2009). These may relate to the ‘health’ of soil, the 
presence of supporting services, such as pollination, local limits 
to water availability, or limits on air quality. This implies that it 
may not be possible to meet demand ‘sustainably’ if demand 
exceeds local and global limits. There are no single global 
solutions to these challenges and specific in situ responses for 
different farming systems and locations are required. Bajželj 
et al. (2014) showed that implementation of SI, primarily 
through yield gap closure, had better environmental outcomes 
compared with ‘business as usual’ trajectories. However, SI 
alone will not be able to deliver the necessary environmental 
outcomes from the food system – dietary change and reduced 
food waste are also required (Springmann et al. 2018a; Bajželj 
et al. 2014).

Improved efficiency – example of precision agriculture 
Precision farming usually refers to optimising production 
in fields through site-specific choices of crop varieties, 
agrochemical application, precise water management 
(e.g., in given areas or threshold moistures) and management 
of crops at a small scale (or livestock as individuals) (Hedley 
2015). Precision agriculture has the potential to achieve 
higher yields in a  more efficient and  sustainable manner 
compared with traditional low-precision methods.
Precision agriculture
Precision agriculture is a technologically advanced approach 
that uses continual monitoring of crop and livestock 
performance to actively inform management practices. 
Precise monitoring of crop performance over the course of 
the growing season will enable farmers to economise on their 
inputs in terms of water, nutrients and pest management. 
Therefore, it can contribute to both the food security (by 
maintaining yields), sustainability (by reducing unnecessary 
inputs) and land sparing goals associated with SI. The 
site-specific management of weeds allows a more efficient 
application of herbicide to specific weed patches within 
crops (Jensen et al. 2012). Such precision weed control has 
resulted in herbicide savings of 19–22% for winter oilseed 
rape, 46–57% for sugar beet and 60–77% for winter wheat 
production (Gutjahr and Gerhards 2010). The use of on-farm 
sensors for real time management of crop and livestock 
performance can enhance farm efficiency (Aqeel-Ur-Rehman 
et al. 2014). Mapping soil nutrition status can allow for more 
targeted, and therefore more effective, nutrient management 
practices (Hedley 2015). Using wireless sensors to monitor 
environmental conditions, such as soil moisture, has the 
potential to allow more efficient crop irrigation (Srbinovska 
et al. 2015). Controlled traffic farming, where farm machinery 
is confined to permanent tracks, using automatic steering 
and satellite guidance, increases yields by minimising soil 
compaction. However, barriers to the uptake of many of these 
high-tech precision agriculture technologies remain. In what 
is described as the ‘implementation problem’, despite the 
potential to collect vast quantities of data on crop or livestock 
performance, applying these data to inform management 
decisions remains a challenge (Lindblom et al. 2017).
Low-tech precision agriculture 
The principle of precision agriculture can be applied 
equally to low capital-input farming, in the form 
of 
low-tech 
precision 
agriculture 
(Conway 
2013). 
The principle is the same, but instead of adopting 
capital-heavy equipment (such as sensor technology  
connected to the ‘internet of things’, or large machinery and 
expensive inputs), farmers use knowledge and experience 
and re-purposed innovative approaches, such as a  bottle 
cap as a fertiliser measure for each plant, applied by hand 
(Mondal and Basu 2009). This type of precision agriculture 
is particularly relevant to small-scale farming in the Global 
South, where capital investment is major limiting factor. For 
example, the application of a simple seed priming technique 
resulted in a  20 to 30% increase in yields of  pearl millet 
and sorghum in semi-arid West Africa (Aune et al. 2017). 
Low-tech precision agriculture has the potential to increase 
the economic return per unit land area while also creating 
new employment opportunities.

Sustainable intensification through farming system 
redesign
Sustainable 
intensification 
requires 
equal 
weight 
to 
be 
placed 
on 
the 
sustainability 
and 
intensification 
components 
(Benton 
2016; 
Garnett 
et al. 2013). Figure 1 in this Cross-Chapter Box outlines the 
trade-offs which SI necessitates between the intensity of 
land use against long-term sustainability. One approach to 
this challenge is through farming system redesign, including 
increased diversification. 
Diversification of intensively managed systems 
Incorporating higher levels of plant diversity in agroecosystems 
can improve the sustainability of farming systems (Isbell et al. 
2017). Where intensive land use has led to land degradation, 
more diverse land-use systems, such as intercropping, can 
provide a more sustainable land-use option with co-benefits 
for food security, adaptation and mitigation objectives. For 
example, in temperate regions, highly productive agricultural 
grasslands used to produce meat and dairy products 
are characterised by monoculture pastures with high 
agrochemical inputs. Multi-species grasslands may provide 
a route to SI, as even a modest increase in species richness 
in intensively managed grasslands can result in higher forage 
yields without increased inputs, such as chemical fertiliser 
(Finn et al. 2013; Sanderson et al. 2013; Tilman et al. 2011). 
Recent evidence also indicates multispecies grasslands have 
greater resilience to drought, indicating co-benefits for 
adaptation (Hofer et al. 2016; Haughey et al. 2018). 
Diversification of production systems
Agroforestry systems (see Glossary) can promote regional 
food security and provide many additional ecosystem 
services when compared with monoculture crop systems. 
Co-benefits for mitigation and adaptation include increased 
carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, improved water 
and nutrient use efficiency and the creation of favourable 
micro-climates (Waldron et al. 2017). Silvopasture systems, 
which combine grazing of livestock and forestry, are 
particularly useful in reducing land degradation where the 
risk of soil erosion is high (Murgueitio et al. 2011). Crop and 
livestock systems can also be combined to provide multiple 
services. Perennial wheat derivatives produced both high 
quality forage and substantial volumes of cereal grains 
508

(Newell and Hayes 2017), and show promise for integrating 
cereal and livestock production while sequestering soil 
carbon (Ryan et al. 2018). A key feature of diverse production 
systems is the provision of multiple income streams for 
farming households,  providing much needed economic 
resilience in the face of fluctuation of crop yields and prices.
 
Cross-Chapter Box 6 (continued)
Landscape approaches 
The land sparing and land sharing approaches which may be 
used to implement SI are inherently ‘landscape approaches’ 
(e.g., Hodgson et al. 2010). While the term landscape is by no 
means precise (Englund et al. 2017), landscape approaches, 
focused, for example, at catchment scale, are generally 
agreed to be the best way to tackle competing demands 
for land (e.g.,  Sayer  et al. 2013), and are the appropriate 
scale at which to focus the implementation of sustainable 
intensification. The landscape approach allots land to 
various uses  – cropping, intensive and extensive grazing, 
forestry, mining, conservation, recreation, urban, industry, 
infrastructure  – through a  planning process that seeks 
to balance conservation and production objectives. With 
respect to SI, a landscape approach is pertinent to achieving 
potential benefits for biodiversity conservation, ensuring that 
land ‘spared’ through SI remains protected, and that adverse 
impacts of agriculture on conservation land are minimised. 
Depending on the land governance mechanisms applied in 
the jurisdiction, different approaches will be appropriate/
required. However, benefits are  only assured if land-use 
restrictions are devised and enforced.
Summary
Intensification needs to be achieved sustainably, necessitating 
a balance between productivity today and future potential 
(high agreement, medium evidence). Improving the efficiency 
of agriculture systems can increase production per unit of 
land through more effective resource use. To achieve SI, 
some intensively managed agricultural systems may have to 
be diversified as they cannot be further intensified without 
land degradation. A combination of land sparing and sharing 
options can be utilised to achieve SI – their application is 
most likely to succeed if applied using a landscape approach.
1.6.5 
Role of urban agriculture
Cities are an important actor in the food system through demand for 
food by urban dwellers and production of food in urban and peri-urban 
areas (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2). Both the demand side and 
supply side roles are important relative to climate change mitigation 
and adaptation strategies. Urban areas are home to more than half of 
the world’s population, and a minimal proportion of the production. 
Thus, they are important drivers for the development of the complex 
food systems in place today, especially with regard to supply chains 
and dietary preferences. 
The increasing separation of urban and rural populations with regard 
to territory and culture is one of the factors favouring the nutrition 
transition towards urban diets (Weber and Matthews 2008; Neira 
et al. 2016). These are primarily based on a high diversity of food 
products, independent of season and local production, and on the

extension of the distances that food travels between production and 
consumption. The transition of traditional diets to more homogeneous 
diets has also become tied to consumption of animal protein, which 
has increased GHG emissions globally (Section 5.4.6). 
Cities are becoming key actors in developing strategies of mitigation 
to climate change, in their food procurement and in sustainable 
urban food policies alike (McPhearson et al. 2018). These are being 
developed by big and medium-sized cities in the world, often 
integrated within climate change policies (Moragues et al. 2013 and 
Calori and Magarini 2015). A review of 100 cities shows that urban 
food consumption is one of the largest sources of urban material 
flows, urban carbon footprint, and land footprint (Goldstein et al. 
2017). Additionally, the urban poor have limited capacity to adapt to 
climate-related impacts, which place their food security at risk under 
climate change (Dubbeling and de Zeeuw 2011).
Urban and peri-urban areas. In 2010, around 14% of the global 
population was nourished by food grown in urban and peri-urban 
areas (Kriewald et al. 2019). A review study on Sub-Saharan Africa 
shows that urban and peri-urban agriculture contributes to climate 
change adaptation and mitigation (Lwasa et al. 2014, 2015). Urban 
and peri-urban agriculture reduces the food carbon footprint by 
avoiding long distance food transport. These types of agriculture 
also limit GHG emissions by recycling organic waste and wastewater 
that would otherwise release methane from landfills and dumping 
sites (Lwasa et al. 2014). Urban and peri-urban agriculture also 
contribute in adapting to climate change, including extreme events, 
by reducing the urban heat island effect, increasing water infiltration 
and slowing down run-offs to prevent flooding, etc. (Lwasa et al. 
2014, 2015; Kumar et al. 2017a). For example, a scenario analysis 
shows that urban gardens reduce the surface temperature up to 
10°C in comparison to the temperature without vegetation (Tsilini 
et al. 2015). Urban agriculture can also improve biodiversity and 
strengthen associated ecosystem services (Lin et al. 2015). 
Urban and peri-urban agriculture is exposed to climate risks and 
urban growth that may undermine its long-term potential to address 
urban food security (Padgham et al. 2015). Therefore, there is a need 
to better understand the impact of urban sprawl on peri-urban 
agriculture; the contribution of urban and peri-urban agriculture 
to food self-sufficiency of cities; the risks posed by pollutants from 
urban areas to agriculture and vice-versa; the global and regional 
extent of urban agriculture; and the role that urban agriculture 
could play in climate resilience and abating malnutrition (Mok et al. 
2014; Hamilton et al. 2014). Globally, urban sprawl is projected to 
consume  1.8–2.4% and  5% of the current cultivated land by 
2030 and 2050 respectively, leading to crop calorie loss of 3–4% 
and  6–7%, respectively (Pradhan et al. 2014 and Bren  d’Amour 
et al. 2017). Kriewald et al. 2019 shows that the urban growth has 
the largest impact in many sub-continental regions (e.g., Western, 
Central, and Eastern Africa), while climate change will mostly reduce 
potential of urban and peri-urban agriculture in Southern Europe and 
North Africa.
In summary, urban and peri-urban agriculture can contribute to 
improving urban food security, reducing GHG emissions, and adapting 
to climate change impacts (robust evidence, medium agreement).
1.6.6 
Links to the Sustainable Development Goals 
In 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris 
Agreement were two global major international policies adopted 
by all countries to guide the world to overall sustainability, within 
the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and UNFCCC processes 
respectively. The 2030 Sustainable Development agenda includes 
17  goals and 169 targets, including zero hunger, sustainable 
agriculture and climate action (United Nations 2015).
This section focuses on intra – and inter-linkages of SDG 2  and 
SDG 13 based on the official SDG indicators (Figure 5.16), showing 
the current conditions (Roy et al. (2018) and Chapter 7 for further 
discussion). The second goal (Zero Hunger  – SDG  2) aims to end 
hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030 and commits to 
universal access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food at all times of 
the year. SDG 13 (Climate Action) calls for urgent action to combat 
climate change and its impacts. Integrating the SDGs into the global 
food system can provide opportunities for mitigation and adaptation 
and enhancement of food security.
Ensuring food security (SDG 2) shows positive relations (synergies) 
with most goals, according to Pradhan et al. (2017) and the 
International Council for Science (ICSU) (2017), but has trade-offs 
with SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG 15 
(Life on Land) under current development paradigms (Pradhan 
et al. 2017). Sustainable transformation of traditional consumption 
and production approaches can overcome these trade-offs based 
on several innovative methods (Shove et al. 2012). For example, 
sustainable intensification and reduction of food waste can minimise 
the observed negative relations between SDG 2  and other goals 
(Obersteiner et al. 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box  6 in Chapter 5  and 
Section 5.5.2). Achieving target 12.3 of SDG 12 ‘by 2030, to halve 
per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and 
reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including 
post-harvest losses’ will contribute to climate change mitigation.
Doubling productivity of smallholder farmers and halving food loss 
and waste by 2030 are targets of SDG 2 and SDG 12, respectively 
(United Nations Statistics Division 2016). Agroforestry that promotes 
biodiversity and sustainable land management also contributes to 
food security (Montagnini and Metzel 2017). Land restoration and 
protection (SDG 15) can increase crop productivity (SDG 2) (Wolff 
et al. 2018). Similarly, efficient irrigation practices can reduce 
water demand for agriculture that could improve the health of the 
freshwater ecosystem (SDG 6 and SDG 15) without reducing food 
production (Jägermeyr et al. 2017). 
Climate action (SDG 13) shows negative relations (trade-offs) with 
most goals and is antagonistic to the 2030 development agenda 
under the current development paradigm (Figure  5.16) (Lusseau 
and Mancini 2019 and Pradhan 2019). The targets for SDG 13 have 
511
Food security 
Chapter 5

a strong focus on climate change adaptation, and the data for the 
SDG 13 indicators are limited. SDG 13 shares two indicators with 
SDG 1 and SDG 11 (United Nations 2017) and therefore, has mainly 
positive linkages with these two goals. Trade-offs were observed 
between SDG 2 and SDG 13 for around 50% of the linkages analysed 
(Pradhan et al. 2017). 
Transformation from current development paradigms and the 
breaking of these lock-in effects can protect climate and achieve food 
security in future. Sustainable agriculture practices can provide climate 
change adaptation and mitigation synergies, linking SDG 2  and 
SDG 13 more positively, according to the International Council for 
Science (ICSU) (2017). IPCC found that most of the current observed 
trade-offs between SDG 13 and other SDGs can be converted into 
synergies based on various mitigation options that can be deployed 
to limit the global warming well below 1.5°C (IPCC 2018b). 
In summary, there are fundamental synergies that can facilitate 
the joint implementation of strategies to achieve SDGs and climate 
action, with particular reference to those climate response strategies 
related to both supply side (production and supply chains) and 
demand side (consumption and dietary choices) described in this 
chapter (high agreement and medium evidence).
1.7 
Enabling conditions and knowledge gaps 
To achieve mitigation and adaptation to climate change in food 
systems, enabling conditions are needed to scale up the adoption of 
effective strategies (such as those described in Sections 5.3 to 5.6 and 
Chapter 6). These enabling conditions include multi-level governance 
and multi-sector institutions (Supplementary Material Section 
SM5.5) and multiple policy pathways (Sections 5.7.1 and 5.7.2). In 
this regard, the subnational level is gaining relevance both in food 
systems and climate change. Just Transitions are needed to address 
both climate change and food security (Section 5.7.3). Mobilisation of 
knowledge, education, and capacity will be required (Section 5.7.4) 
to fill knowledge gaps (Section 5.7.5). 
Effective governance of food systems and climate change requires 
the establishment of institutions responsible for coordinating among 
multiple sectors (education, agriculture, environment, welfare, 
consumption, economic, health), levels (local, regional, national, 
global) and actors (governments, CSO, public sector, private sector, 
international bodies). Positive outcomes will be engendered by 
participation, learning, flexibility, and cooperation. See Supplementary 
Material SM5.5 for further discussion. 
1.7.1 
Enabling policy environments
The scope for responses to make sustainable land use inclusive 
of climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the policies to 
implement them, are covered in detail in Chapters 6 and 7. Here 
we highlight some of the major policy areas that have shaped 
the food system, and might be able to shape responses in future. 
Although two families of policy – agriculture and trade – have been 
instrumental in shaping the food system in the past (and potentially 
have led to conditions that increase climate vulnerability) (Benton 
and Bailey 2019), a much wider family of policy instruments can be 
deployed to reconfigure the food system to deliver healthy diets in 
a sustainable way.
1.7.1.1 
Agriculture and trade policy
Agriculture. The thrust of agricultural policies over the last 50 years has 
been to increase productivity, even if at the expense of environmental 
sustainability (Benton and Bailey 2019). For example, in 2007–2009, 
46% of OECD support for agriculture was based on measures of output 
(price support or payments based on yields), 37% of support was 
based on the current or historical area planted, herd size (or correlated 
measures of the notional costs of farming), and 13% was payments 
linked to input prices. In a  similar vein, non-OECD countries have 
promoted productivity growth for their agricultural sectors. 
Trade. Along with agricultural policy to grow productivity, the 
development of frameworks to liberalise trade (such as the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  – GATT  – Uruguay Round, now 
incorporated into the World Trade Organization) have been essential 
in stimulating the growth of a  globalised food system. Almost 
every country has a reliance on trade to fulfil some or all of its local 
food needs, and trade networks have grown to be highly complex 
(Puma et al. 2015; MacDonald et al. 2015; Fader et al. 2013 and 
Ercsey-Ravasz et al. 2012). This is because many countries lack the 
capacity to produce sufficient food due to climatic conditions, soil 
quality, water constraints, and availability of farmland (FAO 2015b). In 
a world of liberalised trade, using comparative advantage to maximise 
production in high-yielding commodities, exporting excess production, 
and importing supplies of other goods supports economic growth. 
City states as well as many small island states, do not have adequate 
farmland to feed their populations, while Sub-Saharan African 
countries are projected to experience high population growth 
as well as to be negatively impacted by climate change, and thus 
will likely find it difficult to produce all of their own food supplies 
(Agarwal et al. 2002). One study estimates that some 66 countries 
are currently incapable of being self-sufficient in food (Pradhan et al. 
2014). Estimates of the proportion of people relying on trade for 
basic food security vary from about 16% to about 22% (Fader et al. 
2013; Pradhan et al. 2014), with this figure rising to between 1.5 and 
6 billion people by 2050, depending on dietary shifts, agricultural 
gains, and climate impacts (Pradhan et al. 2014). 
Global trade is therefore essential for achieving food and nutrition 
security under climate change because it provides a mechanism for 
enhancing the efficiency of supply chains, reducing the vulnerability of 
512

food availability to changes in local weather, and moving production 
from areas of surplus to areas of deficit (FAO 2018d). However, the 
benefits of trade will only be realised if trade is managed in ways that 
maximise broadened access to new markets while minimising the 
risks of increased exposure to international competition and market 
volatility (Challinor et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2017b). 
As described in Section 5.8.1, trade acts to buffer exposure to climate 
risks when the market works well. Under certain conditions – such 
as shocks, or the perception of a shock, coupled with a lack of food 
stocks or lack of transparency about stocks (Challinor et al. 2018; 
Marchand et al. 2016) – the market can fail and trade can expose 
countries to food price shocks. 
Furthermore, Clapp (2016) showed that trade, often supported by 
high levels of subsidy support to agriculture in some countries, 
can depress world prices and reduce incomes for other agricultural 
exporters. Lower food prices that result from subsidy support may 
benefit urban consumers in importing countries, but at the same 
time they may hurt farmers’ incomes in those same countries. The 
outmigration of smallholder farmers from the agriculture sector 
across the Global South is significantly attributed to these trade 
patterns of cheap food imports (Wittman 2011; McMichael 2014; 
Akram-Lodhi et al. 2013). Food production and trade cartels, as well 
as financial speculation on food futures markets, affect low-income 
market-dependent populations. 
Food sovereignty is a framing developed to conceptualise these issues 
(Reuter 2015). They directly relate to the ability of local communities 
and nations to build their food systems, based, among other aspects, 
on diversified crops and ILK. If a country enters international markets 
by growing more commodity crops and reducing local crop varieties, 
it may get economic benefits, but may also expose itself to climate 
risks and food insecurity by increasing reliance on trade, which may 
be increasingly disrupted by climate risks. These include a local lack 
of resilience from reduced diversity of products, but also exposure to 
food price spikes, which can become amplified by market mechanisms 
such as speculation.
In summary, countries must determine the balance between locally 
produced versus imported food (and feed) such that it both minimises 
climate risks and ensures sustainable food security. There is medium 
evidence that trade has positive benefits but also creates exposure 
to risks (Section 5.3). 
1.7.1.2 
Scope for expanded policies 
There are a range of ways that policy can intervene to stimulate change 
in the food system – through agriculture, research and development, 
food standards, manufacture and storage, changing the food 
environment and access to food, changing practices to encourage 
or discourage trade (Table 5.6). Novel incentives can stimulate the 
market, for example, through reduction in waste or changes in diets 
to gain benefits from a health or sustainability direction. Different 
contexts with different needs will require different set of policies 
at local, regional and national levels. See Supplementary Material 
Section SM5.5 for further discussion on expanded policies.
In summary, although agriculture is often thought to be shaped 
predominantly by agriculture and trade policies, there are over twenty 
families of policy areas that can shape agricultural production directly 
or indirectly (through environmental regulations or through markets, 
including by shaping consumer behaviour). Thus, delivering outcomes 
promoting climate change adaptation and mitigation can arise from 
policies across many departments, if suitably designed and aligned.
1.7.1.3 
Health-related policies and cost savings
The co-benefits arising from mitigating climate change through 
changing dietary patterns, and thus demand, have potentially 
important economic impacts (high confidence). The gross 
value added from agriculture to the global economy (GVA) 
was  1.9  trillion  USD2013 (FAO 2015c), from a  global agriculture 
economy (GDP) of 2.7 trillion USD2016. In 2013, the FAO estimated 
an annual cost of 3.5 trillion USD for malnutrition (FAO 2013a). 
However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the economic health 
costs of current food systems for several reasons: (i) lack of data – 
for example there is little robust data in the UK on the prevalence 
of malnutrition in the general population (beyond estimates of 
obesity and surveys of malnourishment of patients in hospital and 
care homes, from which estimates over 3 million people in the UK 
are undernourished (BAPEN 2012); (ii) lack of robust methodology 
to determine, for example, the exact relationship between 
over-consumption of poor diets, obesity and non-communicable 
diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, a range of cancers or 
Alzheimer’s disease (Pedditizi et al. 2016), and (iii) unequal healthcare 
spending around the world. 
In the USA, the economic cost of diabetes, a  disease strongly 
associated with obesity and affecting about 23 million Americans, 
is estimated at 327 billion USD2017 (American Diabetes Association 
2018), with direct healthcare costs of 9600  USD per person. By 
2025, it is estimated that, globally, there will be over 700 million 
people with diabetes (NCD-RisC 2016b), over 30 times the number 
in the USA. Even if a global average cost of diabetes per capita were 
a quarter of that in the USA, the total economic cost of diabetes 
would be approximately the same as global agricultural GDP. Finally, 
(iv) the role of agriculture in causing ill-health beyond dietary health, 
such as through degrading air quality (e.g., Paulot and Jacob 2014). 
Whilst data of the healthcare costs associated with the food system 
and diets are scattered and the proportion of costs directly attributable 
to diets and food consumption is uncertain, there is potential for more 
preventative healthcare systems to save significant costs that could 
incentivise agricultural business models to change what is grown, and 
how. The potential of moving towards more preventative healthcare 
is widely discussed in health economics literature, particularly in 
order to reduce the life-style-related (including dietary-related) 
disease component in aging populations (e.g., Bloom et al. 2015).

1.7.1.4 
Multiple policy pathways
As discussed in more detail in Chapters 6 and 7, there is a wide 
potential suite of interventions and policies that can potentially 
enhance the adaptation of food systems to climate change, as well as 
enhance the mitigation potential of food systems on climate change. 
There is an increasing number of studies that argue that the key to 
sustainable land management is not in land management practices 
but in the factors that determine the demand for products from land 
(such as food). Public health policy, therefore, has the potential to 
affect dietary choice and thus the demand for different amounts of, 
and types of, food. 
Obersteiner et al. (2016) show that increasing the average price of 
food is an important policy lever that, by reducing demand, reduces 
food waste, pressure on land and water, impacts on biodiversity and 
through reducing emissions, mitigates climate change and potentially 
helps to achieve multiple SDGs. Whilst such policy responses – such 
as a carbon tax applied to goods including food – has the potential 
to be regressive, affecting the poor differentially (Frank et al. 2017; 
Hasegawa et al. 2018 and Kehlbacher et al. 2016), and increasing 
food insecurity – further development of social safety nets can help 
to avoid the regressive nature (Hasegawa et al. 2018). Hasegawa 
et al. (2018) point out that such safety nets for vulnerable populations 
could be funded from the revenues arising from a carbon tax.
The evidence suggests, as with SR15 (IPCC 2018a) and its multiple 
pathways to climate change solutions, that there is no single solution 
that will address the problems of food and climate change, but 
instead there is a  need to deploy many solutions, simultaneously 
adapted to the needs and options available in a given context. For 
example, Springmann et al. (2018a) indicate that maintaining the 
food system within planetary boundaries at mid-century, including 
equitable climate, requires increasing the production (and resilience) 
of agricultural outputs (i.e.,  closing yield gaps), reducing waste, 
and changes in diets towards ones often described as flexitarian 
(low-meat dietary patterns that are in line with available evidence 
on healthy eating). Such changes can have significant co-benefits 
for public health, as well as facing significant challenges to ensure 
equity (in terms of affordability for those in poverty). 
Significant changes in the food system require them to be acceptable 
to the public (‘public license’), or they will be rejected. Focus groups 
with members of the public around the world, on the issue of changing 
diets, have shown that there is a general belief that the government 
plays a key role in leading efforts for change in consumption patterns 
(Wellesley et al. 2015). If governments are not leading on an issue, or 
indicating the need for it through leading public dialogue, it signals to 
their citizens that the issue is unimportant or undeserving of concern. 
In summary, there is significant potential (high confidence) that, 
through aligning multiple policy goals, multiple benefits can 
be realised that positively impact public health, mitigation and 
adaptation (e.g.,  adoption of healthier diets, reduction in waste, 
reduction in environmental impact). These benefits may not occur 
without the alignment across multiple policy areas (high confidence).
1.7.2 
Enablers for changing markets and trade
‘Demand’ for food is not an exogenous variable to the food system 
but is shaped crucially by its ability to produce, market, and supply 
food of different types and prices. These market dynamics can be 
influenced by a  variety of factors beyond consumer preferences 
(e.g.,  corporate power and marketing, transparency, the food 
environment more generally), and the ability to reshape the market 
can also depend on its internal resilience and/or external shocks 
(Challinor et al. 2018; Oliver et al. 2018). 
1.7.2.1 
Capital markets
Two areas are often discussed regarding the role of capital 
markets in shaping the food system. First, investment in disruptive 
technologies might stimulate climate-smart food systems (WEF/
McKinsey &  Company 2018 and Bailey and Wellesley 2017), 
including alternative proteins, such as laboratory or ‘clean meat’ 
(which has significant ability to impact on land-use requirements) 
(Alexander et al. 2017) (Section 5.5.1.6). An innovation environment 
through which disruptive technology can emerge typically requires 
the support of public policy, whether in directly financing small and 
emerging enterprises, or funding research and development via 
reducing tax burdens. 
Second, widespread adoption of (and perhaps underpinned by 
regulation for) natural capital accounting as well as financial 
accounting are needed. Investors can then be aware of the risk 
exposure of institutions, which can undermine sustainability through 
externalising costs onto the environment. The prime example of this 
in the realm of climate change is the Carbon Disclosure Project, with 
around 2500 companies voluntarily disclosing their carbon footprint, 
representing nearly 60% of the world’s market capital (CDP 2018).
1.7.2.2 
Insurance and re-insurance
The insurance industry can incentivise actors’ behaviour towards 
greater climate mitigation or adaptation, including building 
resilience. For example, Lloyd’s of London analysed the implications 
of extreme weather for the insurance market, and conclude that the 
insurance industry needs to examine their exposure to risks through 
the food supply chain and develop innovative risk-sharing products 
that can make an important contribution to resilience of the global 
food system (Lloyd’s 2015). 
Many of these potential areas for enabling healthy and sustainable 
food systems are also knowledge gaps, in that, whilst the levers are 
widely known, their efficacy and the ability to scale-up, in any given 
context, are poorly understood.

1.7.3 
Just Transitions to sustainability
Research is limited on how land-use transitions would proceed from 
ruminant production to other socio-ecological farming systems. 
Ruminants have been associated with humans since the early 
development of agriculture, and the role of ruminants in many 
agricultural systems and smallholder communities is substantial. 
Ruminant production systems have been adapted to a wide range 
of socioeconomic and environmental conditions in crop, forestry, 
and food processing settings  (Čolović et al. 2019), bioenergy 
production  (de Souza et al. 2019), and food waste recycling 
(Westendorf 2000). Pasture cultivation in succession to crops is 
recognised as important to management of pest and diseases cycles 
and to improve soil carbon stocks and soil quality  (Carvalho and 
Dedieu 2014). Grazing livestock is important as a reserve of food and 
economic stocks for some smallholders (Ouma et al. 2003).
Possible land-use options for  transitions  away from livestock 
production in a range of systems include (a) retain land but reduce 
investments to run a more extensive production system; (b) change 
land use by adopting a different production activity; (c) abandon land 
(or part of the farm) to allow secondary vegetation regrowth (Carvalho 
et al. 2019 and Laue and Arima 2016); and (d) invest in afforestation 
or reforestation  (Baynes et al. 2017). The extensification option 
could lead to increases rather than decreases in GHG emissions 
related to reduction in beef consumption. Large-scale abandonment, 
afforestation, or reforestation would probably have more positive 
environmental outcomes, but could result in economic and social 
issues that would require governmental subsidies to avoid decline 
and migration in some regions (Henderson et al. 2018). 
Alternative economic use of land, such as bioenergy production, 
could balance the negative socioeconomic impact of reducing beef 
output, reduce the tax values needed to reduce consumption, and 
avoid extensification of ruminant production systems  (Wirsenius 
et al. 2011). However, the analysis of the transition of land use for 
ruminants to other agricultural production systems is still a literature 
gap (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6). 
Finally, it is important to recognise that, while energy alternatives 
produce the same function for the consumer, it is questionable that 
providing the same nutritional value through an optimised mix of 
dietary ingredients provides the same utility for humans. Food has 
a central role in human pleasure, socialisation, cultural identity, and 
health (Röös et al. 2017), including some of the most vulnerable 
groups, so  Just Transitions  and their costs need to be taken into 
account. Pilot projects are important to provide greater insights for 
large-scale policy design, implementation, and enforcement.
In summary, more research is needed on how land-use transitions would 
proceed from ruminant production to other farming systems and 
affect the farmers and other food system actors involved. There 
is limited evidence on what the decisions of farmers under lower 
beef demand would be.
1.7.4 
Mobilising knowledge
Addressing climate change-related challenges and ensuring food 
security requires all types of knowledge (formal/non-formal, scientific/
indigenous, women, youth, technological). Miles et al. (2017) 
stated that a research and policy feedback that allows transitions 
to sustainable food systems must take a whole system approach. 
Currently, in transmitting knowledge for food security and land 
sustainability under climate change there are three major approaches: 
(i) public technology transfer with demonstration (extension agents); 
(ii) public and private advisory services (for intensification techniques) 
and; (iii) non-formal education with many different variants such as 
farmer field schools, rural resource centres; facilitation extension 
where front-line agents primarily work as ‘knowledge brokers’ in 
facilitating the teaching-learning process among all types of farmers 
(including women and rural young people), or farmer-to-farmer, 
where farmers act themselves as knowledge transfer and sharing 
actors through peer processes.
1.7.4.1 
Indigenous and local knowledge
Recent discourse has a strong orientation towards scaling-up innovation 
and adoption by local farmers. However, autonomous adaptation, 
indigenous knowledge and local knowledge are both important for 
agricultural adaptation (Biggs et al. 2013) (Section 5.3). These involve the 
promotion of farmer participation in governance structures, research, 
and the design of systems for the generation and dissemination of 
knowledge and technology, so that farmers’ needs and knowledge can 
be taken into consideration. Klenk et al. (2017) found that mobilisation 
of local knowledge can inform adaptation decision-making and may 
facilitate greater flexibility in government-funded research. As an 
example, rural innovation in terrace agriculture developed on the 
basis of a local coping mechanism and adopted by peasant farmers 
in Latin America may serve as an adaptation option or starting place 
for learning about climate change responses (Bocco and Napoletano 
2017). Clemens et al. (2015) found that an open dialogue platform 
enabled horizontal exchange of ideas and alliances for social learning 
and knowledge-sharing in Vietnam. Improving local technologies in 
a participatory manner, through on-farm experimentation, farmer-to-
farmer exchange, consideration of women and youths, is also relevant 
in mobilising knowledge and technologies. 
1.7.4.2 
Citizen science
Citizen science has been tested as a useful tool with potential for 
biodiversity conservation (Schmitz et al. 2015) and mobilising 
knowledge from society. In food systems, knowledge-holders 
(e.g.,  farmers and pastoralists) are trained to gather scientific 
data in order to promote conservation and resource management 
(Fulton et al. 2019) or to conserve and use traditional knowledge 
in developed countries relevant to climate change adaptation and 
mitigation through the use of ICT (Calvet-Mir et al. 2018).
515
Food security 
Chapter 5
5
1.7.4.3 
Capacity building and education
Mobilising knowledge may also require significant efforts on capacity 
building and education to scale up food system responses to climate 
change. This may involve increasing the capacity of farmers to manage 
current climate risks and to mitigate and adapt in their local contexts, 
and of citizens and consumers to understand the links between food 
demand and climate change emissions and impacts, as well as policy 
makers to take a systemic view of the issues. Capacity building may 
also require institutional change. For example, alignment of policies 
towards sustainable and healthy food systems may require building 
institutional capacity across policy silos. 
As a tool for societal transformation, education is a powerful strategy 
to accelerate changes in the way we produce and consume food. 
Education refers to early learning and lifelong acquisition of skills 
for higher awareness and actions for solving food system challenges 
(FAO 2005). Education also entails vocational training, research 
and institutional strengthening (Hollinger 2015). Educational focus 
changes according to the supply side (e.g.,  crop selection, input 
resource management, yield improvement, and diversification) and the 
demand since (nutrition and dietary health implications). Education on 
food loss and waste spans both the supply and demand sides.
In developing countries, extension learning such as farmer field 
schools  – also known asrural resources centers  – are established 
to promote experiential learning on improved production and food 
transformation (FAO 2016c). In developed countries, education 
campaigns are being undertaken to reduce food waste, improve diets 
and redefine acceptable food (e.g., “less than perfect” fruits and 
vegetables), and ultimately can contribute to changes in the structure 
of food industries (Heller 2019; UNCCD 2017).
The design of new education modules from primary to secondary 
to tertiary education could help create new jobs in the realm of 
sustainability (e.g.,  certification programmes). For example, one 
area could be educating managers of recycling programmes for 
food-efficient cities where food and organic waste are recycled 
to become fertilisers (Jara-Samaniego et al. 2017). Research and 
education need to be coordinated so that knowledge gaps can be 
filled and greater trust established in shifting behaviour of individuals 
to be more sustainable. Education campaigns can also influence 
policy and legislation, and help to advance successful outcomes for 
climate change mitigation and adaptation regarding supply-side 
innovations, technologies, trade, and investment, and demand-side 
evolution of food choices for health and sustainability, and greater 
gender equality throughout the entire food system (Heller 2019).

1.7.5 
Knowledge gaps and key research areas
Knowledge gaps around options and solutions and their (co-)benefits 
and trade-offs are increasingly important now that implementation 
of mitigation and adaptation measures is scaling up. 
Research is needed on how a changing climate and interventions 
to respond to it will affect all aspects of food security, including 
access, utilisation and stability, not just availability. Knowledge gaps 
across all the food security pillars are one of the barriers hindering 
mitigation and adaptation to climate change in the food system and 
its capacity to deliver food security. The key areas for climate change, 
food systems, and food security research are enlisted below.
1.7.5.1 
Impacts and adaptation 
Climate Services (food availability). Agriculture and food security 
is a priority area for the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) 
a programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The 
GFCS enables vulnerable sectors and populations to better manage 
climate variability and adapt to climate change (Hansen et al. 2018). 
Global precipitation datasets and remote sensing technologies can 
be used to detect local to regional anomalies in precipitation as a tool 
for devising early-warning systems for drought-related impacts, such 
as famine (Huntington et al. 2017). 
Crop and livestock genetics (food availability, utilisation). 
Advances in plant breeding are crucial for enhancing food security 
under changing climate for a wide variety of crops including fruits 
and vegetables as well as staples. Genetics improvement is needed 
in order to breed crops and livestock that can both reduce GHG 
emissions, increase drought and heat tolerance (e.g.,  rice), and 
enhance nutrition and food security (Nankishore and Farrell 2016; 
Kole et al. 2015). Many of these characteristics already exist in 
traditional varieties, including orphan crops and indigenous and 
local breeds, so research is needed to recuperate such varieties and 
evaluate their potential for adaptation and mitigation. 
Phenomics-assisted breeding appears to be a  promising tool for 
deciphering the stress responsiveness of crop and animal species 
(Papageorgiou 2017; Kole et al. 2015; Lopes et al. 2015; Boettcher et al. 
2015). Initially discovered in bacteria and archaea, CRISPR–Cas9 is 
an adaptive immune system found in prokaryotes and since 2013 has 
been used as a genome editing tool in plants. The main use of CRISPR 
systems is to achieve improved yield performance, biofortification, 
biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, with rice (Oryza sativa) being the 
most studied crop (Gao 2018 and Ricroch et al. 2017).
Climate impact models (food availability). Understanding 
the full range of climate impacts on staple crops (especially those 
important in developing countries, such as fruits and vegetables) 
is missing in the current climate impact models. Further, the CO2 
effects on nutrition quality of different crops are just beginning to 
be parameterised in the models (Müller et al. 2014). Bridging these 
gaps is essential for projecting future dietary diversity, healthy diets, 
and food security (Bisbis et al. 2018). Crop model improvements are 
needed for simulation of evapotranspiration to guide crop water 
management in future climate conditions (Cammarano et al. 2016). 
Similarly, mores studies are needed to understand the impacts of 
climate change on global rangelands, livestock and aquaculture, 
which have received comparatively less attention than the impacts 
on crop production.
Resilience to extreme events (food availability, access, 
utilisation, and stability). On the adaptation side, knowledge 
gaps include impacts of climate shocks (Rodríguez Osuna et al. 
2014) as opposed to impacts of slow-onset climate change, how 
climate-related harvest failures in one continent may influence food 
security outcomes in others, impacts of climate change on fruits and 
vegetables and their nutrient contents. 
1.7.5.2 
 Emissions and mitigation
GHG emissions inventory techniques (food utilisation). 
Knowledge gaps include food consumption-based emissions at 
national scales, embedded emissions (overseas footprints) of food 
systems, comparison of GHG emissions per type of food systems 
(e.g.,  smallholder and large-scale commercial food systems), 
and GHG emissions from land-based aquaculture. An additional 
knowledge gap is the need for more socio-economic assessments of 
the potential of various integrated practices to deliver the mitigation 
potential estimated from a biophysical perspective. This needs to be 
effectively monitored, verified, and implemented, once barriers and 
incentives to adoption of the techniques, practices, and technologies 
are considered. Thus, future research needs fill the gaps on evaluation 
of climate actions in the food system.
Food supply chains (food availability). The expansion of the 
cold chain into developing economies means increased energy 
consumption and GHG emissions at the consumer stages of the food 
system, but its net impact on GHG emissions for food systems as 
a whole, is complex and uncertain (Heard and Miller 2016). Further 
understanding of negative side effects in intensive food processing 
systems is still needed. 
Blockchains, as a distributed digital ledger technology which ensures 
transparency, traceability, and security, is showing promise for easing 
some global food supply chain management challenges, including the 
need for documentation of sustainability and the circular economy for 
stakeholders including governments, communities, and consumers 
to meet sustainability goals. Blockchain-led transformation of 
food supply chains is still in its early stages; research is needed on 
overcoming barriers to adoption (Tripoli and Schmidhuber 2018; 
Casado-Vara et al. 2018; Mao et al. 2018; Saberi et al. 2019).
1.7.5.3 
Synergies and trade-offs
Supply-side and demand-side mitigation and adaptation (food 
availability, utilisation). Knowledge gaps exist in characterising 
the potential and risks associated with novel mitigation technologies 
on the supply side (e.g.,  inhibitors, targeted breeding, cellular 
agriculture, etc.). Additionally, most integrated assessment models

Box 5.6 |  Migration in the Pacific region: Impacts of climate change on food security
Climate change-induced displacement and migration in the Pacific has received wide attention in the scientific discourse (Fröhlich and 
Klepp 2019). The processes of climate change and their effects in the region have serious implications for Pacific Island nations as 
they influence the environments that are their ‘life-support systems’ (Campbell 2014). Climate variability poses significant threats to 
both agricultural production and food security. Rising temperatures and reductions in groundwater availability, as well as increasing 
frequency and severity of disaster events translate into substantial impacts on food security, causing human displacement, a trend 
that will be aggravated by future climate impacts (ADB 2017). Declining soil productivity, groundwater depletion, and non-availability 
of freshwater threatens agricultural production in many remote atolls. 
Many countries in the Pacific devote a large share of available land area to agricultural production. For example, more than 60% of land 
area is cultivated in the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu and more than 40% in Kiribati and Tonga. With few options to expand agricultural 
area, the projected impacts of climate change on food production are of particular concern (ADB 2013, 2017). The degradation of 
available land area for traditional agriculture, adverse disruptions of agricultural productivity and diminishing livelihood opportunities 
through climate change impacts leads to increasing poverty and food insecurity, incentivising migration to urban agglomerations 
(ADB 2017; FAO et al. 2018). 
Campbell (2014) describe the trends that lead to migration. First, climate change, including rising sea levels, affects communities’ land 
security, which is the physical presence on which to live and sustain livelihoods. Second, they impinge on livelihood security (especially 
food security) of island communities where the productivity of both subsistence and commercial food production systems is reduced. 
Third, the effects of climate change are especially severe on small-island environments since they result in declining ecological habitat. 
The effects on island systems are mostly manifested in atolls through erosion and inundation, and on human populations through 
migration. Population growth and scenarios of climate change are likely to further induce food stress as impacts unfold in the coming 
decades (Campbell 2015). 
While the populations of several islands and island groups in the Pacific (e.g., Tuvalu, Carteret Islands, and Kiribati) have been 
perceived as the first probable victims of rising seas so that their inhabitants would become, and in some quarters already are seen 
to be, the first ‘environmental’ or ‘climate change refugees’, migration patterns vary. Especially in small islands, the range and nature 
of the interactions among economic, social, and/or political drivers are complex. For example, in the Maldives, Stojanov et al. (2017) 
show that while collective perceptions support climate change impacts as being one of the key factors prompting migration, individual 
perceptions give more credence to other cultural, religious, economic or social factors. 
In the Pacific, Tuvalu has long been a prime candidate to disappear due to rising sea levels, forcing human migration. However, results 
of a recent study (Kench et al. 2018) challenge perceptions of island loss in Tuvalu, reporting that there is a net increase in land area 
of 73.5 ha. The findings suggest that islands are dynamic features likely to persist as habitation sites over the next century, presenting 
opportunities for adaptation that embrace the heterogeneity of island types and processes. Farbotko (2010) and Farbotko and Lazrus 
(2012) present Tuvalu as a site of ‘wishful sinking’, in the climate change discourse. These authors argue that representations of Tuvalu 
as a laboratory for global climate change migration are visualisations by non-locals. 
In Nanumea (Tuvalu), forced displacements and voluntary migrations are complex decisions made by individuals, families and communities 
in response to discourses on risk, deteriorating infrastructure and other economic and social pressures (Marino and Lazrus 2015). 
In many atoll nations in the Western Pacific, migration has increasingly become a sustainable livelihood strategy, irrespective of 
climate change (Connell 2015). 
In Lamen Bay, Vanuatu, migration is both a cause and consequence of local vulnerabilities. While migration provides an opportunity for 
households to meet their immediate economic needs, it limits the ability of the community to foster longer-term economic development. 
At the same time, migration adversely affects the ability of the community to maintain food security due to lost labour and changing 
attitudes towards traditional ways of life among community members (Craven 2015).

(IAMs) currently have limited regional data on BECCS projects 
because of little BECCS implementation (Lenzi et al. 2018). Hence, 
several BECCS scenarios rely on assumptions regarding regional 
climate, soils and infrastructure suitability (Köberle et al. 2019) as 
well as international trade (Lamers et al. 2011). 
Areas for study include how to incentivise, regulate, and raise 
awareness of the co-benefits of healthy consumption patterns 
and climate change mitigation and adaptation; to improve access 
to healthy diets for vulnerable groups through food assistance 
programmes; and to implement policies and campaigns to reduce 
food loss and food waste. Knowledge gaps also exist on the role of 
different policies, and underlying uncertainties, to promote changes 
in food habits towards climate resilience and healthy diets. 
Food systems, land-use change, and telecoupling (food 
availability, access, utilisation). The analytical framework of 
telecoupling has recently been proposed to address this complexity, 
particularly the connections, flows, and feedbacks characterising 
food systems (Friis et al. 2016; Easter et al. 2018). For example, how 
will climate-induced shifts in livestock and crop diseases affect food 
production and consumption in the future. Investigating the social 
and ecological consequences of these changes will contribute to 
decision-making under uncertainty in the future. Research areas include 
food systems and their boundaries, hierarchies, and scales through 
metabolism studies, political ecology and cultural anthropology.
Food-Energy-Water Nexus (food availability, utilisation, 
stability). Emerging interdisciplinary science efforts are providing 
new understanding of the interdependence of food, energy,  and 
water systems. These interdependencies are beginning to take into 
account climate change, food security, and AFOLU assessments 
(Scanlon et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2017). These science advances, in 
turn, provide critical information for coordinated management to 
improve the affordability, reliability, and environmental sustainability 
of food, energy,  and water systems. Despite significant advances 
within the past decade, there are still many challenges for the 
scientific community. These include the need for interdisciplinary 
science related to the food-energy-water nexus; ground-based 
monitoring and modelling at local-to-regional scales (Van Gaelen 
et al. 2017); incorporating human and institutional behaviour in 
models; partnerships among universities, industry, and government 
to develop policy-relevant data; and systems modelling to evaluate 
trade-offs associated with food-energy-water decisions (Scanlon 
et al. 2017). 
However, the nexus approach, as a conceptual framework, requires 
the recognition that, although land and the goods and services it 
provides is finite, potential demand for the goods and services may 
be greater than the ability to supply them sustainably (Benton et al. 
2018). By addressing demand-side issues, as well as supply-side 
efficiencies, it provides a potential route for minimising trade-offs for 
different goods and services (Benton et al. 2018) (Section 5.6).
1.8 
Future challenges to food security
A particular concern in regard to the future of food security is the 
potential for the impacts of increasing climate extremes on food 
production to contribute to multi-factored complex events such as 
food price spikes. In this section, we assess literature on food price 
spikes and potential strategies for increasing resilience to such 
occurrences. We then assess the potential for such food system 
events to affect migration and conflict.
1.8.1 
Food price spikes 
Under average conditions, global food system markets may function 
well, and equilibrium approaches can estimate demand and supply 
with some confidence; however, if there is a significant shock, the 
market can fail to smoothly link demand and supply through price, 
and a range of factors can act to amplify the effects of the shock, 
and transmit it across the world (Box 5.5). Given the potential for 
shocks driven by changing patterns of extreme weather to increase 
with climate change, there is the potential for market volatility to 
disrupt food supply through creating food price spikes. This potential 
is exacerbated by the interconnectedness of the food system (Puma 
et al. 2015) with other sectors (i.e., the food system depends on water, 
energy, and transport) (Homer-Dixon et al. 2015), so the impact of 
shocks can propagate across sectors and geographies (Homer-Dixon 
et al. 2015). There is also less spare land globally than there has been 
in the past, such that if prices spike, there are fewer options to bring 
new production on stream (Marianela et al. 2016).
Increasing extreme weather events can disrupt production and 
transport logistics. For example, in 2012 the USA Corn Belt suffered 
a  widespread drought; USA corn yield declined 16% compared 
to 2011 and 25% compared to 2009. In 2016, a record yield loss 
in France that is attributed to a conjunction of abnormal warmness in 
late autumn and abnormal wet in the following spring (Ben-Ari et al. 
2018) is another well-documented example. To the extent that such 
supply shocks are associated with climate change, they may become 
more frequent and contribute to greater instability in agricultural 
markets in the future. 
Furthermore, analogue conditions of past extremes might create 
significantly greater impacts in a warmer world. A study simulating 
analogous conditions to the Dust Bowl drought in today’s 
agriculture suggests that Dust Bowl-type droughts today would have 
unprecedented consequences, with yield losses about 50% larger 
than the severe drought of 2012 (Glotter and Elliott 2016). Damages 
at these extremes are highly sensitive to temperature, worsening by 
about 25% with each degree centigrade of warming. By mid-century, 
over 80% of summers are projected to have average temperatures 
that are likely to exceed the hottest summer in the Dust Bowl years 
(1936) (Glotter and Elliott 2016).

How a shortfall in production – or an interruption in trade due to an event affecting a logistics choke-point (Wellesley et al. 2017) – 
of any given magnitude may create impacts depends on many interacting factors (Homer-Dixon et al. 2015; Tadasse et al. 2016; 
Challinor et al. 2018). The principal route is by affecting agricultural commodity markets, which respond to a perturbation through 
multiple routes as in Figure 5.17. This includes pressures from other sectors (such as, if biofuels policy is incentivising crops for 
the production of ethanol, as happened in 2007–2008). The market response can be amplified by poor policies, setting up trade 
and non-trade barriers to exports, from countries seeking to ensure their local food security (Bailey et al. 2015). Furthermore, the 
perception of problems can fuel panic buying on the markets that in turn drives up prices. 
Thus, the impact of an extreme weather event on markets has both a trigger component (the event) and a risk perception component 
(Challinor et al. 2016, 2018). Through commodity markets, prices change across the world because almost every country depends, to 
a greater or lesser extent, on trade to fulfil local needs. Commodity prices can also affect local market prices by altering input prices, 
changing the cost of food aid, and through spill-over effects. For example, in 2007–2008 the grain affected by extreme weather was 
wheat, but there was a significant price spike in rice markets (Dawe 2010). 
520

As discussed by Bailey et al. (2015), there are a range of adaptation 
measures that can be put in place to reduce the impact of climate-related 
production shortfalls. These include (i) ensuring transparency of public 
and private stocks, as well as improved seasonal forecasting to signal 
forthcoming yield shortfalls (FAO 2016a; Ceglar et al. 2018; Iizumi et al. 
2018), (ii) building real or virtual stockholdings, (iii) increasing local 
productivity and diversity (as a  hedge against a  reliance on trade) 
and (iv) ensuring smoother market responses, through, for example, 
avoiding the imposition of export bans.
In summary, given the likelihood that extreme weather will increase, 
in both frequency and magnitude (Hansen et al. 2012; Coumou et al. 
2014; Mann et al. 2017; Bailey et al. 2015), and the current state of 
global and cross-sectoral interconnectedness, the food system is at 
increasing risk of disruption (medium evidence, medium agreement), 
with large uncertainty about how this could manifest. There is, 
therefore, a need to build resilience into international trade as well 
as local supplies.

Box 5.5 |  Market drivers and the consequences of extreme weather in 2010–2011 
The 2010–2011 food price spike was initially triggered by 
the exceptional heat in summer 2010, with an extent from 
Europe to the Ukraine and Western Russia (Barriopedro et al. 
2011; Watanabe et al. 2013; Hoag 2014). The heatwave in 
Russia was extreme in both temperature (over 40°C) and 
duration (from July to mid-August in 2010). This reduced 
wheat yields by approximately one third (Wegren 2011; 
Marchand et al. 2016). Simultaneously, in the Indus Valley in 
Pakistan, unprecedented rainfall led to flooding, affecting the 
lives and livelihoods of 20 million people. There is evidence 
that these effects were both linked and made more likely 
through climate change (Mann et al. 2017).
In response to its shortfall in yields, Russia imposed an export 
ban in order to maintain local food supplies. Other countries 
responded in a  largely uncoordinated ways, each of them 
driven by internal politics as well as national self-interests 
(Jones and Hiller 2017). Overall, these measures led to rapid 
price rises on the global markets (Welton 2011), partly 
through panic buying, but also through financial speculation 
(Spratt 2013). 
Analysis of responses to higher food prices in the developing 
world showed that lower-income groups responded 
by taking on more employment, reducing food intake, 
limiting expenditures, spending savings (if available), and 
participating in demonstrations. People often identified their 
problems as stemming from collusion between powerful 
incumbent interests (e.g.,  of politicians and big business) 
and disregard for the poor (Hossain and Green 2011). This 
politicised social response helped spark food-related civil 
protest, including riots, across a range of countries in 2010–
2011 (Natalini et al. 2017). In Pakistan, food price rises were 
exacerbated by the economic impacts of the floods, which 
further contributed to food-related riots in 2010. 
Price spikes also impact on food security in the developed 
world. In the UK, global commodity price inflation influenced 
local food prices, increasing food-price inflation by about five 
times at the end of 2010. Comparing household purchases 
over the five-year period from 2007 to 2011 showed that 
the amount of food bought declined, on average, by 4.2%, 
whilst paying 12% more for it. The lowest income decile 
spent 17% more by 2011 than they did in 2007 (Holding et 
al. 2013; Tadasse et al. 2016). Consumers also saved money 
by trading down for cheaper alternatives. For the poorest, in 
the extreme situation, food became unaffordable: the Trussell 
Trust, a  charity supplying emergency food handouts for 
people in crisis, noted a 50% increase in handouts in 2010.
1.8.2 
Migration and conflict
Since the IPCC AR5 (Porter et al. 2014; Cramer et al. 2014), new 
work has advanced multi-factor methodological issues related to 
migration and conflict (e.g., Kelley et al. 2015, 2017; Werrell et al. 
2015; Challinor et al. 2018; Pasini et al. 2018). These in particular have 
addressed systemic risks to food security that result from cascading 
impacts triggered by droughts and floods and how these are related 
to a broad range of societal influences.
Climate variability and extremes have short-, medium – and long-term 
impacts on livelihoods and livelihood assets – especially of the poor – 
contributing to greater risk of food insecurity and malnutrition (FAO 
et al. 2018). Drought threatens local food security and nutrition and 
aggravates humanitarian conditions, which can trigger large-scale 
human displacement and create a  breeding ground for conflict 
(Maystadt and Ecker 2014). There is medium agreement that existing 
patterns of conflict could be reinforced under climate change, affecting 
food security and livelihood opportunities, for example, in already 
fragile regions with ethnic divides such as North and Central Africa as 
well as Central Asia (Buhaug 2016; Schleussner et al. 2016) (Box 5.6). 
Challinor et al. (2018) have developed a typology for transboundary 
and transboundary risk transmission that distinguishes the roles 
of climate and social and economic systems. To understand these 
complex interactions, they recommend a  combination of methods 
that include expert judgement; interactive scenario building; global 
systems science and big data; and innovative use of climate and 
integrated assessment models; and social science techniques 
(e.g., surveys, interviews, and focus groups). 
1.8.2.1 
Migration
There has been a  surge in international migration in recent years, 
with around five million people migrating permanently in 2016 
(OECD 2017). Though the initial driver of migration may differ across 
populations, countries and contexts, migrants tend to seek the same 
fundamental objective: to provide security and adequate living 
conditions for their families and themselves. Food insecurity is a critical 
‘push’ factor driving international migration, along with conflict, 
income inequality, and population growth. The act of migration itself 
causes food insecurity, given the lack of income opportunities and 
adverse conditions compounded by conflict situations. 
Warner et al. (2012) found the interrelationships between changing 
rainfall patterns, food and livelihood security in eight countries in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America. Several studies in Africa have found that 
persistent droughts and land degradation contributed to both seasonal 
and permanent migration (Gray 2011; Gray and Mueller 2012; Hummel 
2015; Henry et al. 2004; Folami and Folami 2013), worsening the 
vulnerability of different households (Dasgupta et al. 2014).
Dependency on rainfed agriculture ranges from 13% in Mexico to 
more than 30% in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, suggesting 
a  high degree of sensitivity to climate variability and change, 
and undermined food security (Warner et al. 2009). Studies have 
demonstrated that Mexican migration (Feng et al. 2010; Nawrotzki 
522
Chapter 5 
Food security
5
et al. 2013) and Central American migration (WFP 2017) fluctuate in 
response to climate variability. The food system is heavily dependent 
on maize and bean production and long-term climate change and 
variability significantly affect the productivity of these crops and 
the livelihoods of smallholder farmers (WFP 2017). In rural Ecuador, 
adverse environmental conditions prompt out-migration, although 
households respond to these challenges in diverse ways resulting in 
complex migratory responses (Gray and Bilsborrow 2013).
Migration patterns have been linked to heat stress in Pakistan 
(Mueller et al. 2014) and climate variability in the Sundarbans due 
to decline in food security (Guha and Roy 2016). In Bangladesh, the 
impacts of climate change have been on the rise throughout the 
last three decades with increasing migration, mostly of men leaving 
women and children to cope with increasing effects of natural 
disasters (Rabbani et al. 2015).
Small islands are very sensitive to climate change impacts (high 
confidence) (Nurse et al. 2014) and impacted by multiple climatic 
stressors (IPCC 2018a and SROCC). Food security in the Pacific, 
especially in Micronesia, has worsened in the past half century and 
climate change is likely to further hamper local food production, 
especially in low-lying atolls (Connell 2016). Migration in small 
islands (internally and internationally) occurs for multiple reasons and 
purposes, mostly for better livelihood opportunities (high confidence). 
Beyond rising sea levels, the effects of increasing frequency and 
intensity of extreme events such as severe tropical cyclones are likely 
to affect human migration in the Pacific (Connell 2015; Krishnapillai 
and Gavenda 2014; Charan et al. 2017; Krishnapillai 2017). On 
Yap Island, extreme weather events are affecting every aspect 
of atoll communities’ existence, mainly due to the islands’ small 
size, their low elevation, and extensive coastal areas (Krishnapillai 
2018). Displaced atoll communities on Yap Island grow a variety of 
nutritious vegetables and use alternative crop production methods 
such as small-plot intensive farming, raised bed gardening, as part 
of a  community-based adaptation programme (Krishnapillai and 
Gavenda 2014; Krishnapillai 2018). 
Recurrences of natural disasters and crises threaten food security 
through impacts on traditional agriculture, causing the forced 
migration and displacement of coastal communities to highlands in 
search of better living conditions. Although considerable differences 
occur in the physical manifestations of severe storms, such climate 
stressors threaten the life-support systems of many atoll communities 
(Campbell et al. 2014). The failure of these systems resulting from 
climate disasters propel vulnerable atoll communities into poverty 
traps, and low adaptive capacity could eventually force these 
communities to migrate. 
1.8.2.2 
Conflict 
While climate change will not alone cause conflict, it is often 
acknowledged as having the potential to exacerbate or catalyse conflict 
in conjunction with other factors. Increased resource competition 
can aggravate the potential for migration to lead to conflict. 
When populations continue to increase, competition for resources 
will also increase, and resources will become even scarcer due to 
climate change (Hendrix and Glaser 2007). In agriculture-dependent 
communities in low-income contexts, droughts have been found 
to increase the likelihood of violence and prolonged conflict at the 
local level, which eventually pose a threat to societal stability and 
peace (FAO et al. 2017). In contrast, conflicts can also have diverging 
effects on agriculture due to land abandonment, resulting in forest 
growth, or agriculture expansion causing deforestation, for example, 
in Colombia (Landholm et al. 2019).
Several studies have explored the causal links among climate change, 
drought, impacts on agricultural production, livelihoods, and civil 
unrest in Syria from 2007–2010, but without agreement as to the role 
played by climate in subsequent migration (Kelley et al. 2015, 2017; 
Challinor et al. 2018; Selby et al. 2017; Hendrix 2018). Contributing 
factors that have been examined include rainfall deficits, population 
growth, agricultural policies, and the influx of refugees that had 
placed burdens on the region’s water resources (Kelley et al. 2015). 
Drought may have played a role as a trigger, as this drought was the 
longest and the most intense in the last 900 years (Cook et al. 2016; 
Mathbout et al. 2018). Some studies linked the drought to widespread 
crop failure, but the climate hypothesis has been contested (Selby 
et al. 2017; Hendrix 2018). Recent evidence shows that the severe 
drought triggered agricultural collapse and displacement of rural farm 
families, with approximately 300,000 families going to Damascus, 
Aleppo and other cities (Kelley et al. 2017).
Persistent drought in Morocco during the early 1980s resulted in 
food riots and contributed to an economic collapse (El-Said and 
Harrigan 2014). A drought in Somalia that fuelled conflict through 
livestock price changes, establishing livestock markets as the primary 
channel of impact (Maystadt and Ecker 2014). Cattle raiding as 
a normal means of restocking during drought in the Great Horn of 
Africa led to conflict (ICPAC and WFP 2017) whereas a region-wide 
drought in northern Mali in 2012 wiped out thousands of livestock 
and devastated the livelihoods of pastoralists, in turn swelling the 
ranks of armed rebel factions and forcing others to steal and loot for 
survival (Breisinger et al. 2015). 
On the other hand, inter-annual adjustments in international trade can 
play an important role in shifting supplies from food surplus regions 
to regions facing food deficits which emerge as a  consequence of 
extreme weather events, civil strife, and/or other disruptions (Baldos 
and Hertel 2015). A more freely functioning global trading system is 
tested for its ability to deliver improved long run food security in 2050. 
In summary, given increasing extreme events and global and 
cross-sectoral interconnectedness, the food system is at increasing 
risk of disruption, for example, via migration and conflict (high 
confidence). {5.2.3, 5.2.4}

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 5.1 | 
How does climate change affect food 
security?
Climate change negatively affects all four pillars of food security: 
availability, access, utilisation and stability. Food availability may be 
reduced by negative climate change impacts on productivity of crops, 
livestock and fish, due, for instance, to increases in temperature 
and changes in rainfall patterns. Productivity is also negatively 
affected by increased pests and diseases, as well as changing 
distributions of pollinators under climate change. Food access and 
its stability may be affected through disruption of markets, prices, 
infrastructure, transport, manufacture, and retail, as well as direct 
and indirect changes in income and food purchasing power of 
low-income consumers. Food utilisation may be directly affected by 
climate change due to increases in mycotoxins in food and feed with 
rising temperatures and increased frequencies of extreme events, 
and indirectly through effects on health. Elevated atmospheric CO2 
concentrations can increase yields at lower temperature increases, 
but tend to decrease protein content in many crops, reducing their 
nutritional values. Extreme events, for example, flooding, will affect 
the stability of food supply directly through disruption of transport 
and markets. 
FAQ 5.2 | 
How can changing diets help address 
climate change?
Agricultural activities emit substantial amounts of greenhouse 
gases (GHGs). Food supply chain activities past the farm gate 
(e.g.,  transportation, storage, packaging) also emit GHGs, for 
instance due to energy use. GHG emissions from food production 
vary across food types. Producing animal-sourced food (e.g., meat 
and dairy) emits larger amount of GHGs than growing crops, 
especially in intensive, industrial livestock systems. This is mainly 
true for commodities produced by ruminant livestock such as cattle, 
due to enteric fermentation processes that are large emitters of 
methane. Changing diets towards a lower share of animal-sourced 
food, once implemented at scale, reduces the need to raise livestock 
and changes crop production from animal feed to human food. This 
reduces the need for agricultural land compared to present and thus 
generates changes in the current food system. From field to consumer 
this would reduce overall GHG emissions. Changes in consumer 
behaviour beyond dietary changes, such as reduction of food waste, 
can also have, at scale, effects on overall GHG emissions from food 
systems. Consuming regional and seasonal food can reduce GHG 
emissions, if they are grown efficiently.
