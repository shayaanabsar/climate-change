Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4

Executive Summary 
This chapter assesses past and future contributions to global, regional 
and extreme sea level changes, associated risk to low-lying islands, 
coasts, cities, and settlements, and response options and pathways to 
resilience and sustainable development along the coast.
Observations
Global mean sea level (GMSL) is rising (virtually certain1) 
and accelerating (high conﬁdence2). The sum of glacier and 
ice sheet contributions is now the dominant source of GMSL 
rise (very high conﬁdence). GMSL from tide gauges and altimetry 
observations increased from 1.4 mm yr–1 over the period 1901–1990 
to 2.1  mm yr–1 over the period 1970–2015 to 3.2  mm yr–1 over 
the period 1993–2015 to 3.6 mm yr–1 over the period 2006–2015 
(high conﬁdence). The dominant cause of GMSL rise since 1970 is 
anthropogenic forcing (high conﬁdence). {4.2.2.1.1, 4.2.2.2}
GMSL was considerably higher than today during past climate 
states that were warmer than pre-industrial, including the 
Last Interglacial (LIG; 129–116 ka), when global mean surface 
temperature was 0.5ºC–1.0ºC warmer, and the mid-Pliocene 
Warm Period (mPWP; ~3.3 to 3.0 million years ago), 2ºC–4ºC 
warmer. Despite the modest global warmth of the Last 
Interglacial, GMSL was  likely  6–9  m higher, mainly due to 
contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets 
(GIS and AIS, respectively), and unlikely more than 10m higher 
(medium conﬁdence). Based on new understanding about 
geological constraints since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report 
(AR5), 25 m is a plausible upper bound on GMSL during the 
mPWP (low conﬁdence). Ongoing uncertainties in palaeo sea level 
reconstructions and modelling hamper conclusions regarding the 
total magnitudes and rates of past sea level rise (SLR). Furthermore, 
the long (multi-millennial) time scales of these past climate and 
sea level changes, and regional climate inﬂuences from changes in 
Earth’s orbital conﬁguration and climate system feedbacks, lead to 
low conﬁdence in direct comparisons with near-term future changes.

Non-climatic 
anthropogenic 
drivers, 
including 
recent 
and historical demographic and settlement trends and 
anthropogenic subsidence, have played an important role 
in increasing low-lying coastal communities’ exposure and 
vulnerability to SLR and extreme sea level (ESL) events (very 
high conﬁdence). In coastal deltas, for example, these drivers have 
altered freshwater and sediment availability (high conﬁdence). In

Each ﬁnding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high and 
very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium conﬁdence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 
99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Assessed 
likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other AR6 Special Reports. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%, more likely than 
not >50–100%, more unlikely than likely 0–<50%, extremely unlikely 0–5%) are used when appropriate. This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ or ‘very likely range’ 
to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17–83% or 5–95% probability range. For more details see {1.9.2, Figure 1.4}.

Statements about uncertainty in Section 4.2 are contingent upon the RCP or other emissions assumptions that accompany them. In Section 4.4, the entirety of information 
facing a decision maker is taken into consideration, including the unknown path of future emissions, in assessing uncertainty. Depending on which perspective is chosen, 
uncertainty may or may not be characterised as ‘deep’.
low-lying coastal areas more broadly, human-induced changes can 
be rapid and modify coastlines over short periods of time, outpacing 
the effects of SLR (high conﬁdence). Adaptation can be undertaken in 
the short- to medium-term by targeting local drivers of exposure and 
vulnerability, notwithstanding uncertainty about local SLR impacts 
in coming decades and beyond (high conﬁdence). {4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 
4.3.2.2,  4.3.2.3}
Coastal ecosystems are already impacted by the combination 
of SLR, other climate-related ocean changes, and adverse 
effects from human activities on ocean and land (high 
conﬁdence). Attributing such impacts to SLR, however, remains 
challenging due to the inﬂuence of other climate-related and 
non-climatic drivers such as infrastructure development and 
human-induced habitat degradation (high conﬁdence). Coastal 
ecosystems, including saltmarshes, mangroves, vegetated dunes and 
sandy beaches, can build vertically and expand laterally in response 
to SLR, though this capacity varies across sites (high conﬁdence). 
These ecosystems provide important services that include coastal 
protection and habitat for diverse biota. However, as a consequence 
of human actions that fragment wetland habitats and restrict 
landward migration, coastal ecosystems progressively lose their 
ability to adapt to climate-induced changes and provide ecosystem 
services, including acting as protective barriers (high conﬁdence). 
{4.3.2.3}
Coastal risk is dynamic and increased by widely observed 
changes in coastal infrastructure, community livelihoods, 
agriculture and habitability (high conﬁdence). As with coastal 
ecosystems, attribution of observed changes and associated 
risk to SLR remains challenging. Drivers and processes inhibiting 
attribution include demographic, resource and land use changes and 
anthropogenic subsidence. {4.3.3, 4.3.4}
A diversity of adaptation responses to coastal impacts 
and risks have been implemented around the world, but 
mostly as a reaction to current coastal risk or experienced 
disasters (high conﬁdence). Hard coastal protection measures 
(dikes, embankments, sea walls and surge barriers) are widespread, 
providing predictable levels of safety in northwest Europe, East 
Asia, and around many coastal cities and deltas. Ecosystem-based 
adaptation (EbA) is continuing to gain traction worldwide, providing 
multiple co-beneﬁts, but there is still low agreement on its cost and 
long-term effectiveness. Advance, which refers to the creation of 
new land by building into the sea (e.g., land reclamation), has a long 
history in most areas where there are dense coastal populations. 
Accommodation measures, such as early warning systems (EWS) for 
ESL events, are widespread. Retreat is observed but largely restricted

to small communities or carried out for the purpose of creating new 
wetland habitat. {4.4.2.3, 4.4.2.4, 4.4.2.5}
Projections
Future rise in GMSL caused by thermal expansion, melting 
of glaciers and ice sheets and land water storage changes, is 
strongly dependent on which Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP) emission scenario is followed. SLR at the end 
of the century is projected to be faster under all scenarios, 
including those compatible with achieving the long-term 
temperature goal set out in the Paris Agreement. GMSL will 
rise between 0.43 m (0.29–0.59 m, likely range; RCP2.6) and 
0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m, likely range; RCP8.5) by 2100 (medium 
conﬁdence) relative to 1986–2005. Beyond 2100, sea level will 
continue to rise for centuries due to continuing deep ocean heat 
uptake and mass loss of the GIS and AIS and will remain elevated 
for thousands of years (high conﬁdence). Under RCP8.5, estimates 
for 2100 are higher and the uncertainty range larger than in AR5. 
Antarctica could contribute up to 28 cm of SLR (RCP8.5, upper end of 
likely range) by the end of the century (medium conﬁdence). Estimates 
of SLR higher than the likely range are also provided here for decision 
makers with low risk tolerance. {SR1.5, 4.1, 4.2.3.2, 4.2.3.5}
Under RCP8.5, the rate of SLR will be 15 mm yr–1 (10–20 mm yr–1, 
likely range) in 2100, and could exceed several cm yr–1 in the 
22nd century. These high rates challenge the implementation of 
adaptation measures that involve a long lead time, but this has not 
yet been studied in detail. {4.2.3.2, 4.4.2.2.3}
Processes controlling the timing of future ice shelf loss and 
the spatial extent of ice sheet instabilities could increase 
Antarctica’s contribution to SLR to values higher than 
the likely range on century and longer time scales (low 
conﬁdence). Evolution of the AIS beyond the end of the 21st century 
is characterized by deep uncertainty as ice sheet models lack realistic 
representations of some of the underlying physical processes. The 
few model studies available addressing time scales of centuries to 
millennia indicate multi-metre (2.3–5.4 m) rise in sea level for RCP8.5 
(low conﬁdence). There is low conﬁdence in threshold temperatures 
for ice sheet instabilities and the rates of GMSL rise they can produce. 
{Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 
and Sections 4.1, 4.2.3.1.1, 4.2.3.1.2, 4.2.3.6}
Sea level rise is not globally uniform and varies regionally. 
Thermal expansion, ocean dynamics and land ice loss 
contributions will generate regional departures of about ±30% 
around the GMSL rise. Differences from the global mean can be 
greater than ±30% in areas of rapid vertical land movements, 
including those caused by local anthropogenic factors such as 
groundwater extraction (high conﬁdence). Subsidence caused by 
human activities is currently the most important cause of relative sea 
level rise (RSL) change in many delta regions. While the comparative 
importance of climate-driven RSL rise will increase over time, these 
ﬁndings on anthropogenic subsidence imply that a consideration of 
local processes is critical for projections of sea level impacts at local 
scales (high conﬁdence). {4.2.1.6, 4.2.2.4}
Due to projected GMSL rise, ESLs that are historically rare (for 
example, today’s hundred-year event) will become common 
by 2100 under all RCPs (high conﬁdence). Many low-lying cities 
and small islands at most latitudes will experience such events 
annually by 2050. Greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation envisioned in 
low-emission scenarios (e.g., RCP2.6) is expected to sharply reduce 
but not eliminate risk to low-lying coasts and islands from SLR and 
ESL events. Low-emission scenarios lead to slower rates of SLR  
and allow for a wider range of adaptation options. For the ﬁrst half 
of the 21st century differences in ESL events among the scenarios are 
small, facilitating adaptation planning. {4.2.2.5, 4.2.3.4}
Non-climatic anthropogenic drivers will continue to increase 
the exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities to future 
SLR and ESL events in the absence of major adaptation efforts 
compared to today (high conﬁdence). {4.3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
The expected impacts of SLR on coastal ecosystems over 
the course of the century include habitat contraction, loss 
of functionality and biodiversity, and lateral and inland 
migration. Impacts will be exacerbated in cases of land 
reclamation and where anthropogenic barriers prevent inland 
migration of marshes and mangroves and limit the availability 
and relocation of sediment (high conﬁdence). Under favourable 
conditions, marshes and mangroves have been found to keep pace 
with fast rates of SLR (e.g., >10 mm yr–1), but this capacity varies 
signiﬁcantly depending on factors such as wave exposure of the 
location, tidal range, sediment trapping, overall sediment availability 
and coastal squeeze (high conﬁdence). {4.3.3.5.1}
In the absence of adaptation, more intense and frequent ESL 
events, together with trends in coastal development will 
increase expected annual ﬂood damages by 2–3 orders of 
magnitude by 2100 (high conﬁdence). However, well designed 
coastal protection is very effective in reducing expected 
damages and cost efﬁcient for urban and densely populated 
regions, but generally unaffordable for rural and poorer areas 
(high conﬁdence). Effective protection requires investments on the 
order of tens to several hundreds of billions of USD yr–1 globally (high 
conﬁdence). While investments are generally cost efﬁcient for densely 
populated and urban areas (high conﬁdence), rural and poorer areas 
will be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual 
costs for some small island states amounting to several percent of 
GDP (high conﬁdence). Even with well-designed hard protection, the 
risk of possibly disastrous consequences in the event of failure of 
defences remains. {4.3.4, 4.4.2.2, 4.4.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
Risk related to SLR (including erosion, ﬂooding and 
salinisation) is expected to signiﬁcantly increase by the end of 
this century along all low-lying coasts in the absence of major 
additional adaptation efforts (very high conﬁdence). While 
only urban atoll islands and some Arctic communities are expected 
to experience moderate to high risk relative to today in a low 
emission pathway, almost high to very high risks are expected in all 
325
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4

low-lying coastal settings at the upper end of the likely range for high 
emission pathways (medium conﬁdence). However,  the transition 
from moderate to high and from high to very high risk will vary from 
one coastal setting to another (high conﬁdence). While a slower 
rate of SLR enables greater opportunities for adapting, adaptation 
beneﬁts are also expected to vary between coastal settings. Although 
ambitious adaptation will not necessarily eradicate end-century SLR 
risk (medium conﬁdence), it will help to buy time in many locations 
and therefore help to lay a robust foundation for adaptation beyond 
2100. {4.1.3, 4.3.4, Box 4.1, SM4.2}
Choosing and Implementing Responses
All types of responses to SLR, including protection, 
accommodation, EbA, advance and retreat, have important 
and synergistic roles to play in an integrated and sequenced 
response to SLR (high conﬁdence). Hard protection and advance 
(building into the sea) are economically efﬁcient in most urban 
contexts facing land scarcity (high conﬁdence), but can lead to 
increased exposure in the long term. Where sufﬁcient space is 
available, EbA can both reduce coastal risks and provide multiple 
other beneﬁts (medium conﬁdence). Accommodation such as ﬂood 
prooﬁng buildings and EWS for ESL events are often both low-cost and 
highly cost-efﬁcient in all contexts (high conﬁdence). Where coastal 
risks are already high, and population size and density are low, or in 
the aftermath of a coastal disaster, retreat may be especially effective, 
albeit socially, culturally and politically challenging. {4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.3, 
4.4.2.4, 4.4.2.5, 4.4.2.6, 4.4.3}
Technical limits to hard protection are expected to be reached 
under high emission scenarios (RCP8.5) beyond 2100 (high 
conﬁdence) and biophysical limits to EbA may arise during 
the 21st century, but economic and social barriers arise well 
before the end of the century (medium conﬁdence). Economic 
challenges to hard protection increase with higher sea levels and will 
make adaptation unaffordable before technical limits are reached 
(high conﬁdence). Drivers other than SLR are expected to contribute 
more to biophysical limits of EbA. For corals, limits may be reached 
during this century, due to ocean acidiﬁcation and ocean warming, 
and for tidal wetlands due to pollution and infrastructure limiting 
their inland migration. Limits to accommodation are expected to occur 
well before limits to protection occur. Limits to retreat are uncertain, 
reﬂecting research gaps. Social barriers (including governance 
challenges) to adaptation are already encountered. {4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.3., 
4.4.2.3.2, 4.4.2.5, 4.4.2.6, 4.4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
Choosing and implementing responses to SLR presents society 
with profound governance challenges and difﬁcult social choices, 
which are inherently political and value laden (high conﬁdence). 
The large uncertainties about post 2050 SLR, and the substantial 
impact expected, challenge established planning and decision 
making practises and introduce the need for coordination within and 
between governance levels and policy domains. SLR responses also 
raise equity concerns about marginalising those most vulnerable and 
could potentially spark or compound social conﬂict (high conﬁdence). 
Choosing and implementing responses is further challenged through a 
lack of resources, vexing trade-offs between safety, conservation and 
economic development, multiple ways of framing the ‘sea level rise 
problem’, power relations, and various coastal stakeholders having 
conﬂicting interests in the future development of heavily used coastal 
zones (high conﬁdence). {4.4.2, 4.4.3}
Despite the large uncertainties about post 2050 SLR, 
adaptation decisions can be made now, facilitated by using 
decision analysis methods speciﬁcally designed to address 
uncertainty (high conﬁdence). These methods favour ﬂexible 
responses (i.e., those that can be adapted over time) and periodically 
adjusted decisions (i.e.,  adaptive decision making). They use 
robustness criteria (i.e., effectiveness across a range of circumstances) 
for evaluating alternative responses instead of standard expected 
utility criteria (high conﬁdence). One example is adaptation pathway 
analysis, which has emerged as a low-cost tool to assess long-term 
coastal responses as sequences of adaptive decisions in the face of 
dynamic coastal risk characterised by deep uncertainty (medium 
evidence, high agreement). The range of SLR to be considered 
in decisions depends on the risk tolerance of stakeholders, with 
stakeholders whose risk tolerance is low also considering SLR higher 
than the likely range. {4.1, 4.4.4.3}
Adaptation experience to date demonstrates that using a 
locally appropriate combination of decision analysis, land 
use planning, public participation and conﬂict resolution 
approaches can help to address the governance challenges 
faced in responding to SLR (high conﬁdence). Effective SLR 
responses depend, ﬁrst, on taking a long-term perspective when 
making short-term decisions, explicitly accounting for uncertainty of 
locality-speciﬁc risks beyond 2050 (high conﬁdence), and building 
governance capabilities to tackle the complexity of SLR risk (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Second, improved coordination of SLR 
responses across scales, sectors and policy domains can help to 
address SLR impacts and risk (high conﬁdence). Third, prioritising 
consideration of social vulnerability and equity underpins efforts to 
promote fair and just climate resilience and sustainable development 
(high conﬁdence) and can be helped by creating safe community 
arenas for meaningful public deliberation and conﬂict resolution 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Finally, public awareness and 
understanding about SLR risks and responses can be improved by 
drawing on local, indigenous and scientiﬁc knowledge systems, 
together with social learning about locality-speciﬁc SLR risk and 
response potential (high conﬁdence). {4.4.4.2, 4.4.5, Table 4.9}
Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) and charting Climate Resilient Development Pathways 
depends in part on ambitious and sustained mitigation 
efforts to contain SLR coupled with effective adaptation 
actions to reduce SLR impacts and risk (medium evidence, 
high agreement).

4.1 
Synthesis 
4.1.1 
Purpose, Scope, and Structure of this Chapter
This chapter assesses the literature published since the AR5 on 
past and future contributions to global, regional and ESL changes, 
associated risk to low-lying islands, coasts, cities and settlements, 
and response options and pathways to resilience and sustainable 
development along the coast. The chapter follows the risk framework 
of AR5, in which risk is assessed in terms of hazard, exposure and 
vulnerability (Cross-Chapter Box  1 Chapter  1; Box  4.1), and is 
structured as follows (Figure 4.1):
• Section 4.1 (this section) presents a high-level synthesis of our 
assessment and provides entry points to more speciﬁc content 
found in the other sections.
• Section  4.2 assesses the current understanding of processes 
contributing to mean and extreme SLR globally, regionally 
and locally, with an emphasis on new insights about the AIS 
contribution. 
• Section 4.3 assesses how mean and extreme sea level changes 
translate into coastal hazards (e.g., ﬂooding, erosion and salinity 
intrusion), how these interact with socioeconomic drivers of 
coastal exposure and vulnerability, and how this interaction 
translates into observed impacts and projected risks for 
ecosystems, natural resources and human systems.
• Section 4.4 assesses the cost, effectiveness, co-beneﬁts, efﬁciency, 
and technical limits of different types of SLR responses and 
identiﬁes governance challenges (also called barriers) associated 
with choosing and implementing responses. Next, planning, 
public participation, conﬂict resolution and decision analysis 
methods for addressing the identiﬁed governance challenges are 
assessed, as well as practical lessons learned in local cases.
4.1.2 
Future Sea level Rise and Implications 
for Responses
For understanding responses to climate-change induced SLR, two 
aspects of sea level are important to note initially:
1. Climate-change induced GMSL rise is caused by thermal expansion 
of ocean water and ocean mass gain, the latter primarily due to a 
decrease in land-ice mass. However, responses to SLR are local and 
hence always based on RSL experienced at a particular location. 
GMSL is modiﬁed regionally by climate processes and locally by 
a variety of factors, some driven or inﬂuenced by human activity. 
Of particular relevance for responding to SLR is anthropogenic 
subsidence, which can lead to rates of RSL rise that exceed those 
of climate-induced SLR by an order of magnitude, speciﬁcally in 
delta regions and near cities (4.2.2.4). In these subsiding regions, 
one available response to prepare for future climate-induced SLR 
is to manage and reduce anthropogenic subsidence (4.4.2).
2. The combination of gradual change of mean sea level with 
ESL events such as tides, surges and waves causes coastal 
impacts (4.2.3). ESL events at the coast that are rare today 
will become more frequent in the future, which means that for 
many locations, the main starting point for coastal planning

and decision making is information on current and future ESL 
events. One important response for preparing for future SLR is 
to improve observational systems (tide gauges, wave buoys and 
remote sensing techniques), because in many places around the 
world current frequencies and intensities of ESL events are not 
well understood due to a lack of observational data (4.2.3.4.1).
After an increase of sea level from 1–2 mm yr–1 in most regions over 
the past century, rates of 3–4 mm yr–1 are now being experienced that 
will further increase to 4–9 mm yr–1 under RCP2.6 and 10–20 mm yr–1 
at the end of the century under RCP8.5. Nevertheless, up to 2050, 
uncertainty in climate change-driven future sea level is relatively 
small, which provides a robust basis for short-term (£30 years) 
adaptation planning. GMSL will rise between 0.24 m (0.17–0.32 m, 
likely range) under RCP2.6 and 0.32 m (0.23–0.40 m, likely range) 
under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence; 4.2.3). The combined effect of 
mean and extreme sea levels results in events which are rare in the 
historical context (return period of 100 years or larger; probability 
<0.01 yr–1) occurring yearly at some locations by the middle of this 
century under all emission scenarios (4.2.3.4.1; high conﬁdence). This 
includes, for instance, those parts of the intertropical low-lying coasts 
that are currently exposed to storm surges only infrequently. Hence, 
additional adaptation is needed irrespective of the uncertainties in 
future global GHG emissions and the Antarctic contribution to SLR.
Beyond 2050, uncertainty in climate change induced SLR increases 
substantially due to uncertainties in emission scenarios and the 
associated climate changes, and the response of the AIS in a warmer 
world. Combining process-model based studies in which there is medium 
conﬁdence, it is found that GMSL is projected to rise between 0.43 m 
(0.29–0.59 m, likely range) under RCP 2.6 and 0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m, 
likely range) under RCP 8.5 by 2100 (Figure 4.3). The range that needs 
to be considered for planning and implementing coastal responses 
depends on the risk tolerance of stakeholders (i.e.,  those deciding 
and those affected by a decision; 4.4.4.3.2). Stakeholders that are risk 
tolerant (e.g., those planning for investments that can be very easily 
adapted to unforeseen conditions) may prefer to use the likely ranges 
of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for long-term adaptation planning. Stakeholders 
with a low risk tolerance (e.g., those planning for coastal safety in cities 
and long term investment in critical infrastructure) may also consider 
SLR above this range, because there is a 17% chance that GMSL 
will exceed 0.59 m under RCP2.6 and 1.10 m under RCP8.5 in 2100. 
Process-model based studies cannot yet provide this information, but 
expert elicitation studies show that a GMSL of 2 m in 2100 cannot be 
ruled out (4.2.3).
Despite the large uncertainty in late 21st century SLR, progress in 
adaptation planning and implementation is feasible today and may be 
economically beneﬁcial. Many coastal decisions with time horizons of 
decades to over a century are made today (e.g., critical infrastructure, 
coastal protection works, city planning, etc.) and accounting for 
relative SLR can improve these decisions. Decision-analysis methods 
speciﬁcally targeting situations of large uncertainty are available and, 
combined with suitable planning, public participation and conﬂict 
resolution processes, can improve outcomes (high conﬁdence; 4.4.4.2, 
4.4.4.3). For example, adaptation pathway analysis recognises and 
enables sequenced long-term decision making in the face of dynamic 
coastal risk characterised by deep uncertainty (medium evidence, high 
agreement; 4.4.4.3.4). The use of these decision-analysis tools can 
be integrated into statutory land use or spatial planning provisions 
to formalise these decisions and enable effective implementation by 
relevant governing authorities (4.4.4.2).

Beyond 2100, sea level will continue to rise for centuries and will 
remain elevated for thousands of years (high conﬁdence; 4.2.3.5). 
Only a few modelling studies are available for SLR beyond 2100. 
However, all studies agree that the difference in GMSL between 
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 increases substantially on multi-centennial and 
millennial time scales (very high conﬁdence). On a millennial time 
scale, this difference is about 10 metres in some model simulations, 
whereas it is only several decimetres at the end of 21st century. 
The larger the emissions the larger the risks associated with SLR as 
already assessed in SR1.5. Under RCP8.5 the few available studies 
indicate a likely range of 2.3–5.4 m (low conﬁdence) in 2300. With 
strong mitigation efforts (RCP2.6), SLR will be kept to a likely range 
of 0.6–1.1  m (Figure  4.2). Regardless, ambitious and sustained 
adaptation efforts are needed to reduce risks.
4.1.3 
Sea Level Rise Impacts and Implications 
for Responses
Rising mean and increasingly extreme sea level threaten coastal 
zones through a range of coastal hazards including (i) the permanent 
submergence of land by higher mean sea levels or mean high tides; 
(ii) more frequent or intense coastal ﬂooding; (iii) enhanced coastal 
erosion; (iv) loss and change of coastal ecosystems; (v) salinisation 
of soils, ground and surface water; and (vi) impeded drainage. 
At the century scale and without adaptation, the vast majority 
of low-lying islands, coasts and communities face substantial 
risk from these coastal hazards, whether they are urban or rural, 
continental or island, at any latitude, and irrespective of their level 
of development (Section 4.3.4; Figure 4.3; high conﬁdence). In the 
absence of an ambitious increase in adaptation efforts compared 
to those currently underway, high to very high risks are expected 
in many coastal geographies at the upper end of the RCP8.5 likely 
range. These include resource-rich coastal cities, urban atoll islands, 
densely populated deltas, and Arctic communities (Chapter 4 Box 4; 
Figure 4.3 and Section 4.3.4). At the same time coastal protection 
is very effective and cost-efﬁcient for cities but not for less densely 
populated rural areas. Some geographies, such as urban atoll 
islands and Arctic communities face moderate to high risk even 
under RCP2.6 (medium conﬁdence). 
In many places, however, non SLR-related, local environmental and 
human dimensions of exposure and vulnerability play a critical 
role in increasing exposure and vulnerability to coastal hazards 
(Section  4.3.2.5). For example, the ability of morphological and 
ecological systems (Sections 4.3.3.3 and 4.3.3.5) to protect human 
settlements and infrastructure by attenuating ESL events and 
stabilising shorelines is progressively being lost due to coastal squeeze, 
pollution, habitat degradation and fragmentation (Section 4.3.3.5.4; 
high conﬁdence). Hence, an important near term response to RSL rise 
is to reduce these adverse environmental and human dimensions 
of exposure and vulnerability. In addition, the drivers of exposure 
and vulnerability vary across different coastal contexts ranging 
from resource-rich cities to small islands (Sections 4.3.3, 4.3.4). 
Accordingly, effective responses need to be context-speciﬁc, and 
address the locality-speciﬁc drivers of risk.

methodology and the ﬁndings, while SM4.3 provides details. Left-hand panel describes global mean sea level (GMSL) rise observations for the Present-Day (1986–2005) 
and projections under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 by 2100 relative to the Present-Day according to advances in this chapter. Relative sea level (RSL) changes at speciﬁc locations 
are represented by the coloured blocs (range of the real-world case studies used) and coloured dotted lines (mean) at the background of the middle panel, which describes 
risk to illustrative geographies as assessed in this chapter. Each illustrative geography is supported by real-world case studies described in the literature (Box 4.1, 4.3.4.1 
and Table SM4.2.5): three for resource-rich coastal cities, three for urban atoll islands, two for large tropical agricultural deltas, ﬁve for Arctic communities. N.B. (1): Only 
Arctic communities remote from regions of rapid glacial-isostatic adjustment have been selected for this assessment. N.B (2): according to the speciﬁc scope of the chapter, 
this assessment focuses on the additional risks due to SLR and does not account for changes in extreme event climatology (Sections 4.2.3.4.1 to 4.2.3.4.3, 6.3.1.1 to 
6.3.1.3), which in some cases would imply a different level of risk than assessed here. The middle panel also distinguishes between two adaptation scenarios. (A) ‘No-to-
moderate response’ represents a business-as-usual scenario where no major additional adaptation efforts compared to today’s level of effort are implemented (i.e., neither 
further signiﬁcant intensiﬁcation of action nor new types of actions). (B) ‘Maximum potential response’ represents the opposite situation, that is, an ambitious combination 
of both incremental and transformational adaptation that leads to signiﬁcant additional efforts compared to today and to (A). Here, the authors assume adaptation 
implemented at its full potential, that is, the extent of adaptation that is technologically possible, with minimal ﬁnancial, social and political barriers.

4.1.4 
Response Options, Governance Challenges 
and Ways Forward
Responding to SLR refers to reducing hazards, exposure and 
vulnerability of low-lying coastal areas. It can be approached in 
fundamentally different ways and ﬁve major categories are described 
in this chapter (Box 4.3): Protection reduces coastal risk and impacts 
by blocking the inland propagation and other effects of mean or 
extreme sea levels hazards (e.g.,  through dikes, seawalls, storm 
surge barriers, breakwaters, beach-dune systems, etc.). Advance 
creates new land by building seawards (e.g., reclamation of new land 
above sea levels or planting vegetation with the speciﬁc intention 
to support natural accretion of land). Ecosystem-based adaptation 
(EbA) provides a combination of the beneﬁts of protect and advance 
strategies based on the conservation and restoration of ecosystems 
such as reefs and coastal vegetation. Accommodation includes a 
diverse set of biophysical and institutional responses to reduce 
vulnerability of coastal residents, human activities, ecosystems and 
the built environment (e.g., raising buildings, planting salt tolerant 
crops, insurance and EWS for ESL events). Retreat reduces exposure 
to coastal hazards by moving people, assets and human activities out 
of the exposed coastal area.
Each type of response has particular advantages and disadvantages, 
and may play a synergistic role in an integrated and sequenced 
response to SLR. For example, hard protection needs less space and 
its effectiveness is more predictable than for EbA (high conﬁdence; 
4.4.2.2.4, 4.4.2.3.4). EbA has advantages of contributing to 
conservation goals and providing additional ecosystem services such 
as carbon sequestration and improved water quality (4.4.2.2.5). EbA 
can become more effective over time, because coastal ecosystems can 
migrate inland with rising sea levels, provided this is not restricted 
by infrastructure (4.4.2.2.4). In practise, hard, sediment-based and 
ecosystem-based protection responses are often combined and there 
is high agreement that such hybrid approaches are a promising way 
forward (4.4.2.3.1). Advance is an option widely practised when land 
is scarce and offers the opportunity to ﬁnance adaptation through 
land sale revenues, but can also increase exposure and destroy coastal 
wetlands and their protective function (4.4.2.4). Accommodation 
measures such as ﬂood prooﬁng buildings, ﬂood forecasting, early 
warning and emergency planning have high beneﬁt-cost ratios, 
which means that implementing them is much cheaper than doing 
nothing (4.4.2.5.6). Retreat, and avoidance of development in some 
locations, are the only types of responses that eliminate residual 
risks, assuming there is sufﬁciently safe alternative land to retreat to 
or develop (4.4.2.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9). 
Given diverse geographies and contexts (4.1.3), and the pros and 
cons of different responses, there is no silver bullet for responding to 
SLR. Rather, each coastal locality requires a tailor-made response that 
uses an appropriate mix of measures, sequenced over time as sea 
level rises. Possible integrated response strategies are illustrated for 
two contrasting types of settlements: densely populated urban and 
sparsely populated rural coasts.
For densely populated urban low elevation areas, including continental 
and island cities and megacities, hard protection has played and 
will continue to play the central role in response strategies (4.4.2.2, 
Box 4.1). In general, it is technologically feasible and economically 
efﬁcient to protect large parts of cities against 21st century SLR (high 
conﬁdence; 4.4.2.2.4, 4.4.2.7). However, questions of affordability 
remain for poorer and developing regions (4.3.3.4, 4.4.2.2.3). In 
cities, advance can offer a way to ﬁnance coastal protection through 
revenues generated from newly created land (4.4.2.4), but raises 
equity concerns with regard to the distribution of costs and access 
to the new land (4.4.2.4.6). Where space is available, EbA can 
supplement hard protection (4.4.2.3), except in situations where 
other human interventions, like infrastructure and pollution, interfere 
with EbA, especially for RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 9). Retreat may 
currently be favoured over rebuilding in the aftermath of major 
ﬂooding disasters, but in densely populated areas protected by hard 
infrastructure, general retreat need not be considered until later in 
the century once it is known whether or not SLR will reach the higher 
end of the projections (1.1 m or more by 2100; 4.4.2.6).
Along sparsely populated rural coasts, safeguarding communities 
by conserving coastal ecosystems and natural morphodynamic 
processes, and restoring those already degraded, is the central 
element of an integrated strategy. Intact coastal ecosystems can 
protect settlements and, in some contexts, natural sedimentation 
processes and avoiding sand mining can help to raise exposed land 
(4.4.2.2). Hard coastal protection can lead to ﬂooding or erosion 
elsewhere (4.4.2.2.5), and the destruction of ecosystems and the 
coastal protection they offer (4.3.3.5). Ecosystem health can be 
further maintained by reducing non-climatic drivers such as those 
that interrupt sediment ﬂows in deltas and estuaries (4.3.2.3). Hard 
protection may be appropriate for areas containing high value assets 
(e.g.,  settlements and cultural sites). Retreat is worth considering 
now where coastal population size and density is low, risks are 
already high, and the economic, cultural and sociopolitical impacts of 
retreat and resettlement are carefully considered and addressed by 
at-risk communities and their governing authorities.
Designing and implementing an appropriate mix of responses is not 
only a technical task but also an inherently political and value-laden 
social choice that involves trade-offs between multiple values, goals 
and interests (Section 4.4.3). Speciﬁcally, distinctive features of SLR 
together with this complex nature of social choices give rise to ﬁve 
overarching governance challenges (Section 4.4.3.3):
1. Time horizon and uncertainty associated with SLR beyond 
2050 challenge standard planning and decision making practises 
(high conﬁdence).
2. Cross-scale and cross-domain coordination linking differing 
jurisdictional levels, sectors and policy domains is often needed 
for effective responses (medium conﬁdence).
3. Equity and social vulnerability are often negatively affected 
by SLR and also  responses to SLR, which can undermine societal 
aspirations such as achieving the SDGs (high conﬁdence).
4. Social conﬂict (i.e.,  nonviolent struggle between groups, 
organisations and communities over values, interests, resources, 
and inﬂuence or power) caused or exacerbated by SLR could 
escalate over time and become very difﬁcult to resolve 
(high conﬁdence).

5. Complexity, reinforced by the combination of the above 
challenges, makes it difﬁcult to understand and address SLR 
(high conﬁdence).
These governance challenges can be addressed through an integrated 
combination of well-established and emerging planning, public 
participation and conﬂict resolution practices (Section  4.4.4.2), 
decision analysis methods (Section 4.4.4.3) and enabling conditions 
(Section 4.4.5). For example, iterative planning and ﬂexible, adaptive 
and robust decision making (RDM) can help coastal communities to 
plan for the future and account for SLR uncertainty. Planning can also 
enable thinking and action across spatial, temporal and governance 
scales and thus help to coordinate roles and responsibilities across 
multiple governance levels. Public participation approaches can be 
designed to account for divergent perspectives in making difﬁcult 
social choices, enhancing social learning, experimentation and 
innovation in developing locally appropriate SLR responses. Conﬂict 
resolution approaches have considerable potential to improve 
adaptation prospects by harnessing the productive potential of 
nonviolent conﬂict.
4.2 
Physical Basis for Sea Level Change  
and Associated Hazards
As a consequence of natural and anthropogenic changes in the 
climate system, sea level changes are occurring on temporal and 
spatial scales that threaten coastal communities, cities, and low-lying 
islands. Sea level in this context means the time average height of 
the sea surface, thus eliminating short duration ﬂuctuations like 
waves, surges and tides. GMSL rise refers to an increase in the 
volume of ocean water caused by warmer water having a lower 
density, and by the increase in mass caused by loss of land ice or a 
net loss in terrestrial water reservoirs. Spatial variations in volume 
changes are related to spatial changes in the climate. In addition, 
mass changes due to the redistribution of water on the Earth’s 
surface and deformation of the lithosphere leads to a change in the 
Earth’s rotation and gravitational ﬁeld, producing distinct spatial 
patterns in regional sea level change. In addition to the regional 
changes associated with contemporary ice and water redistribution, 
the solid Earth may cause sea level changes due to tectonics, mantle 
dynamics or glacial isostatic adjustment (see Section 4.2.1.5). These 
processes cause vertical land motion (VLM) and sea surface height 
changes at coastlines. Hence, RSL change is deﬁned as the change in 
the difference in elevation between the land and the sea surface at a 
speciﬁc time and location (Farrell and Clark, 1976). Here, regional sea 
level refers to spatial scales of around 100 km, while local sea level 
refers to spatial scales smaller than 10 km. 
In most places around the world, current annual mean rates of RSL 
changes are typically on the order of a few mm yr–1 (see Figure 4.6). 
Risk associated with changing sea level also is related to individual 
events that have a limited duration, superimposed on the background 
of these gradual changes. As a result, the gradual changes in time 
and space have to be assessed together with processes that lead 
to ﬂooding and erosion events. These processes include storm 
surges, waves and tides or a combination of these processes and 
lead to ESL events (see Figure 4.4). In this section, newly emerging 
understanding of these different episodic and gradual aspects of 
sea level change are assessed, within a context of sea level changes 
measured directly over the last century, and those inferred for longer 
geological time scales. This longer-term perspective is important for 
contextualising future projections of sea level and providing guidance 
for process-based models of the individual components of SLR, in 
particular the ice sheets. In addition, anthropogenic subsidence may 
affect local sea level substantially in many locations but this process 
is not taken into account in values reported here for projected SLR 
unless speciﬁcally noted.
4.2.1 
Processes of Sea Level Change
Sea level changes have been discussed throughout the various 
IPCC assessment reports as SLR is a key feature of climate change. 
Complex interactions between the oceans and ice sheets only 
recently have been recognised as important drivers of processes that 
can lead to rapid dynamical changes in the ice sheets. Understanding 
of basal melt below the ice shelves, ice calving processes and glacial 
hydrological processes was also limited. Projections of future sea 
level in the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (AR4; Lemke et al., 2007) 
were presented with the caveat that dynamical ice sheet processes 
were not accounted for, as our physical understanding of these 
processes was too rudimentary and no literature could be assessed 
(Bindoff et al., 2007). In AR5 (Church et al., 2013), a ﬁrst attempt 
was made to quantify the dynamic contribution of the ice sheets, 
although still with modeling based on limited physcis, relying mainly 
on an extrapolation of existing observations (Little et al., 2013) and 
a single process based case study (Bindschadler et al., 2013). Here 
the focus is on sea level changes around coastlines and low-lying 
islands, updating the GMSL rise by including a new estimate of the 
dynamic contribution of Antarctica. The mechanism driving past and 
contemporary sea level changes and episodic extremes of sea level is 
explained, and conﬁdence in regional projections of future sea level 
over the 21st century and beyond is assessed. 
4.2.1.1 
Ice Sheets and Ice Shelves
The ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica contain most of the 
fresh water on the Earth’s surface. As a consequence, they have the 
greatest potential to cause changes in sea level. Figure 4.4 illustrates 
the size of land ice reservoirs and the most important processes that 
drive mass changes of ice sheets.
Ice sheets change sea level through the loss or gain of ice above 
ﬂotation, deﬁned as the ice thickness in exceedance of the smallest 
thickness that would remain in contact with the sea ﬂoor at 
hydrostatic equilibrium. The GIS is currently losing mass at roughly 
twice the pace of the AIS (Table 4.1). However, Antarctica contains 
eight times more ice above ﬂotation than Greenland. Furthermore, 
a substantial fraction of the AIS rests on bedrock below sea level, 
making the ice sheet responsive to changes in ocean-driven melt and 
possibly vulnerable to marine ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter 
Box 8 in Chapter 3) that can drive rapid mass loss.
331
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4

Ice sheets gain or lose mass through changes in surface mass 
balance (SMB), the sum of accumulation and ablation controlled 
by atmospheric processes, the loss of ice to the ocean though 
melting of ice shelves, and by calving (breaking off of ice bergs) at 
marine-terminating ice fronts (see Chapter 3). Ice shelves, the ﬂoating 
extensions of grounded ice ﬂowing into the ocean (Figure 4.4) do not 
directly contribute to sea level, but they play an important role in 
ice sheet dynamics by providing resistance to the seaward ﬂow of 
the grounded ice upstream (Fürst et al., 2016; Reese et al., 2018b). 
Ice shelves gain mass through the inﬂow of ice from the ice sheet, 
precipitation, and accretion at the ice-ocean interface. They lose 
mass through a combination of calving and by melting from below, 
especially where basal ice is in contact with warm water (Paolo et al., 
2015, Khazendar et al., 2016). Calving rates at the terminus of marine 
terminating ice fronts are governed by complex ice-mechanical 
processes, the internal strength of the ice, and interaction with 
ocean waves and tides (Benn et al., 2007; Bassis, 2011; Massom 
et al., 2018). Sub-ice shelf melts rates are controlled by ice-ocean 
interactions involving the large-scale circulation, more localised 
heat and fresh water ﬂuxes, and micro (mm)-scale processes in 
the ice-ocean boundary layer (Gayen et al., 2015; Dinniman et al., 
2016; Schodlok et al., 2016). Ice shelves are also impacted by surface 
processes. Where surface melt rates are high, ice shelves not only 
lose mass, they can collapse (hydrofracture) from ﬂexural stresses 
caused by the movement of the meltwater and the deepening of 
water-ﬁlled crevasses (Banwell et al., 2013; Macayeal and Sergienko, 
2013; Kuipers Munneke et al., 2014). These complex ice-ocean 
interactions, calving and hydrofracture processes remain difﬁcult to 
model, particularly at the scale of ice sheets.
Our understanding of ice sheets has progressed substantially since 
AR5, although deep uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1) 
remains with regard to their potential contribution to future SLR on 
time scales longer than a century under any given emissions scenario. 
This is particularly true for Antarctica.
4.2.1.2 
Glaciers
Glaciers outside of the GIS and AIS are important contributors to sea 
level change (Figure 4.4). Because of their speciﬁc accumulation and 
ablation rates, which are often high compared to those of the ice 
sheets, they are sensitive indicators of climate change and respond 
quickly to changes in  climate. Over the past century, glaciers have 
added more mass to the ocean than the GIS and AIS combined 
(Gregory et al., 2013). However, the mass of glaciers is small by 
comparison, equivalent to only 0.32 ± 0.08 m mean SLR if only the 
fraction of ice above sea level is considered (Farinotti et al., 2019). 
Sections 2.2.3, 3.3.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2 provide a 
detailed discussion of glacier response to climate change. 
4.2.1.3 
Ocean Processes
In general, increasing temperatures lead to a lower density (‘thermal 
expansion’) and therefore the larger its volume per unit of mass. 
Thus, warming leads to a higher sea level even when the ocean mass 
remains constant. Over at least the last 1500 years changes in sea level 
were related to global mean temperatures (Kopp et al., 2016), partly 
because of ice mass loss, and partly because of thermal expansion. 
Models and observations indicate that over recent decades, more 
than 90% of the increase in energy in the climate system has been 
stored in the ocean. Hence, thermal expansion provides insight into 
climate sensitivity (Church et al., 2013). Findings from sea level 
studies and the energy budget are consistent (Otto et al., 2013). As 
thermal expansion per degree is dependent on the temperature itself, 
heat uptake by a warm region has a larger impact on SLR than heat 
uptake by a cold region. This contributes to regional changes in sea 
level, which are also caused by the water temperature and salinity 
variations (e.g.,  Lowe and Gregory, 2006; Suzuki and Ishii, 2011; 
Bouttes et al., 2014; Saenko et al., 2015). Regional patterns in sea 
level change are also modiﬁed from the global average by oceanic 
and atmospheric (ﬂuid) dynamics (Grifﬁes and Greatbatch, 2012), 
including trends in ocean currents, redistribution of temperature and 
salinity (sea water density), buoyancy, and atmospheric pressure. An 
analysis of these trends in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 
Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs; Yin, 2012) 
demonstrates the potential for >15 cm of SLR by 2100 and >30 cm 
by 2300 (RCP8.5) along the east coast of the USA and Canada 
from ﬂuid dynamical processes alone. However, Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) GCM simulations are not 
yet available for an updated analysis of these processes in SROCC.
4.2.1.4 
Terrestrial Reservoirs
Global sea level changes are also affected by changes in terrestrial 
reservoirs of liquid water. Withdrawal of groundwater and storage 
of fresh water through dam construction (Chao et al., 2008; Fiedler 
and Conrad, 2010) in the earlier parts of the 20th century dominated, 
leading to sea level fall, but in recent decades, land water depletion 
due to domestic, agricultural and industrial usage has begun to 
contribute to sea level change (Wada et al., 2017). Changes in 
terrestrial reservoirs may also be related to climate variability: in 
particular, the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has a strong 
impact on precipitation distribution and temporary storage of water 
on continents (Boening et al., 2012; Cazenave et al., 2012; Fasullo 
et al., 2013).
4.2.1.5 
Geodynamic Processes
Changing distributions of water mass between land, ice and ocean 
reservoirs cause nearly instantaneous changes in the Earth’s gravity 
ﬁeld and rotation, and elastic deformation of the solid Earth. These 
processes combine to produce spatially varying patterns of sea level 
change (Mitrovica et al., 2001; Mitrovica et al., 2011). For example, 
adjacent to an ice sheet losing mass, reduced gravitational attraction 
between the ice and nearby ocean causes RSL to fall, despite the rise 
in GMSL from the input of melt water to the ocean. The opposite 
effect is found far from the ice sheet, where RSL rise can be enhanced 
as much as 30% relative to the global average.
On time scales longer than the elastic Earth response, redistributions 
of water and ice cause time-dependent, visco-elastic deformation. This 
is observed in regions previously covered by ice during the Last Glacial 
Maximum (LGM), including much of Scandinavia and parts of North 
America (Lambeck et al., 1998; Peltier, 2004), where glacio-isostatic

adjustment (GIA) is causing uplift and a lowering of RSL that continues 
today. In other locations proximal to the previous ice load, and where 
a glacial forebulge once existed, the relaxing forebulge can contribute 
to a relative SLR, as currently being experienced along the coastline of 
the northeast United States. Water being syphoned to high latitudes 
as the peripheral bulges collapse leads to a widespread RSL fall in 
equatorial regions, while the overall loading of ocean crust by melt 
water can cause uplift of land areas near continental margins, far from 
the location of previous ice loading (Mitrovica and Milne, 2003; Milne 
and Mitrovica, 2008). Rates of modern VLM associated with these 
post-glacial processes are generally on the order of a few mm yr–1 
or less, but can exceed 1  cm yr–1 in some places. Because these 
gravity, rotation, and deformation (GRD) processes control spatial 
patterns of SLR from melting land ice, they need to be accounted for 
in regional-to-local sea level assessments. GRD processes are also 
important for marine-based ice sheets themselves, because they 
locally reduce RSL at retreating grounding lines which can slow and 
reduce retreat (Gomez et al., 2015; see 4.3.3.1.2 and Cross-chapter 
Box 8 in Chapter 3; Larour et al., 2019). 
VLM from tectonics and dynamic topography associated with viscous 
mantle processes also affect spatial patterns of relative sea level change. 
These geological processes are important for reconstructing ancient 
sea levels based on geological indicators (Austermann and Mitrovica, 
2015; see SM4.1). Along with other natural and anthropogenic 
processes including volcanism, compaction, and anthropogenic 
subsidence from ground water extraction (Section  4.2.2.4) these 
geodynamic processes can be locally important, producing rates of 
VLM comparable to or greater than recent climate-driven rates of 
GMSL change (Wöppelmann and Marcos, 2016). In this chapter, GIA 
and anthropogenic subsidence are used, and other components of VLM 
are ignored unless explicitly stated.
4.2.1.6 
Extreme Sea Level Events
Superimposed on gradual changes in RSL, as described in the previous 
sections, tides, storm surges, waves and other high-frequency 
processes (Figure 4.4) can be important. Understanding the localised 
impact of such processes requires detailed knowledge of bathymetry, 
erosion and sedimentation, as well as a good description of the 
temporal variability of the wind ﬁelds generating waves and storm 
surges. The potential for compounding effects, like storm surge 
and high SLR, are of particular concern as they can contribute 
signiﬁcantly to ﬂooding risks and extreme events (Little et al., 2015a). 
These processes can be captured by hydrodynamical models (see 
Section 4.2.3.4).
4.2.2 
Observed Changes in Sea Level  
(Past and Present)
Sea level changes in the distant geologic past provide information 
on the size of the ice sheets in climate states different from today. 
Past intervals with temperatures comparable to or warmer than 
today are of particular interest, and since AR5 (Masson-Delmotte 
et al., 2013) they have been increasingly used to test and calibrate 
process-based ice sheet models used in future projections (DeConto 
and Pollard, 2016; Edwards et al., 2019; Golledge et al., 2019). These 
intervals include the mPWP around 3.3–3.0 Ma, when atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations were similar to today (~300–450 ppmv; Badger 
et al., 2013; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015; Stap et al., 2016) and global

mean temperature was 2ºC–4ºC warmer than pre-industrial (Dutton 
et al., 2015a; Haywood et al., 2016) and the LIG around 129–116 ka, 
when global mean temperature was 0.5ºC–1.0ºC warmer (Capron 
et al., 2014; Dutton et al., 2015a; Fischer et al., 2018) and sea surface 
temperatures were similar to today (Hoffman et al., 2017). Updated 
reconstructions of GMSL (Dutton et al., 2015a) based on ancient 
shoreline elevations corrected to account for geodynamic processes 
(4.2.1.5), and geochemical records extracted from marine sediment 
cores, indicate sea levels were >5 m higher than today during these 
past warm periods (medium conﬁdence).
Most estimates of peak GMSL during the mPWP range between 6 
and 30 m higher than today (Miller et al., 2012; Rovere et al., 2014; 
Dutton et al., 2015a) but with deep uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5 
in Chapter 1) and few constraints on the high end of the range. The 
large uncertainty is contributed by uncertain GIA corrections applied 
to palaeo shoreline indicators (Raymo et al., 2011; Rovere et al., 2014), 
dynamic topography, the vertical land surface motion associated 
with Earth’s mantle ﬂow (Rowley et al., 2013), and possible biases 
in geochemical records of ice volume derived from marine sediments 
(Raymo et al., 2018). Estimates of GMSL >10 m higher than today 
require a meltwater contribution from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in 
addition to the GIS and West Antarctic Ice Sheets (WAIS; Miller et al., 
2012; Dutton et al., 2015a). Pliocene modelling studies appearing 
since AR5 (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013) demonstrate the potential 
for substantial retreat of East Antarctic ice into deep submarine 
basins (Austermann and Mitrovica, 2015; Pollard et al., 2015; Aitken 
et al., 2016; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Gasson et al., 2016; Golledge 
et al., 2019), as does emerging geological evidence from marine 
sediment cores recovered from the East Antarctic margin (Cook 
et al., 2013; Patterson et al., 2014; Bertram et al., 2018). However, 
the range of maximum Pliocene GMSL contributions from Antarctic 
modelling (Austermann and Mitrovica, 2015; Pollard et al., 2015; 
Yamane et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Gasson et al., 2016) 
remains large (5.4–17.8 m), providing little additional constraint on 
the geological estimates. Land surface exposure measurements on 
sediment sourced from East Antarctica (Shakun et al., 2018) suggests 
Pliocene ice loss was limited to marine-based ice, where the bedrock 
is below sea level and possibly prone to marine ice sheet instabilities 
(Cross-Chapter box 8 in Chapter 3). The total potential contribution 
to GMSL rise from marine-based ice in Antarctica is ~22.5 m (Fretwell 
et al., 2013). Combined with the complete loss of the GIS, this could 
conceivably produce ~30  m of GMSL rise. However, this would 
require maximum retreat of GIS and AIS to be synchronous, which is 
not probable due to orbitally paced, inter-hemispheric asymmetries 
in Greenland and Antarctic climate (de Boer et al., 2017). As such, 
25 m is found to be a reasonable upper bound on GMSL during the 
mPWP, but with low conﬁdence.
An updated estimate of maximum GMSL during the more geologically 
recent LIG ranges between 6–9 m higher than today (Dutton et al., 
2015a). This is close to the values reported by a probabilistic analysis of 
globally distributed sea level indicators (Kopp et al., 2009), but slightly 
higher than AR5’s central estimate of 6 m. Like the mid-Pliocene, the 
LIG estimates also suffer from uncertainties in GIA corrections and 
dynamic topography. Düsterhus et al. (2016) applied data assimilation 
techniques including GIA corrections to the same LIG dataset used 
by Kopp et al. (2009) and found good agreement (7.5 ± 1.1 m likely 
range) with Kopp et al. (2009) and Dutton et al. (2015a), but the 
upper range remains poorly constrained. Their estimates of peak LIG 
sea level are sensitive to the assumed ice history before and after the 
LIG, consistent with the results of other studies (Lambeck et al., 2012; 
Dendy et al., 2017). Austermann et al. (2017) compared a compilation 
of LIG shoreline indicators with dynamic topography simulations. 
They found that vertical surface motions driven by mantle convection 
can produce several metres of uncertainty in LIG sea level estimates, 
but their mean and most probable estimates of 6.7 m and 6.4 m are 
broadly in line with other estimates. 
Greenland and Antarctic climate change on these time scales is 
inﬂuenced by inter-hemispheric differences in polar ampliﬁcation 
(Stap et al., 2018), changes in Earth’s orbit, and long-term climate 
system processes. This complicates relationships between global 
mean temperature and ice sheet response. On Greenland, the 
magnitude of LIG summer warming and changes in ice sheet volume 
continue to be contested. Extreme summer warming of 6ºC or more, 
reconstructed from ice cores (Dahl-Jensen et al., 2013; Landais et al., 
2016; Yau et al., 2016) and lake archives (McFarlin et al., 2018) 
is in apparent conﬂict with a persistent, spatially extensive GIS 
reconstructed from ice cores and radar imaging (Dahl-Jensen et al., 
2013). Maximum retreat of the GIS during the LIG varies widely 
among modelling studies, ranging from ~1 m to ~6 m (Helsen et al., 
2013; Quiquet et al., 2013; Dutton et al., 2015a; Goelzer et al., 2016; 
Yau et al., 2016); however, the models consistently indicate a small 
Greenland contribution to GMSL early in the interglacial, implying 
Antarctica was the dominant contributor to the early interglacial 
highstand of 6 ± 1.5 m, beginning around 129 ka (Dutton et al., 
2015b). An early LIG loss of Antarctic ice is consistent with recent 
ice sheet modelling (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Goelzer et al., 
2016). Due to its bedrock conﬁguration and susceptibility to marine 
ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3), the WAIS 
would have been especially vulnerable to subsurface ocean warming 
during the LIG (Sutter et al., 2016). However, most evidence of WAIS 
retreat during the LIG remains indirect (Steig et al., 2015) and ﬁrm 
geological evidence has yet to be uncovered. A recent analysis of East 
Antarctic sediments provides evidence of some ice retreat in Wilkes 
subglacial basin during the LIG (Wilson and Forsyth, 2018), but the 
volume of ice loss is not quantiﬁed.
GMSL during the LIG was at times higher than today (virtually certain), 
with a likely range between 6–9 m, and not expected to be more 
than 10  m (medium conﬁdence). Due to ongoing uncertainties in 
the evolution of atmospheric and oceanic warming over and around 
the ice sheets, and low conﬁdence in the relative contributions of 
Antarctic versus Greenland meltwater to GMSL change, the LIG 
is not used here to directly assess the sensitivity of the ice sheets 
under current or future climate conditions. There is low conﬁdence 
in the utility of changes in either mPWP or LIG sea level changes to 
quantitatively inform near-term future rates of GMSL rise.
An expanded summary of recent advances and ongoing difﬁculties 
in reconstructing these time periods in terms of climate, sea level, 
and implications for the future evolution of ice sheets and sea level 
is provided in SM4.1.

4.2.2.1 
Global Mean Sea Level Changes During 
the Instrumental Period 
Observational estimates of the sea level variations over past 
millennia rely essentially on proxy-based regional relative sea 
level reconstructions corrected for GIA. Since AR5, the increasing 
availability of regional proxy-based reconstructions enables the 
estimation of GMSL change over the last ~3 kyr. The ﬁrst statistical 
integration of the available reconstructions shows that the GMSL 
experienced variations of ±9 [±7 to ±11] cm (5–95% uncertainty 
range; Kopp et al., 2016) over the 2400 years preceding the 20th 
century (medium conﬁdence). This is more tightly bound than the AR5 
assessment which indicated a variability in GMSL that was <±25 cm 
over the same period. This progress since AR5 conﬁrms that it is 
virtually certain that the mean rate of GMSL has increased during the 
last two centuries from relatively low rates of change during the late 
Holocene (order tenths of mm yr–1) to modern rates (order mm yr–1; 
Woodruff et al., 2013).
Over the last two centuries, sea level observations have mostly 
relied on tide gauge measurements. These records, beginning around 
1700 in some locations (Holgate et al., 2012; PSMSL, 2019), provide 
insight into historic sea level trends. Since 1992, the emergence of 
precise satellite altimetry has advanced our knowledge on GMSL and 
regional sea level changes considerably through a combination of 
near global ocean coverage and high spatial resolution. It has also 
enabled more detailed monitoring of land ice loss. Since 2002, high 
precision gravity measurements provided by the Gravity Recovery 
and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On missions 
show the loss of land ice in Greenland and Antarctica, and conﬁrm 
independent assessments of ice sheet mass changes based on 
satellite altimetry (Shepherd et al., 2012; The Imbie team, 2018) 
and InSAR measurements combined with ice sheet SMB estimates 
(Noël et al., 2018; Rignot et al., 2019). Since 2006, when the array 
of Argo proﬁling ﬂoats reached near-global coverage, it has been 
possible to get an accurate estimate of the ocean thermal expansion 
(down to 2000  m depth) and test the closure of the sea level 
budget. The combined analysis of the different observing systems 
that are available has improved signiﬁcantly the understanding of 
the magnitude and relative contributions of the different processes 
causing sea level change. In particular, important progress has been 
achieved since AR5 on estimating and understanding the increasing 
contribution of the ice sheets to SLR.
4.2.2.1.1 Tide gauge records
The number of tide gauges has increased over time from only a few in 
northern Europe in the 18th century to more than 2000 today along 
the world’s coastlines. Because of their location and limited number, 
tide gauges sample the ocean sparsely and non-uniformly with a bias 
towards the Northern Hemisphere. Most tide gauge records are short 
and have signiﬁcant gaps. In addition, tide gauges are anchored 
on land and are affected by the vertical motion of Earth’s crust 
caused by both natural processes (e.g., GIA, tectonics and sediment 
compaction; Wöppelmann and Marcos, 2016; Pfeffer et al., 2017) and 
anthropogenic activities (e.g., groundwater depletion, dam building 
or settling of landﬁll in urban areas; Raucoules et al., 2013; Pfeffer 
et al., 2017). When estimating the GMSL due to the ocean thermal 
expansion and land ice melt, tide gauges must be corrected for this 
VLM, where VLM = GIA + anthropogenic subsidence + (tectonics, 
natural subsidence). This is possible with stations of the Global 
Positioning System (GPS) network when they are co-located with 
tide gauges (Santamaría-Gómez et al., 2017; Kleinherenbrink et al., 
2018). However, this approach provides information on the VLM over 
the past two to three decades and has limited value over longer time 
scales for places where the VLM has varied signiﬁcantly through the 
last century (Riva et al., 2017). 
AR5 assessed the different strategies to estimate the 20th century 
GMSL changes. These strategies only accounted for the inhomogeneous 
space and time coverage of tide gauge data and for the VLM induced 
by GIA (Figure  4.5). Since AR5 two new approaches have been 
developed. The ﬁrst one uses a Kalman smoother which combines tide 
gauge records with the spatial patterns associated with ocean dynamic 
change, change in land ice and GIA. It enables accounting for the 
inhomogeneous distribution of tide gauges and the VLM associated 
with both GIA and current land ice loss (Hay et al., 2015; Figure 4.5). 
The second approach uses ad hoc corrections to tide gauge records 
with an additional spatial pattern associated with changes in terrestrial 
water storage to account for the inhomogeneous distribution in tide 
gauges. It also accounts for the total VLM (Dangendorf et al., 2017; 
Figure  4.5). Both methods yield signiﬁcantly lower GMSL changes 
over the period 1950–1970 than previous estimates, leading to 
long-term trends since 1900 that are smaller than previous estimates 
by 0.4 mm yr–1 (Figure 4.5). Different arguments including biases in 
the tide gauge datasets (Hamlington and Thompson, 2015), biases in 
the averaging technique and absence of VLM correction (Dangendorf 
et al., 2017), or in the spatial patterns associated with the sea level 
contributions (Hamlington et al., 2018) have been proposed to 
explain these smaller GMSL rates. There is no agreement yet on which 
is the primary reason for the differences and it is not clear whether 
all the reasons invoked can actually explain all the differences 
across reconstructions. As there is no clear evidence to discard any 
reconstruction, this assessment considers the ensemble of AR5 sea 
level reconstructions augmented by the two recent reconstructions 
from Hay et al. (2015) and Dangendorf et al. (2017) to evaluate the 
GMSL changes over the 20th century. On this basis, it is estimated 
that it is very likely that the long-term trend in GMSL estimated from 
tide gauge records is 1.5 (1.1–1.9) mm yr–1 between 1902 and 2010 
for a total SLR of 0.16 (0.12–0.21) m (see also Table 4.1) over this 
period. This estimate is consistent with the AR5 assessment (but with 
an increased uncertainty range) and conﬁrms that it is virtually certain 
that GMSL rates over the 20th century are several times as large as 
GMSL rates during the late Holocene (see 4.2.2.1). Over the 20th 
century the GMSL record also shows an acceleration (high conﬁdence) 
as now four out of ﬁve reconstructions extending back to at least 
1902 show a robust acceleration (Jevrejeva et al., 2008; Church and 
White, 2011; Ray and Douglas, 2011; Haigh et al., 2014b; Hay et al., 
2015; Watson, 2016; Dangendorf et al., 2017). The estimates of the 
acceleration ranges between -0.002–0.019 mm yr–1 over 1902–2010 
are consistent with AR5.

4.2.2.1.2 Satellite altimetry 
High precision satellite altimetry started in October 1992 with the 
launch of the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of spacecraft. Since 
then, 11 satellite altimeters have been launched providing nearly 
global sea level measurements (up to ±82ºlatitude) over more 
than 25 years. Six groups (AVISO/CNES, SL_cci/ESA, University of 
Colorado, CSIRO, NASA/GSFC, NOAA; Nerem et al., 2010; Henry 
et al., 2014; Leuliette, 2015; Watson et al., 2015; Beckley et al., 2017; 
Legeais et al., 2018) provide altimetry-based GMSL time series. Since 
AR5, several studies using two independent approaches based on 
tide gauge records (Watson et al., 2015) and the sea level budget 
closure (Chen et al., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017) identiﬁed a drift of 
1.5 (0.4–3.4) mm yr–1 in TOPEX A from January 1993 to February 
1999. Accounting for this drift leads to a revised GMSL rate from 
satellite altimetry of 3.16 (2.79–3.53) for 1993–2015 (WCRP 
Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018; see Table 4.1) compared to 
3.3  mm yr–1 (2.7–3.9) for 1993–2010 in AR5. Compared to AR5, 
the revised satellite altimetry GMSL estimates now show with high 
conﬁdence an acceleration of 0.084 (0.059–0.090) mm yr–1 over 
1993–2015 (5–95% uncertainty range; Watson et al., 2015; Nerem 
et al., 2018). This acceleration is due to an increase in Greenland 
mass loss since the 2000s (Chen et al., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017) and 
a slight increase in all other contributions probably partly due to 
the recovery from the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991 (Fasullo 
et al., 2016) and partly due to increased GHG concentrations 
e.g., (Slangen et al., 2016; high conﬁdence). The current sea level 
rise is 3.6 ± 0.3 mm yr–1 over 2006–2015 (90% conﬁdence level). 
This is the highest rate measured by satellite altimetry (Ablain et al., 
2019; medium conﬁdence). Before the satellite altimetry era, the 
highest rate of sea level rise recorded was reached during the period 
1935–1944. It amounted 2.5 ± 0.7 mm yr–1 (estimate at the 90% 
conﬁdence level from sea level reconstructions; Church and White, 
2011; Ray and Douglas, 2011; Jevrejeva et al., 2008; Hay et al., 2015; 
Dangendorf et al., 2017). This is expected to be smaller than the 
current rate of sea level rise, making the current sea level rise the 
highest on instrumental record (medium conﬁdence).
4.2.2.2 
Contributions to Global Mean Sea Level Change 
During the Instrumental Period
The different contributions to the GMSL rise are independently 
observed over various time scales. They are compared with simulated 
estimates from climate model experiments of CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 
2012) when available (see Table 4.1). The observations are compared 
with experiments beginning in the mid-19th century, forced with 
past time-dependent anthropogenic changes in atmospheric 
composition, natural forcings due to volcanic aerosols and variations 
in solar irradiance (Taylor et al., 2012). The objective is ﬁrst, to assess 
understanding of the causes of observed sea level changes and 
second, to evaluate the ability of coupled climate models to simulate 
these causes. It enables the evaluation of the conﬁdence level there 
is in current coupled climate models that form the basis of future sea 
level projections. 
4.2.2.2.1 Thermal expansion contribution
The ocean thermal expansion is caused by excess heat being 
absorbed by the ocean, as the climate warms. Thermal expansion is 
estimated from in situ ocean observations and ocean heat content 
reanalyses that rely on assimilation of data into numerical models 
(Storto et al., 2017; Sections 1.8.1.1 and 1.8.1.4; WCRP Global Sea 
Level Budget Group, 2018). Full-depth, high-quality and unbiased 
ocean temperature proﬁle data with adequate metadata and 
spatio-temporal coverage are required to estimate thermal expansion 
and to understand drivers of variability and long-term change (Pfeffer 
et al., 2018; Section 5.2.2.2.2).
Historically, however, observational gaps exist and some ocean 
regions remain under-sampled to date (Sections 1.8.1.1 and 
5.2.2.2.2; Figure 1.3; Appendix 1.A, Figure 1.1). Other factors also 
introduce uncertainty in estimates of thermal expansion like changes 
in instrumentation, systematic instrumental errors, changes in 
the quality control of the data and the mapping method used to 
produce regular grids (Section 5.2.2.2.2; Palmer et al., 2010). In the 
upper 700 m, the largest sources of uncertainty for estimates of 
global mean thermal expansion from 1970 to 2004 are the choice 
of mapping methods (Boyer et al., 2016), followed by the choice 
of bias correction for the bathythermographic observations (Cheng 
et al., 2016; Section 5.2.2.2.2). From 2006 onwards, the uncertainty 
is considerably reduced (Roemmich et al., 2015; von Schuckmann 
et al., 2016; Wijffels et al., 2016), because the Argo array reached 
its targeted near-global (up to ±60ºlatitude) coverage for the upper 
2000 m in November 2007 (Riser et al., 2016; Section 5.2.2.2.2).
Since AR5, in a community effort, the (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget 
Group, 2018) revisited the global mean thermal expansion estimates 
based on observations only. On the basis of a full-depth 13-member 
ensemble of global mean thermal expansion time series developed 
with the latest data and corrections available, they estimated that 
the global thermal expansion was 1.40 (1.08–1.72) mm yr–1 for 
2006–2015, 1.36 (0.96–1.76) mm yr–1 for 1993–2015 (see Table 4.1). 
While the relative contribution of the upper 300 m did not change 
(~70%) between 2006–2015 and 1993–2015, the 700–2000  m 
contribution increased around 10% over the Argo decade (2006–
2015), when observations for that depth interval soared (Figure 1.3; 
Appendix 1.A, Figure 1.1). This suggests that observed changes for 
700–2000 m may have been underestimated for 1993–2005. Before 
1993, estimates are based on a smaller ensemble of 4 datasets in 
which no thermal expansion is assumed below 2000 m because of 
lack of data (see Section 5.2.2.2.2 for more details). This ensemble 
shows a thermal expansion linear rate of 0.89 (0.84–0.94) mm yr–1 
for 1970–2015 (see Table 4.1).
Coupled climate models simulate the historical thermal expansion 
(see Table 4.1). However, for models that omit the volcanic forcing 
in their control experiment, the imposition of the historical volcanic 
forcing during the 20th century results in a spurious time mean 
negative forcing and a spurious persistent ocean cooling related to 
the control climate (Gregory, 2010; Gregory et al., 2013). Since AR5, 
the magnitude of this effect has been estimated from historical

simulations forced by only natural radiative forcing. Then it has been 
used to correct the historical simulations forced with the full 20th 
century forcing (Slangen et al., 2016; Slangen et al., 2017b). The 
resulting ensemble mean of simulated thermal expansion provides 
a good ﬁt to the observations within the uncertainty ranges of both 
models and observations (Slangen et al., 2017b; Cheng et al., 2019; 
Table  4.1). The spread, which is essentially due to uncertainty in 
radiative forcing and uncertainty in the modelled climate sensitivity 
and ocean heat uptake efﬁciency (Melet and Meyssignac, 2015), is 
still larger than the observational uncertainties (Gleckler et al., 2016; 
Cheng et al., 2017; Table 4.1). Compared to AR5, the availability of 
improved observed and modelled estimates of thermal expansion and 
the good agreement between both conﬁrm the high conﬁdence level 
in the simulated thermal expansion using climate models and the high 
conﬁdence level in their ability to project future thermal expansion.
4.2.2.2.2 Ocean mass observations from GRACE  
and GRACE Follow-On
The ocean mass changes correspond to the sum of land ice and 
terrestrial water storage changes. Since 2002, the GRACE and 
GRACE follow-on missions provide direct estimates of the ocean 
mass changes and thus they provide an independent estimate of 
the sum of land ice and terrestrial water storage contributions to 
sea level. Since AR5, GRACE-based estimates of the ocean mass 
rates are increasingly consistent (WCRP Global Sea Level Budget 
Group, 2018) because of the extended length of GRACE missions’ 
observations (over 15 years), the improved understanding of data 
and methods for addressing GRACE limitations (e.g., noise ﬁltering, 
leakage correction and low-degree spherical harmonics estimates), 
and the improved knowledge of geophysical corrections applied 
to GRACE data (e.g., GIA). The most recent estimates (Dieng et al., 
2015b; Reager et al., 2016; Rietbroek et al., 2016; Chambers et al., 
2017; Blazquez et al., 2018; Uebbing et al., 2019) report a global 
ocean mass increase of 1.7 (1.4–2.0) mm yr–1 over 2003–2015 (see 
also Table  4.1). The uncertainty arises essentially from differences 
in the inversion method to compute the ocean mass (Chen et al., 
2013; Jensen et al., 2013; Johnson and Chambers, 2013; Rietbroek 
et al., 2016), uncertainties in the geocentre motion and uncertainty 
in the GIA correction (Blazquez et al., 2018; Uebbing et al., 2019). The 
consistency between estimates of the global mean ocean mass on a 
monthly time scale has also increased since AR5.
4.2.2.2.3 Glaciers
To assess the mass contribution of glaciers to sea level change, global 
estimates are required. Recent updates and temporal extensions of 
estimates obtained by different methods continue to provide very 
high conﬁdence in continuing glacier mass loss on the global scale 
during the past decade (Bamber et al., 2018; Wouters et al., 2019; 
Zemp et al., 2019), see Section 2.2.3 and Appendix 2.A for a detailed 
discussion also on regional scales). Updates of the reconstructions 
of Cogley (2009), Leclercq et al. (2011) and Marzeion et al. (2012), 
presented and compared in Marzeion et al. (2015), show increased 
agreement on rates of mass loss during the entire 20th century 
(Marzeion et al., 2015), compared to earlier estimates reported by 
AR5. The contribution of glaciers that may be missing in inventories 
or have already melted during the 20th century is hard to constrain 
(Parkes and Marzeion, 2018), and there is low conﬁdence in their 
estimated contribution. These glaciers are thus neglected in the 
assessment of the sea level budget (Table 4.1).
While the agreement between the observational estimates of glacier 
mass changes and the modelled estimates from glacier models 
forced with climate model simulations has increased since AR5 
(Slangen et al., 2017b), there is only medium conﬁdence in the use of 
glacier models to reconstruct sea level change because of the limited 
number of well-observed glaciers available to evaluate models on 
long time scales, and because of the small number of model-based 
global glacier reconstructions.
4.2.2.2.4 Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
Frequent observations of ice sheet mass changes have only been 
available since the advent of space observations (see Section 3.3.1). 
In the pre-satellite era, mass balance was geodetically reconstructed 
only for the GIS (Kjeldsen et al., 2015). These geodetic reconstructions 
empirically constrain the contribution of the GIS to SLR between 
1900 and 1983 to 17.2 (10.7–23.2; Kjeldsen et al., 2015). During the 
satellite era, three approaches have been developed to estimate ice 
sheet mass balance: 1) Mass loss is estimated by direct measurements 
of ice sheet height changes with satellite laser or radar altimetry in 
combination with climatological/glaciological models for ﬁrn density 
and compaction, 2) the input–output method combines measurements 
of ice ﬂow velocities estimated from satellite (synthetic aperture 
radar or optical imagery) across key outlets with estimates of net 
surface balance derived from ice thickness data, 3) space gravimetry 
data yields direct estimate of the mass changes by inversion of the 
anomalies in the gravity ﬁeld (see Section 3.3.1 for more details). AR5 
concluded that the three space-based methods give consistent results. 
They agree in showing that the rate of SLR due to the GIS and AIS’ 
contributions has increased since the early 1990s. Since AR5, up-to-
date observations conﬁrm this statement with increased conﬁdence 
for both ice sheets (Rignot et al., 2019; see Section  3.3.1). The 
assessment of the literature since AR5 made in Section 3.3.1 shows 
that the contribution from Greenland to SLR over 2012–2016 (0.68 
(0.64–0.72) mm yr–1) was similar to the contribution over 2002–2011 
(0.73 (0.67–0.79) mm yr–1) and extremely likely greater than over 1992–
2001 (0.02 (0.21–0.25) mm yr–1). The contribution from Antarctica over 
2012–2016 (0.55 (0.48–0.62) mm yr–1) was extremely likely greater 
than over the 2002–2011 period (0.23 (0.16–0.30) mm yr–1) and 
likely greater than over the period 1992–2001 (0.14 (0.12–0.16); see 
Section 3.3.1 for more details). 
Here, the approach of Section  3.3.1 is followed, using the two 
multi-method assessments from Bamber et al. (2018) and the  IMBIE 
team (2018) to evaluate the contribution of ice sheet mass loss to 
SLR over 1993–2015 and 2006–2015 (see Table  4.1). These two 
studies agree with results from the WCRP Global Sea Level Budget 
Group (2018). For the estimation of the AIS contribution, Bamber 
et al. (2018) and the The IMBIE team (2018) use similar but not 
identical data sources and processing. Both studies ﬁnd consistent 
results within uncertainties over both periods. In Table 4.1, the results 
of these two studies were averaged, and weighted the average on 
338

the basis of their uncertainties, because there is no apparent reason 
to discount either study. For the estimation of the GIS contribution 
only the Bamber et al. (2018) estimate is used, as there is no other 
multi-method assessment available.
4.2.2.2.5 Contributions from water storage on land
Water is stored on land not only in the form of ice but snow, surface 
water, soil moisture and groundwater. Temporal changes in land 
water storage, deﬁned as all forms of water stored on land excluding 
land ice, contribute to observed changes in ocean mass and thus sea 
level on annual to centennial time scales (Döll et al., 2016; Reager 
et al., 2016; Hamlington et al., 2017; Wada et al., 2017). They are 
caused by both climate variability and direct human interventions, 
at the multi-decadal to centennial time scales. Over the past century, 
the main cause for land water storage changes are the groundwater 
depletion and impoundment of water behind dams in reservoirs 
(Döll et al., 2016; Wada et al., 2016). While the rate of groundwater 
depletion and thus its contribution to SLR increased during the 20th 
century and up to today (Wada et al., 2016), its effect on sea level 
was more than balanced by the increase in land water storage due to 
dam construction between 1950 and 2000 (Wada et al., 2016). Since 
about 2000, based on hydrological models, the combined effect of 
both processes is a positive contribution to SLR (Wada et al., 2016). 
Decreased water storage in lakes, wetlands and soils due to human 
activities are less important for ocean mass changes (Wada et al., 
2016). Overall, the integrated effects of the direct human intervention 
on land hydrology have reduced land water storage during the last 
decade, increasing the rate of SLR by 0.15–0.24  mm yr–1 (Wada 
et al., 2016; Wada et al., 2017; Scanlon et al., 2018; WCRP Global 
Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). Over periods of a few decades, 
land water storage was affected signiﬁcantly by climate variability 
(Dieng et al., 2015a; Reager et al., 2016; Dieng et al., 2017). Net 
land water storage change driven by both climate and direct human 
interventions can be determined based on GRACE observations and 
global hydrological modelling. They indicate different estimates of 
the rate of SLR. Over the period 2002–2014 GRACE-based estimates 
of the net land water storage (i.e., not including glaciers) show a 
negative contribution to sea level (e.g., Scanlon et al., 2018) resulting 
in the negative value after 2006 in Table 1while hydrological models 
determined a slightly positive one. The reasons for this difference 
between estimates are not elucidated. There is scientiﬁc consensus 
that uncertainties of both net land water storage contribution to sea 
level and its individual contributions remain high (WCRP Global Sea 
Level Budget Group, 2018). The differences in estimates and the lack 
of multiple consistent studies give low conﬁdence in the net land 
water storage contribution to current SLR.
4.2.2.2.6 Budget of global mean sea level change
Drawing on previous sections, the budget of GMSL rise (Table 4.1, 
Figure 4.5) is assessed with observations over 4 periods: 1901–1990 
(which corresponds to the period in the 20th century that is prior 
to the increase in ice sheet contributions to GMSL rise), 1970–2015 
(when ocean observations are sufﬁciently accurate to estimate the 
global ocean thermal expansion and when glacier mass balance 
reconstructions start), 1993–2015 (when precise satellite altimetry is 
available) and 2006–2015 (when GRACE data is available in addition 
to satellite altimetry and when the Argo network reaches a near-global 
coverage). The budget of GMSL rise is also assessed with sea level 
contributions simulated by climate models over the same periods 
(Table 4.1, Figure 4.5). The periods 1993–2015 and 2006–2015 are 
only 23 and 10 years long respectively, short enough so that they can 
be affected by internal climate variability. Therefore, it is not expected 
that observations over these periods will be precisely reproduced by 
climate model historical experiments. For the contribution from land 
water storage, the estimated effect of direct human intervention 
was used, neglecting climate-related variations until 2002 (Ngo-Duc 
et al., 2005). From 2002 to 2015, total land water storage estimated 
with GRACE was used. In general, historical simulations of climate 
models end in 2005. Historical simulations were extended here to 
2015 using the RCP8.5 scenario. This choice of RCP scenario is not 
critical for the simulated sea level, as the different scenarios only 
start to diverge signiﬁcantly after the year 2030 (Church et al., 2013).
For 1993–2015 and 2006–2015, the observed GMSL rise is consistent 
within uncertainties with the sum of the estimated observed 
contributions (Table 4.1). Over the period 1993–2015 the two largest 
terms are the ocean thermal expansion (accounting for 43% of the 
observed GMSL rise) and the glacier mass loss (accounting for a further 
20%). Compared to AR5, the extended observations corrected for the 
TOPEX-A drift (see Section  4.2.2.1.2) allow us now to identify an 
acceleration in the observed SLR over 1993–2015 and to attribute this 
acceleration mainly to Greenland ice loss along with an acceleration in 
Antarctic ice loss (Velicogna et al., 2014; Harig and Simons, 2015; Chen 
et al., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017; Yi et al., 2017; see also Sections 4.2.2.2.2, 
4.2.2.3.4, 3.3.1). Since 2006, land ice, collectively from glaciers and 
the ice sheets has become the most important contributor to GMSL 
rise over the thermal expansion with mountain glaciers contributing 
20% and ice sheets 33% (see Table 4.1). Over the periods 1993–2015, 
the sum of the observed sea level contributions is consistent with the 
total observed sea level within uncertainties at monthly-scales (not 
shown, e.g., Dieng et al., 2017). This is also true for the period 2006–
2015, when uncertainties are signiﬁcantly smaller. This agreement 
at monthly time scales represents a signiﬁcant advance since the 
AR5 in physical understanding of the causes of past GMSL change. 
It provides an improved basis for the evaluation of models. Given 
these elements there is high conﬁdence that the current observing 
system is capable of resolving decadal to multidecadal changes 
in GMSL and its components (with an uncertainty of <0.7 mm yr–1 
at decadal and longer time scales, see Table 4.1 and for example, 
WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 2018). However, despite this 
advance since AR5 there are still no comprehensive observations of 
ocean thermal expansion below 2000 m, in regions covered by sea ice 
and in marginal seas. The understanding of glacier mass loss can be 
improved at regional scale and the understanding of the land water 
storage contribution is still limited. Thus, for smaller changes in sea 
level of the order of a few tenths of a mm yr–1 at decadal time scales 
and shorter time scales there is medium conﬁdence in the capability of 
the current observing system to resolve them (e.g., WCRP Global Sea 
Level Budget Group, 2018).
Before 1992, observations are not sufﬁcient to conﬁdently estimate 
the ice sheet mass balance and before 1970, the space and time

sampling of ocean observations are not sufﬁcient to estimate the 
global ocean thermal expansion. For these reasons, it is difﬁcult to 
assess the closure of the GMSL rise budget over 1901–1990 and 
1970–2015 (Church et al., 2013; Gregory et al., 2013; Jevrejeva et al., 
2017; Meyssignac et al., 2017c; Slangen et al., 2017b; Parkes and 
Marzeion, 2018). For the period 1970–2015, the thermal expansion 
of the ocean represents 43% of the observed GMSL rise while the 
glaciers’ contribution represents 22% (see Table  4.1). This result 
indicates a slightly smaller contribution from glaciers than reported 
by AR5. If the GIS contribution and the Antarctic SMB is added, then 
the sum of the contributors to sea level is in agreement with the 
low end observed SLR estimates over 1970–2015 (Frederikse et al., 
2018). This result suggests that the contribution of Antarctica ice 
sheet dynamics to SLR has been small, if any, before the 1990s.
Since AR5, extended simulations along with recent ﬁndings in 
observations and improved model estimates allow for a new more 
robust, consistent and comprehensive comparison between sea level 
estimates based on observations and climate model simulations 
(e.g.,  Meyssignac et al., 2017c; Slangen et al., 2017b; Parkes and 
Marzeion, 2018). Compared to AR5, the simulated thermal expansion 
from climate models has improved with a new correction for the 
volcanic activity (see Section 4.2.2.2.1). The glacier contribution from 
glacier models forced with inputs from climate models is updated 
with a new glacier inventory and improvements to the glacier mass 
balance model (Marzeion et al., 2015). The simulated Greenland 
SMB is estimated with a new regional SMB-component downscaling 
technique, which accounts for the regional variations in components 
of the Greenland SMB (Noël et al., 2015; Meyssignac et al., 2017a). 
In addition, an updated groundwater extraction contribution from 
Döll et al. (2014) is now used for the land water storage contribution. 
For the periods 1970–2015, 1993–2015 and 2006–2015 the 
simulated contributions from thermal expansion, glaciers mass loss 
and Greenland SMB explain respectively 84%, 81% and 77% of the 
observed GMSL (see Table 4.1). For all these periods the residual is 
consistent within uncertainty with the sum of the contribution from 
land water storage and ice discharge from Greenland and Antarctica. 
For each period the consistency is improved compared to AR5 (see 
Table 4.1) although the uncertainty on the residual is slightly larger 
because of a larger uncertainty in simulated Glaciers and Greenland 
SMB contributions. 
For the period 1901–1990 the simulated contributions from thermal 
expansion, glaciers mass loss and Greenland SMB explain only 60% 
of the observed GMSL and the residual is too large to be explained 
by the sum of the contribution from land water storage and ice 
discharge from Greenland and Antarctica. The gap can be explained 
by a bias in the simulated Greenland SMB and glacier ice loss around 
Greenland in the early 20th century (Slangen et al., 2017b). When 
the glacier model and the Greenland SMB downscaling technique 
are forced with observed climate from atmospheric reanalyses, rather 
than the simulated climate from coupled climate models, simulated 
SLR becomes consistent with the observed SLR (see the dashed blue

line on Figure 4.5). This is because atmospheric reanalyses show an 
increase in air temperatures in and around Greenland over the period 
1900–1940, which lead to increased melt in Greenland (Bjørk et al., 
2012; Fettweis et al., 2017) and surrounding glaciers in the ﬁrst half 
of the 20th century. This increase in air temperature over 1900–1940 
is not reproduced by climate models (Slangen et al., 2017b). It may 
be because this increase in air temperature was due to internal 
climate variability on temporal and spatial scales that cannot be 
precisely reproduced by climate models. It may also be due to a bias 
in atmospheric circulation in climate models (Fettweis et al., 2017), 
or an issue with the spatial pattern of the historical aerosol forcing.
In summary, the agreement between climate model simulations 
and observations of the global thermal expansion, glacier mass loss 
and Greenland SMB has improved compared to AR5 for periods 
starting after 1970. However, for periods prior to 1970, signiﬁcant 
discrepancies between climate models and observations arise 
from the inability of climate models to reproduce some observed 
regional changes in glacier and GIS SMB around the southern tip of 
Greenland. It is not clear whether this bias in climate models is due to 
the internal variability of the climate system or deﬁciencies in climate 
models. For this reason, there is still medium conﬁdence in the ability 
of climate models to simulate past and future changes in glaciers 
mass loss and Greenland SMB. 
4.2.2.3 
Regional Sea Level Changes During  
the Instrumental Period
Sea level does not rise uniformly. Observations from tide gauges 
and satellite altimetry (Figure  4.6) indicate that sea level shows 
substantial regional variability at decadal to multi-decadal time 
scales (e.g.,  Carson et al., 2017; Hamlington et al., 2018). These 
regional changes are essentially due to changing winds, air-sea heat 
and freshwater ﬂuxes, atmospheric pressure loading and the addition 
of melting ice into the ocean, which alters the ocean circulation 
(Stammer et al., 2013; Forget and Ponte, 2015; Meyssignac et al., 
2017b). The addition of water into the ocean also change the geoid, 
alter the rotation of the Earth and deform the ocean ﬂoor which in 
turn change sea level (e.g., Tamisiea, 2011; Stammer et al., 2013). 
Sea level is rising in all ocean basins (virtually certain; Legeais et al. 
2018). Part of this regional sea level rise is due to global sea level rise 
of which a majority is attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions (high conﬁdence; Slangen et al. 2016). The remaining part 
of the regional sea-level rise in ocean basins is a combination of the 
response to anthropogenic GHG emissions and internal variability 
(e.g., Stammer et al. 2013; medium conﬁdence).
In the open ocean, the spatial variability and trends in sea level 
observed during the recent altimetry era or reconstructed over the 
previous decades are dominated by the thermal expansion of the 
ocean. In shallow shelf seas and at high latitudes (>60ºN and <55ºS), 
the effect of dynamic mass redistribution becomes important. At 
local scale, salinity changes can also generate sizeable changes in the 
ocean density similar to thermal expansion and lead to signiﬁcant 
variability in sea level (Forget and Ponte, 2015; Meyssignac et al., 
2017b). On global average, the heat and freshwater ﬂuxes from the 
atmosphere into the ocean are responsible for the total heat that 
enters the ocean and for the associated GMSL rise. At regional scale 
and local scale, both the ocean transport divergences caused by wind 
stress anomalies and the spatial variability in atmospheric heat ﬂuxes 
are responsible for the spatial variability in thermal expansion and 
thus for most of the regional sea level departures around the GMSL 
rise (e.g., Stammer et al., 2013; Forget and Ponte, 2015).
Over the Paciﬁc, the surface wind anomalies responsible for the 
sea level spatio-temporal variability are associated with the ENSO, 
Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and North Paciﬁc Gyre Oscillation 
modes (Hamlington et al., 2013; Moon et al., 2013; Palanisamy et al., 
2015; Han et al., 2017). In the Indian Ocean they are associated with 
the ENSO and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) modes (Nidheesh et al., 
2013; Han et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2016; Han et al., 2017). In 
particular, the PDO is responsible for most of the intensiﬁed SLR that 
has been observed in the western tropical Paciﬁc Ocean since the 
1990s (Moon et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014; Thompson and Mitchum, 
2014). Several studies suggested that in addition to the PDO signal, 
warming of the tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans enhanced surface 
easterly trade winds and thus also contributes to the intensiﬁed SLR 
in the western tropical Paciﬁc (England et al., 2014; Hamlington et al., 
2014; McGregor et al., 2014).
Over the Atlantic, the regional sea level variability at interannual to 
multi-decadal time scales, is generated by surface wind anomalies 
and heat ﬂuxes associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; 
Han et al., 2017) and also by ocean heat transport due to changes 
in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC; McCarthy 
et al., 2015). Both mechanisms are not independent as heat ﬂuxes 
and wind stress anomalies associated with NAO can induce changes 
in the AMOC (Schloesser et al., 2014; Yeager and Danabasoglu, 
2014). In the Southern Ocean, the sea level variability is dominated 
by the SAM inﬂuence in particular in the Indian and Paciﬁc sectors. 
The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) inﬂuence becomes weaker 
equator-wards in these sectors while the inﬂuence of PDO, ENSO and 
IOD increases (Frankcombe et al., 2015). In the southern ocean, the 
zonal asymmetry in westerly winds associated to the SAM, generates 
convergent and divergent transport in the Antarctic Circumpolar 
Current which may have contributed to the regional asymmetry of 
decadal sea level variations during most of the twentieth century 
(Thompson and Mitchum, 2014).
As for GMSL, net regional sea level changes can be estimated from 
a combination of the various contributions to sea level change. The 
contributions from dynamic sea level, atmospheric loading, glacier 
mass changes and ice sheet SMB can be derived from CMIP5 climate 
model outputs either directly or through downscaling techniques 
(Perrette et al., 2013; Kopp et al., 2014; Slangen et al., 2014a; 
Bilbao et al., 2015; Carson et al., 2016; Meyssignac et al., 2017a). 
The contributions from groundwater depletion, reservoir storage 
and dynamic ice sheet mass changes are not simulated by coupled 
climate models over the 20th century and have to be estimated 
from observations. The sum of all contributions, including the GIA 
contribution, provides a modelled estimate of the 20th century net 
regional sea level changes that can be compared with observations 
from satellite altimetry and tide-gauge records (see Figure 4.6).

In terms of interannual to multi-decadal variability, there is a 
general agreement between the simulated regional sea level and 
tide gauge records, over the period 1900–2015 (see inset ﬁgures in 
Figure 4.6). The relatively large, short-term oscillations in observed 
sea level (black lines in insets in Figure 4.6), which are due to the 
natural internal climate variability, are included in general within the 
modelled internal variability of the climate system represented by 
the blue shaded area (5–95% uncertainty). But, as for GMSL, climate 
models tend to systematically underestimate the observed sea level 
trends from tide gauge records, particularly in the ﬁrst half of the 
20th century. This underestimation is explained by a bias identiﬁed in 
modelled Greenland SMB, and glacier ice loss around Greenland in the 
early 20th century (see Section 4.2.2.2.6; Slangen et al., 2017b). The 
correction of this bias improves the agreement between the spatial 
variability in sea level trends from observations and from climate 
models (see Figure  4.6). Climate models indicate that the spatial 
variability in sea level trends observed by tide-gauge records over the 
20th century is dominated by the GIA contribution and the thermal 
expansion contribution over 1900–2015. Locally all contributions 
to sea level changes are important as any contribution can cause 
signiﬁcant local deviations. Around India for example, groundwater 
depletion is responsible for the low 20th century SLR (because the 
removal of groundwater mass generated a local decrease in geoid 
that made local SLR slower; Meyssignac et al., 2017c).
These results show the ability of models to reproduce the major 20th 
century regional sea level changes due to GIA, thermal expansion, 
glacier mass loss and ice sheet SMB. This is tangible progress since 
AR5. But some doubts remain regarding the ability of climate models 
to reproduce local variations such as the glaciers and the Greenland 
SMB contributions to sea level in the region around the southern 
tip of Greenland (Slangen et al., 2017b) or such as the thermal 
expansion in some eddy active regions (Sérazin et al., 2016). Because 
of these doubts there is still medium conﬁdence in climate models 
to project future regional sea level changes associated with thermal 
expansion, glacier mass loss and ice sheet SMB. Coupled climate 
models have not simulated the other contributions to 20th century 
sea level, including the growing ice sheet dynamical contribution and 
land water storage changes.

climate variability. For Mediterranean tide gauges, that is, Venice and Alexandria, the local simulated sea level has been computed with the simulated sea level in the 
Atlantic ocean at the entrance of the strait of Gibraltar following (Adloff et al., 2018). Tide gauge records have been corrected for vertical land motion (VLM) not associated 
with GIA where available, that is, for New York, Balboa and Lusi. Updated from Meyssignac et al. (2017b) to mimic RSL as good as possible.

4.2.2.4 
Local Coastal Sea Level
Since the local coastal sea level (scale ~10 km) is affected by global, 
regional (scale ~100 km) and coastal scale features and processes like 
anthropogenic subsidence, it may differ substantially from the regional 
sea level. At the coast, the sea level change is additionally affected 
by wave run up, tidal level, wind forcing, sea level pressure (SLP), the 
dominant modes of climate variability, seasonal climatic periodicities, 
mesoscale eddies, changes in river ﬂow, as well as anthropogenic 
subsidence (see also Box 4.1). These local contributions, combined 
with sea level events generated by storm surges and tides result in 
anomalous conditions (ESL) which last for a short time in contrast 
to the gradual increase over time from for instance ice mass loss. 
Flood risk due to ESL is exacerbated due to its interaction with RSL 
and hence physical vulnerability assessments combine uncertainties 
around ESL and RSL, both in terms of contemporary assessments and 
future projections (Little et al., 2015b; Vousdoukas, 2016; Vousdoukas 
et al., 2016; Wahl et al., 2017). Changes in mean sea level have been 
dealt with in previous sections (e.g.,  Section  4.2.2.2.6). Here the 
focus is on some of the components of ESL that have been assessed 
in combination with changes in RSL. Church et al. (2013) concluded 
that change in sea level extremes is very likely to be caused by a 
RSL increase, and that storminess and surges will contribute towards 
these extremes; however, it was noted that there was low conﬁdence 
in region-speciﬁc projections as there was only a limited number of 
studies with a poor geographical coverage available.
Recent advances in statistical and dynamical modelling of wave 
effects at the coast, storm surges and inundation risk have reduced 
the uncertainties around the inundation risks at the coast (Vousdoukas 
et al., 2016; Vitousek et al., 2017; Melet et al., 2018; Vousdoukas et al., 
2018c) and assessments of the resulting highly resolved coastal sea 
levels are now emerging (Cid et al., 2017; Muis et al., 2017; Wahl 
et al., 2017). This progress was facilitated due to the availability 
of, for example, the Global Extreme Sea Level Analysis (GESLA-2; 
Woodworth et al., 2016) high-frequency (hourly) datasets, advances 
in the Coordinated Ocean Wave Climate Project (COWCLIP; Hemer 
et al., 2013), coastal altimetry datasets (Cipollini et al., 2017), and 
the Global Tide and Surge Reanalysis (GTSR; Muis et al., 2016), while 
new analyses of datasets that have been available since before the 
publication of AR5 have continued (e.g., PSML; Holgate et al., 2012).
Although ESL is experienced episodically by deﬁnition, Marcos et al. 
(2015) examined the long-term behaviour of storm surge models and 
detected decadal and multidecadal variations in storm surge that are 
not related to changes in RSL. They found that, although 82% of their 
observed time series showed synchronous patterns at regional scales, 
the pattern tended to be non-linear, implying that it would be difﬁcult 
to infer future behaviour unless the physical basis for the responses 
was understood. An analysis of the relative contributions of SLR and 
ESL due to storminess showed that in the US Paciﬁc northwest since 
the early 1980s, increases in wave height and period have had a larger 
effect on coastal ﬂooding and erosion than RSL (Ruggiero, 2012) 
since the early 1980s. This is also true in other regions distributed 
over the entire globe (Melet et al., 2016; Melet et al., 2018). Changes 
since 1990 in the sea level harmonics and seasonal phases and 
amplitudes of the wave period and signiﬁcant wave height were 
found for the Gulf of Mexico coast and along the US east coast (Wahl 
et al., 2014; Wahl and Plant, 2015). These authors found that high 
waters have increased twice as much as one would expect from 
long-term SLR alone, because of additional changes in the seasonal 
cycle, yielding a 30% increase in risk of ﬂooding. Such effects are 
likely to be highly dependent on the local conditions. For example, 
using WAVEWATCH III, TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry tide model data 
and atmospheric forcing physically downscaled using Delft3D-WAVE 
and Delft3D-FLOW in what they call the Coastal Storm Modeling 
System (CoSMoS), Vitousek et al. (2017) were able to detect local 
inundation hazards (at a scale of hundreds of metres) across regions 
along the Californian coast. Similarly, Castrucci and Tahvildari (2018) 
simulated the impact of SLR along the Mid-Atlantic region in the 
USA. A study for the Maldives shows that the contribution of wave 
setup is essential to estimate ﬂood risks (Wadey et al., 2017).
In deltas, the local sea level can be dominated by anthropogenic 
subsidence more than by the processes outlined above. It is often 
a primary driver of elevated local SLR and increased ﬂood hazards 
in those regions. This is particularly true for deltaic systems, where 
fertile soils, low-relief topography, freshwater access, and strategic 
ports have encouraged the development of many of the world’s 
most densely populated coastlines and urban centres. For example, 
globally, one in fourteen humans resides in mid-to-low latitude 
deltas (Day et al., 2016). Although in these areas RSL is dominated 
by anthropogenic subsidence, climate effects need to be included for 
estimating risks associated with RSL (Syvitski et al., 2009).
Deltas are formed by the accumulation of unconsolidated river born 
sediments and porous organic material, both of which are particularly 
prone to compaction. It is the compaction which causes a drop in 
land elevation that increases the rate of local SLR above what would 
be observed along a static coastline or one where only climatological 
forced processes control the RSL. Under stable deltaic conditions, 
the accumulation of ﬂuvially-sourced surﬁcial sediment and organic 
matter offsets this natural subsidence (Syvitski and Saito, 2007); 
however, in many cases this natural process of delta construction has 
been disturbed by reductions in ﬂuvial sediment supply via upstream 
dams and ﬂuvial channelisation (Vörösmarty et al., 2003; Syvitski 
and Saito, 2007; Syvitski et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2017). Further, 
the extraction of ﬂuids and gas that ﬁll the pore space of deltaic 
sediments and provide support for overlying material has signiﬁcantly 
increased the rate of compaction and resultant anthropogenic 
subsidence along many populated deltas (Higgins, 2016). In addition, 
Nicholls (2011) pointed to anthropogenic subsidence by the weight 
of buildings in megacities in South-East Asia.
Average natural and anthropogenic subsidence rates of 6–9 mm yr–1 
are reported for the highly populated areas of Ganges-Brahmaputra-
Meghna delta in the urban centres of Kolkata and Dhaka (Brown and 
Nicholls, 2015). A fraction of these subsidence rates might be caused by 
long-term processes of increased sediment loading during the Holocene 
resulting from changes in the monsoon system (Karpytchev et al., 2018). 
Subsidence rates are expected to decrease in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-
Meghna delta in the near future due to planned dam projects and an 
estimated 21% drop in resulting sediment supply (Tessler et al., 2018). 
Observations of enhanced natural and anthropogenic subsidence

on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna are common to most heavily 
populated deltaic systems. Coastal mega-cities that have been 
particularly prone to human-enhanced subsidence include Bangkok, 
Ho Chi Minh city (Vachaud et al., 2018), Jakarta, Manila, New Orleans, 
West Netherlands and Shanghai (Yin et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2018). 
On a global scale, observed rates of modern deltaic anthropogenic 
subsidence range from 6–100  mm yr–1 (Bucx et al., 2015; Higgins, 
2016). Rates of recent deltaic subsidence over the last few decades 
have been at least twice the 3 mm yr–1 rate of GMSL rise observed 
over this same interval (Higgins, 2016; Tessler et al., 2018). Numerical 
models that have reproduced these observed rates of anthropogenic 
deltaic subsidence by considering human-induced compaction and 
reduced sediment supply, support anthropogenic causes for elevated 
rates of subsidence (Tessler et al., 2018).
In summary, ESL interacts with RSL rise including anthropogenic 
subsidence in many vulnerable areas (see Box 4.1). Therefore, it is 
concluded with high conﬁdence that the inclusion of local processes 
(wave effects, storm surges, tides, erosion, sedimentation and 
compaction) is essential to estimate local, relative and changes in ESL 
events. Although the effect of anthropogenic subsidence may be very 
large locally, it is not accounted for in the projection sections of this 
chapter as no global data sets are available which are consistent with 
RCP scenarios, and because the scale at which these processes take 
place is often smaller than the spatial scale used in climate models.
4.2.2.5 
Attribution of Sea Level Change 
to Anthropogenic Forcing
Bindoff et al. (2013) concluded that it is very likely that there has been 
a substantial contribution to ocean heat content from anthropogenic 
forcing (i.e., anthropogenic greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols 
and land use change) since the 1970s, that it is likely that loss of land 
ice is partly caused by anthropogenic forcing, and that as a result, it is 
very likely that there is an anthropogenic contribution to the observed 
trend in GMSL rise since 1970. However, these conclusions were 
based on the understanding of the responsible physical processes, 
since formal attribution studies dedicated to quantifying the effect of 
individual external forcings were not available for GMSLR. Since AR5, 
such formal studies have attributed changes in individual components 
of sea level change (i.e., thermosteric sea level change and glacier 
mass loss), and in the total GMSL, to anthropogenic forcing.
4.2.2.5.1 Attribution of individual components of sea level change 
to anthropogenic forcing
Marcos and Amores (2014) found that during the period 
1970–2005, 87% (95% conﬁdence interval: 72–100%) of the 
observed thermosteric SLR in the upper 700  m of the ocean was 
anthropogenic. Slangen et al. (2014b) included the full ocean depth 
in their analysis. They concluded that a combination of anthropogenic 
and natural forcing is necessary to explain the temporal evolution 
of observed global mean thermosteric sea level change during the 
period 1957–2005. Anthropogenic forcing was responsible for the 
amplitude of observed thermosteric sea level change, while natural 
forcing caused the forced variability of observations. Observations 
could best be reproduced by scaling the patterns from ‘natural-only’ 
forcing experiments by using a factor of 0.70 ± 0.30 (2 standard 
deviations of the CMIP5 ensemble subset used), indicating a 
potential overestimation of forced variability in the CMIP5 ensemble. 
Patterns from the ‘anthropogenic-only’ forcing experiments needed 
to be scaled by a factor of 1.08 ± 0.13 (2 standard deviations of the 
CMIP5 ensemble subset used), indicating a realistic response of the 
CMIP5 ensemble to anthropogenic forcing.
For the glacier contribution to GMSL, Marzeion et al. (2014) concluded 
that while natural climate forcing and long-term adjustment of the 
glaciers to the end of the preceding Little Ice Age lead to continuous 
glacier mass loss throughout the simulation period of 1851–2010, the 
observed rates of glacier mass loss since 1990 can only be explained 
by including anthropogenic forcing. During the period 1851–2010, 
only 25 ± 35% of global glacier mass loss can be attributed to 
anthropogenic forcing, but 69 ± 24% during the period 1991–2010 
(see Section 2.2.3 for a more detailed discussion of attribution of 
glacier mass change on regional scales).
There is medium conﬁdence in evidence linking GIS mass loss to 
anthropogenic climate change, and low conﬁdence in the evidence 
that AIS mass balance can be attributed to anthropogenic forcing (see 
Section 3.3.1.6 for a detailed discussion). The effects of groundwater 
depletion and reservoir impoundment on sea level change are 
anthropogenic by deﬁnition (e.g., Wada et al., 2012).
4.2.2.5.2 Attribution of global mean sea level change 
to anthropogenic forcing
By estimating a probabilistic upper range of long-term persistent 
natural sea level variability, Dangendorf et al. (2015) detected a 
fraction of observed sea level change that is unexplained by natural 
variability and concluded by inference that it is virtually certain 
that at least 45% of the observed increase in GMSL since 1900 is 
attributable to anthropogenic forcing. Similarly, Becker et al. (2014) 
provided statistical evidence that the observed sea level trend, 
both in the global mean and at selected tide gauge locations, is not 
consistent with unforced, internal variability. They inferred that more 
than half of the observed GMSL trend during the 20th century is 
attributable to anthropogenic forcing.
Slangen et al. (2016) reconstructed GMSL from 1900 to 2005 based 
on CMIP5 model simulations separating individual components 
of radiative climate forcing and combining the contributions of 
thermosteric sea level change with glacier and ice sheet mass loss. 
They found that the naturally caused sea level change, including the 
long-term adjustment of sea level to climate change preceding 1900, 
caused 67 ± 23% of observed change from 1900 to 1950, but only 
9 ± 18% between 1970 and 2005. Anthropogenic forcing was found 
to have caused 15 ± 55% of observed sea level change during 1900–
1950, but 69 ± 31% during 1970–2005. The sum of all contributions 
explains only 74 ± 22% of observed GMSL change during the period 
1900–2005 considering the mean of the reconstructions of Church 
and White (2011), Ray and Douglas (2011), Jevrejeva et al. (2014b) 
and Hay et al. (2015). However, the budget could be closed taking

inventory or have already melted (Parkes and Marzeion, 2018) which 
were not considered in Slangen et al. (2016).
Based on these multiple lines of evidence, there is high conﬁdence 
that anthropogenic forcing very likely is the dominant cause of 
observed GMSL rise since 1970.
4.2.3 
Projections of Sea Level Change
As a consequence of climate change, the global and regional mean 
sea level will change. Coupled climate models are used to make 
projections of the climate changes and the associated SLR. Results 
from the CMIP5 model archive used for AR5 provide information 
on expected changes in the oceans and on the evolution of climate, 
glaciers and ice sheets. New estimates from CMIP6 are not yet 
available and will be discussed in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report 
(AR6), hence only a partly updated projection can be presented here.
Coupled climate models can be applied on century time scales, to 
provide estimates of the steric (temperature and salinity effects 
on sea water density) and ocean dynamical (ocean circulation) 
components of sea level change, both globally and regionally. 
However, the glacier and ice sheet component are calculated off-line 
based on temperature and precipitation changes. In the AR5 report, 
changes in the SMB of glaciers and ice sheet were calculated 
from the global surface air temperature. In addition, GCMs also 
resolve climate variability related to changes in precipitation and 
evaporation. These changes are used to calculate short duration sea 
level changes (Cazenave and Cozannet, 2014; Hamlington et al., 
2017). With various degrees of success those models capture ENSO, 
PDO and other modes of variability (e.g., Yin et al., 2009; Zhang 
and Church, 2012), which affect sea level through redistributions 
of energy and salt in the ocean on slightly longer time scales. 
Off-line temperature and precipitation ﬁelds can be dynamically or 
statistically downscaled to match the high spatial resolution required 
for ice sheets and glaciers, but serious limitations remain. This 
deﬁciency limits adequate representation of potentially important 
feedbacks between changes in ice sheet geometry and climate, for 
example through fresh water and iceberg production that impact on 
ocean circulation and sea ice, which can have global consequences 
(Lenaerts et al., 2016; Donat-Magnin et al., 2017). Another limitation 
is the lack of coupling with the solid Earth which controls the ice 
sheet evolution (Whitehouse et al., 2019). Dynamics of the interaction 
of ice streams with bedrock and till at the ice base remain difﬁcult 
to model due to lack of direct observations. Nevertheless, several 
new ice sheet models have been generated over the last few years, 
particularly for Antarctica (Section 4.2.3.1) focusing on the dynamic 
contribution of the ice sheet to sea level change, which remains the 
key uncertainty in future projections (Church et al., 2013), particularly 
beyond 2050 (Kopp et al., 2014; Nauels et al., 2017b; Slangen et al., 
2017a; Horton et al., 2018). 
Information beyond that provided by climate models is needed  
to describe local and RSL changes. Geodynamic models are used to 
calculate RSL changes due to changes in ice mass in the past and future. 
This includes solid Earth deformation, gravitational and rotational 
changes, as ice and water are redistributed around the globe. Input 
for those models is provided by the mass changes following from 
the off-line land ice models, time series of terrestrial water mass 
changes which typically require climate input, and reconstruction of 
past ice sheet changes over the last glacial cycle provided by coupled 
ice-Earth models (de Boer et al., 2017). Combining these different 
models leads to projections of RSL (Section 4.2.3.2).
At the local spatial scales of speciﬁc cities, islands and stretches of 
coastlines, hydrodynamical models (Section 4.2.3.3) and knowledge 
about anthropogenic subsidence are necessary to analyse the 
impacts of highly variable processes leading to ESL, such as tropical 
cyclone-driven storm surges. These hydrodynamical models are 
capable of providing statistics on the variability or the change 
in variability of the water level required for ﬂood risk calculations 
at speciﬁc locations and at spatial scales of less than 1  km. The 
models also rely on input from climate models, like temperature, 
precipitation, wind regime, and storm tracks (Colbert et al., 2013; 
Garner et al., 2017). 
In summary, climate models play an important role at the various 
stages of projections in providing, together with emission scenarios, 
geodynamic, ice-dynamic and hydrodynamic models, the required 
information for hazard estimation for coasts and low-lying islands. 
This report relies on results of the CMIP5 model runs.
4.2.3.1 
Contribution of Ice Sheets to GMSL
4.2.3.1.1 Greenland
The GIS is currently losing mass at roughly twice the pace of the 
AIS (see Chapter  3 and Table  4.1). About 60% of the mass loss 
between 1991 and 2015 has been attributed to increasingly negative 
SMB from surface melt and runoff on the lower elevations of the 
ice sheet margin. Ice dynamical changes and increased discharge 
of marine-terminating glaciers account for the remaining 40% of 
mass loss (Csatho et al., 2014; Enderlin, 2014; van den Broeke et al., 
2016). The ability of ﬁrn on Greenland to retain meltwater until it 
refreezes has diminished markedly since the late 1990s, especially 
in lower elevations and on peripheral ice caps (Noël et al., 2017). 
Patterns of surface melt on Greenland are highly dependent on 
regional atmospheric patterns (Bevis et al., 2019), adding uncertainty 
to future projections of SMB. Melt-albedo feedbacks associated with 
darkening of the ice surface from ponded water, changes in snow and 
ﬁrn properties, and accumulation of impurities are also important, 
because they can strongly enhance surface melt (Tedesco et al., 2016; 
Ryan et al., 2018; Trusel et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2019). These processes 
are not fully captured by most Greenland-scale models which is an 
important deﬁciency, because surface processes tend to dominate 
uncertainty in future GIS model projections (e.g.,  Edwards et al., 
2014; Aschwanden et al., 2019). Increases in meltwater and changes 
in the basal hydrologic regime, once thought to have a possible 
destabilising effect on the ice sheet (Zwally et al., 2002), have been 
linked with recent reductions in ice velocity in western Greenland. On 
decadal time scales the effect of meltwater on ice dynamics are now 
assessed to be small (van de Wal et al., 2015; Flowers, 2018), which 
is supported by ice sheet model experiments (Shannon et al., 2013).

In sum, uncertain climate projections (Edwards et al., 2014), albedo 
evolution, uncertainties around meltwater buffering by ﬁrn, complex 
processes linking surface, englacial and basal hydrology with ice 
dynamics (Goelzer et al., 2013; Stevens et al., 2016; Noël et al., 
2017; Hempelmann et al., 2018) and meltwater induced melting 
at marine-terminating ice fronts (Chauché et al., 2014), and coarse 
spatial model resolution (Pattyn et al., 2018), all continue to provide 
substantial challenges for ice sheet and SMB models.
Greenland-scale ice sheet modelling since AR5 (Edwards et al., 
2014; Fürst et al., 2015; Vizcaino et al., 2015; Calov et al., 2018; 
Golledge et al., 2019; Aschwanden et al., 2019) has built upon earlier 
work by coupling the ice models with regional climate models and 
using multiple climate and ice sheet models within single studies 
(Edwards et al., 2014). Recent modelling studies use higher-order 
representations of ice ﬂow (Fürst et al., 2015), include more explicit 
representations of ice sheet processes including subglacial hydrology 
(Calov et al., 2018), run the models at higher resolution and with 
updated boundary conditions (Aschwanden et al., 2019), and account 
for two-way coupling between the ice sheet and the global ocean 
(Vizcaino et al., 2015; Golledge et al., 2019). Among these studies, 
Fürst et al. (2015), Vizcaino et al. (2015), and Aschwanden et al. 
(2019) provide projections following RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 
emissions scenarios. Calov et al. (2018) and Golledge et al. (2019) 
did not consider RCP2.6. Edwards et al. (2014) used the Special 
Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario which isn’t 
directly comparable to the other studies assessed here, but they do 
provide a rigorous analysis of uncertainty contributed by different 
climate forcings, varying simpliﬁcations of ice ﬂow equations and 
height-SMB feedbacks. 
Fürst et al. (2015) used ten different CMIP5 Atmosphere-Ocean 
General Circulation Model (AOGCM) simulations to provide ofﬂine 
SMB and ocean forcing for their Greenland-wide ice sheet model, 
accounting for inﬂuences of warming subsurface ocean temperatures 
and basal lubrication on ice dynamics. In their RCP8.5 ensemble, they 
found a GIS contribution to GMSL in 2100 of 10.15 cm ± 3.24 cm. 
Similarly, Calov et al. (2018) found a range of GMSL contributions 
between 4.6–13 cm, depending on which CMIP5 GCM is used to 
force their regional climate model to produce SMB forcing. The wide 
range of RCP8.5 results in these studies highlights the substantial 
climate-driven uncertainty in 21st century projections of the GIS 
as emphasised by Edwards et al. (2014). It was found that central 
estimates and ranges for RCP8.5 simulated by Fürst et al. (2015), Calov 
et al. (2018), and Golledge et al. (2019) are in reasonable agreement 
with previous multi-model results (Bindschadler et al., 2013) and 
the assessment of AR5 (Church et al., 2013), which reported a likely 
RCP8.5 range of Greenland’s contribution to GMSL between 7–21 cm 
by 2100 (Table 4.2.). The GIS simulations provided by Vizcaino et al. 
(2015), using a relatively course-resolution ice model (10 km) with 
SMB forcing provided by a single GCM, estimate much less ice loss 
than other recent studies. Their GMSL projections (Vizcaino et al., 
2015) also fall below the likely range of AR5 estimates. In contrast, 
the study by Aschwanden et al. (2019) shows a signiﬁcantly higher 
contribution to GMSL than the other studies, especially under RCP8.5 
and beyond 2100 (see 4.2.3.5). This may be due to their SMB forcing, 
which is based on spatially uniform warming derived from future 
CMIP5 GCM climatologies averaged over the entire Greenland region. 
As noted by earlier work (e.g., Van de Wal and Wild, 2001; Gregory 
and Huybrechts, 2006), this approach can overestimate melt rates 
in the ablation zone, which could account for their higher projected 
ice loss. It is noted that the process-based estimates of future GMSL 
rise from Greenland found in Aschwanden et al. (2019) are closest 
to those from an updated, structured judgement of glaciological 
and modelling experts (Bamber et al., 2019). Calculations from the 
expert elicitation (Bamber et al., 2019) result in higher estimates 
of Greenland ice loss than any of the process-based studies, with a 
mean and standard deviation of 33 ± 30 cm and a 17–83% range 
of 10–60 cm by 2100, following a climate scenario comparable to 
RCP8.5. The combination of the new process-based studies produces 
central estimates (Table  4.2) consistent with the likely ranges for 
Greenland’s contribution to GMSL in 2100 assessed by AR5.
Complimentary to the ice sheet scale simulations discussed above, 
Nick et al. (2013) used detailed ﬂowline models of four Greenland 
outlet glaciers (Petermann, Kangerdlugssuaq, Jakobshavn Isbræ, 
and Helheim) to estimate a dynamical contribution to sea level in 
an RCP8.5 scenario of 11.3–17.5 mm by 2100, and 29–49 mm, by 
2200. This demonstrates the limited potential of Greenland outlet 
glaciers alone to drive GMSL rise. Greenland-wide modelling studies 
(Table  4.2) consistently ﬁnd a dominant role of runoff relative to 
dynamic discharge of ice loss, and a long-term reduction in the rate of 
Table 4.2 |  Estimates of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contribution to Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL; cm) in 2100 reported by process-based modelling studies including 
the effects of both surface mass balance (SMB) and ice dynamics published since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5). Only model results including elevation-SMB 
feedback are shown. All values are reported as the contribution to GMSL in 2100 relative to 2000, with the exception of Aschwanden et al. (2019) who report values 
relative to 2008. The median estimate for comparison with AR5 is based on the average of the three simulations in Calov et al. (2018) using different General Climate 
Models (GCMs), combined with the central estimates from the other studies. RMSD (Fürst et al., 2015) is the Root Mean Squared Deviation from their ensemble median.

dynamic ice discharge to the ocean as the ice sheet margin thins and 
the termini of outlet glaciers retreat from the coast (Goelzer et al., 
2013; Lipscomb et al., 2013). Greenland’s bedrock geography and the 
limited, direct access of thick interior ice to the ocean ultimately limits 
the potential pace of GMSL rise from the GIS. Figure 4.7 illustrates 
a fundamental difference between Greenland and Antarctica. In 
Greenland, most of the bedrock at the ice sheet margin is above sea 
level (land terminating), with relatively narrow (generally <10 km 
wide) outlet glaciers reaching the ocean. In contrast, Antarctica 
has extensive areas with subglacial bedrock below sea level, and 
thick marine-terminating ice in direct contact with the open ocean. 
Recent subglacial mapping and mass conservation calculations since 
AR5 (Morlighem et al., 2014; Morlighem et al., 2017) revise earlier 
bathymetric maps under and around the ice sheet, and reveal deeper 
and more extensive valley networks extending into the GIS interior 
than previously known. Accurate subglacial topography is important 
for modelling individual Greenland outlet glaciers (Aschwanden 
et al., 2016; Morlighem et al., 2016); however, the importance of 
these revised bedrock boundary conditions for the broader ice sheet 
has yet to be fully tested. Based on the limited cross sectional area of 
subglacial valleys and outlet glaciers on Greenland (Figure 4.7) and 
the results of Nick et al. (2013), the effects of uncertain bathymetric 
boundary conditions are assessed to be small relative to the 
uncertainties in future SMB forcing (medium conﬁdence).
In summary, new modelling since AR5 is consistent with previous 
studies suggesting future Greenland ice loss over the 21st century 
will be dominated by surface processes, rather than dynamic ice 
discharge to the ocean, regardless of which emissions scenario 
is followed (high conﬁdence). Based on these modelling studies, 
the GIS is not expected to contribute more than 20  cm of GMSL 
rise by 2100 in a RCP8.5 scenario, similar to the upper end of the 
likely range reported by AR5 (Church et al., 2013). GIS simulations 
are most sensitive to uncertainties in the applied climate forcing, 
especially over this century (Edwards et al., 2014), but updated 
climate projections since AR5 are not yet available. Because of the 
consistency of recent modelling with the assessment of Church et al. 
(2013), Greenland’s contribution to future sea level reported in AR5 
was used in our projections of GMSL.
4.2.3.1.2 Antarctica
Unlike Greenland, most of the AIS margin terminates in the ocean. The 
AIS also contains almost eight times more glacial ice above ﬂotation 
than Greenland, and nearly half of this ice is marine-based, that is, 
grounded on bedrock hundreds of metres (or more) below sea level 
(Figure  4.7; Fretwell et al., 2013). In places where the subglacial 
bedrock slopes downward away from the coast (reverse-sloped), 
the marine-based glacial ice is susceptible to dynamical instabilities 
(Weertman, 1974; Schoof, 2007b; Pollard et al., 2015) that can 
contribute rapid ice loss (Cross-Chapter Box  8 in Chapter  3). The 
instabilities can be triggered by the loss or thinning of ice shelves 
through changes in the surrounding ocean and increased sub-ice melt 
rates and changes in the overlying atmosphere affecting SMB and 
surface meltwater production. Much progress has been made since 
AR5 in the understanding of these processes, but their representation in 
continental-scale models continue to be heavily parameterised in most 
cases. Complex interactions between the ice sheet, ocean, atmosphere 
and underlying bedrock also remain difﬁcult to simulate collectively. 
In contrast to Greenland, Antarctica’s recent contribution to SLR has 
been dominated by ice-dynamical processes rather than changes in 
SMB (Mouginot et al., 2014; Rignot et al., 2014; Scheuchl et al., 2016; 
Shen et al., 2018; The IMBIE team, 2018). Since AR5, it has become 
increasingly evident that this ice loss is being driven by sub-ice 
oceanic melt (thinning) of ice shelves (Paolo et al., 2015; Wouters

et al., 2015) and the resulting loss of back stress (buttressing) that 
impedes the seaward ﬂow of grounded ice upstream. Elevated melt 
rates are generally associated with the increased presence of warm 
Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) on the continental shelf (Khazendar 
et al., 2016). Dynamic ice loss driven by ocean changes have also 
been observed on the East Antarctic margin (Li et al., 2016; Shen et al., 
2018). This is an important development, because East Antarctica 
contains much more ice than West Antarctica, so even minor changes 
there could make major contributions to sea level in the future. 
Several of West Antarctica’s major outlet glaciers, including Pine Island 
Glacier, and Thwaites Glacier in the Amundsen Sea (Figure 4.8) have 
grounding lines currently retreating on retrograde bedrock (Rignot 
et al., 2014). Thwaites Glacier is particularly important (Figure 4.8), 
because it extends into the interior of the WAIS, where the bed is 
>2000 m below sea level in places. By itself, the Thwaites drainage 
area contains the equivalent of ~0.4 m GMSL (Holt et al., 2006; Millan 
et al., 2017), but loss of the glacier could have a destabilising impact 
on the entire WAIS (Feldmann and Levermann, 2015). The WAIS 
contains enough ice to raise GMSL by ~3.4 m (Fretwell et al., 2013). 
Since AR5, a number of ice sheet modelling studies have focussed on 
limited fractions of Antarctica and so are not included in estimating 
the SROCC Antarctic contribution to GMSL (see Section  4.2.3.2). 
However, these studies do allow an assessment of the potential for 
persistent and increasing ice loss, and the role of the marine ice sheet 
instability (MISI, see Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). 
Joughin et al. (2014) modelled the response of the Thwaites Glacier 
to a combination of elevated sub-ice melt rates and increased 
precipitation and found persistent future retreat, despite either the 
partial compensation of increased accumulation or a future reduction 
in melt. Sub-ice melt rates sustained at current levels were found 
to generate >1 mm yr–1 equivalent GMSL rise within a millennium. 
Higher melt rates and an assumed weak ice shelf triggered rapid 
retreat within a few centuries. Similarly, Waibel et al. (2018) used 
the BISICLES ice sheet model (Cornford et al., 2015) to investigate 
the potential for self-sustained retreat of Thwaites Glacier, by 
incrementally increasing sub-ice melt rates until retreat is triggered, 
and then returning to pre-retreat melt rates. Consistent with Joughin 
et al. (2014), they found self-sustained retreat of Thwaites Glacier 
through MISI. Most uncertainty in their future WAIS simulations 
arises from uncertainties in the long-term response of Thwaites 
Glacier (Figure 4.8). Nias et al. (2016) demonstrated model sensitivity 
of Thwaites Glacier to poorly resolved bedrock boundary conditions 
(small scale topography), pointing to the need for better geophysical 
information to reduce model uncertainty (Schlegel et al., 2018). 
Arthern and Williams (2017) used adaptive mesh techniques, but with 
a different formulation than Cornford et al., (2015), to simulate the 
future response of Amundsen Sea outlet glaciers. They demonstrate 
a sustained, but slow future retreat when sub-ice melt is maintained 
at current rates, and a direct relationship between the strength of 
ocean forcing and the pace of MISI-driven ice loss. Yu et al. (2018) 
simulate future Thwaites retreat using a range of model formulations 
with varying approximations of ice stress balance, different ocean 
melt schemes, and different basal friction laws. Like Arthern and 
Williams (2017) they ﬁnd model-speciﬁc dependencies in the rate 
of ice loss, but all of their simulations demonstrate sustained ice loss 
and a bathymetrically controlled future acceleration.
Like Thwaites, the neighbouring Pine Island Glacier (PIG) has also 
been thinning and retreating at an accelerating rate in recent decades, 
in response to incursions of warm CDW in the waters underlying the 
glacier’s ice shelf. These incursions of CDW are controlled in part by 
sea ﬂoor bathymetry and climatic variability (Dutrieux et al., 2014). 
Favier et al. (2014) used three models with differing formulations to 
simulate PIG’s response to elevated sub-ice melt. Consistent with 
modelling of Thwaites Glacier (Joughin et al., 2014), all three models 
demonstrate sustained future retreat at an increasing rate, as the 
glacier backs onto its retrograde bed. Only one of the three models 
used by Favier et al. (2014) demonstrates the possibility that the 
glacier can recover if sub-ice melt rates are reduced enough to allow 
the ice shelf to thicken and pin on bathymetric features to provide 
buttressing. These results highlight the long-term commitment to 
marine-based ice loss.
While limited to 50 year simulations, Seroussi et al. (2017) provide the 
ﬁrst interactively coupled ice-ocean model simulations of Thwaites 
Glacier at a high spatial resolution. Their model demonstrates 
MISI-like grounding line retreat at a rate of ~1 km yr–1, comparable 
to observations between 1992 and 2011 (Rignot et al., 2014). The 
retreat is interrupted when the main trunk of the glacier stabilises on 
a bathymetric ridge, ~20 km upstream of the present-day grounding 
line (Figure 4.8), but due to the short duration of the simulation, the 
long-term potential for additional retreat into the interior of the ice 
sheet is not captured. 
Despite the use of independent model formulations, forcings, and 
different geographic settings, the overall agreement among these 
highly-resolved regional modelling studies and their ability to capture 
current rates of retreat, increases conﬁdence since AR5 that observed 
retreat of Amundsen Sea outlet glaciers is driven by processes 
consistent with MISI theory (medium conﬁdence), will continue 
(medium conﬁdence), and could accelerate (medium conﬁdence).
Observations of rapid bedrock uplift in the Amundsen Sea, low 
viscosity of the underlying mantle, and short GIA response times to 
glacial unloading suggest ice-Earth interactions could be important 
there (Barletta et al., 2018). Bedrock uplift and reduced gravitational 
attraction between the ice sheet and ocean as an ice margin loses 
mass reduces RSL at the grounding line, promoting stability and 
providing a negative feedback on retreat (Adhikari et al., 2014; 
Gomez et al., 2015). Using a high-resolution ice sheet-Earth model, 
Larour et al. (2019) showed that long-term future retreat of Amundsen 
Sea grounding lines are slowed by these processes, but the effect 
is found to be minimal until after ~2250. This agrees with other 
recent modelling accounting for ice-Earth interactions, including the 
viscoelastic Earth response to changing ice loads and self-gravitation 
(Gomez et al., 2015; Konrad et al., 2015; Pollard et al., 2017). These 
studies also showed a small negative feedback on future retreat over 
the next several centuries, particularly under strong climate forcing. 
However, the viscosity structure of the Earth under the AIS is not 
well resolved, and lateral variations in Earth structure could impact 
these results (Hay et al., 2017). Based on these consistent model

results, and new observational evidence that PIG has been retreating 
on reverse-sloped bedrock for a half-century or more (Smith et al., 
2017), ice-Earth interactions are not expected to substantially slow 
GMSL rise from marine-based ice in Antarctica over the 21st century 
(medium conﬁdence). However, these processes could become 
important for GMSL rise on multi-century and longer time scales.
Atmospheric forcing is also becoming increasingly recognised to be 
an important factor for the future of the AIS. A sustained (15 days) 
melt event over the Ross Sea sector of the WAIS in 2016 illustrated 
both the connectivity of Antarctica to the tropics and El Niño, and the 
possibility that future meltwater production on ice shelf surfaces could 
change in the near future (Nicolas et al., 2017). This was highlighted 
by Trusel et al. (2015), who evaluated the future expansion of surface 
meltwater using the snow component in the RACMO2 regional 
atmospheric model (Kuipers Munneke et al., 2012) and output from 
CMIP5 GCMs. Under RCP8.5, they found a substantial expansion 
of surface meltwater production on ice shelves late in the 21st 
century that exceed melt rates observed before the 2002 collapse 
of the Larsen B Ice Shelf. Surface meltwater is important for both ice 
dynamics and SMB due to its potential to reduce albedo, saturate the 
ﬁrn layer, deepen surface crevasses, and to cause ﬂexural stresses 
that can contribute to ice shelf break-up (hydrofracturing) (Banwell 
et al., 2013; Kuipers Munneke et al., 2014). The presence of surface 
meltwater does not necessarily lead to immediate ice shelf collapse 
(Bell et al., 2017b; Kingslake et al., 2017), although surface meltwater 
was a precursor on ice shelves which have collapsed (Scambos et al., 
2004; Banwell et al., 2013). This dichotomy illustrates the uncertain 
role of meltwater and the need for additional study. When and if melt 
rates will be sufﬁciently high in future warming scenarios to trigger 
widespread hydrofracturing is a key question, because the loss of ice 
shelves is associated with the onset of marine ice sheet instabilities 
(Cross-chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). Based on the single modelling 
study by Trusel et al. (2015), it is not expected that widespread ice 
shelf loss will occur before the end of the 21st century, but due to 
limited observations and modelling to date, there is low conﬁdence 
in this assessment.
Continental-scale ice sheet simulations are ultimately required 
to provide projections of future GMSL rise from Antarctica. At this 
spatial scale, most models rely on simplifying approximations of the 
equations representing three-dimensional ice ﬂow, and in some cases 
they parameterise ice ﬂow at the grounding line (Schoof, 2007b) to 
improve computational efﬁciency. Such simpliﬁcations are necessary 
to allow long simulations that can be validated against geological 
information, in addition to modern observations (Briggs et al., 2013; 
Pollard et al., 2016), however processes related to MISI are best 
represented at high spatial resolution and without simpliﬁcations of 
the underlying physics (Pattyn et al., 2013; Reese et al., 2018c).
Various ice sheet model formulations, including the choice of 
grounding line parameterisations and basal sliding schemes can 
strongly affect model response to a given forcing (Brondex et al., 
2017; Pattyn, 2017), although sophisticated statistical methodologies 
have been increasingly used since AR5 to quantitatively gauge model 
uncertainty (Bulthuis et al., 2019; Edwards et al., 2019). Accurate 
atmospheric forcing (SMB) and sub-ice melt are also prerequisite 
to resolving the time-evolving dynamics of the system, with sub-ice 
melt rates being particularly important (Schlegel et al., 2018). An 
important ongoing deﬁciency is the lack of ice-ocean coupling in 
most continental-scale studies, which remains too computationally 
expensive to simulate the ocean at the spatial scales necessary to 
capture circulation in ice shelf cavities and time-evolving ice-ocean 
interactions (Donat-Magnin et al., 2017; Hellmer et al., 2017). Instead, 
melt rates are often parameterised as a depth dependent function of 
nearby ocean temperature derived from ofﬂine ocean models, but 
the lack of ice-ocean interaction can seriously overestimate melt 
rates in some settings (de Rydt et al., 2015; Seroussi et al., 2017). 
Approaches that link ofﬂine ocean temperatures with efﬁcient box 
models of the circulation in ice shelf cavities have been developed 
(Lazeroms et al., 2018; Reese et al., 2018a) and used in long-term

Figure 4.8 |  Processes affecting the Thwaites Glacier in the Amundsen Sea sector of Antarctica (adapted from Scambos et al., 2017). The grounding line is currently 
retreating on reverse-sloped bedrock at a water depth of ~600 m (Joughin et al., 2014; Mouginot et al., 2014). The glacier terminus is ~120 km wide, widens upstream, 
and is minimally buttressed by a laterally discontinuous ~40 km long ice shelf. The remaining shelf is thinning in response to warm, sub-shelf incursions of circumpolar 
deep water (CDW), with melt rates up 200 m yr–1 near the groundling line in some places (Milillo et al., 2019). The bathymetry upstream of the grounding zone is complex, 
but it generally slopes downward into a deep basin, up to 2000 m below sea level under the centre of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) (far left), making the glacier 
vulnerable to marine ice sheet instabilities (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).

future simulations (Bulthuis et al., 2019), although they still require 
uncoupled ocean models to provide time-evolving ocean conditions 
outside the cavities.
Ritz et al. (2015) used a hybrid physical-statistical modelling approach, 
whereby the timing of MISI onset is determined statistically rather 
than physically. They estimated probabilities of MISI onset in eleven 
different sectors around the ice sheet margin based on observations 
of continent-wide retreat and thinning over the last few decades, 
and expected future climate change following an IPCC SRES A1B 
emission scenario only. In places where MISI is projected to begin, 
the persistence and rate of grounding-line retreat is parameterised 
as a function of the local bedrock topography (slope), ice thickness 
at grounding lines following Schoof (2007b), and basal friction. This 
study represents a statistically rigorous approach in which model 
parameters are based on a synthesis of observations and projected 
surface and sub-shelf forcing, rather than coming directly from 
climate and ocean models. However, the model calibrations rely 
on recent observations, which may not provide adequate guidance 
under warmer future conditions.
Levermann et al. (2014) use simpliﬁed emulations of temperature 
increase in order to estimate both SMB and sub-ice melt (including a 
parameterised delay for ocean warming) to determine the linearised 
response of ﬁve ice sheet models calibrated against recent rates 
of retreat. Substantial uncertainty arises from the different model 
treatments of grounding line dynamics and ice shelves. However, 
they conclude that the single greatest source of uncertainty stems 
from the external forcing.
Golledge et al. (2015) used PISM (Parallel Ice Sheet Model; 
Winkelmann et al., 2011) to simulate the future response of the AIS 
to RCP emission scenarios. PISM links grounded, streaming, and shelf 
ﬂow, and has freely evolving grounding lines required to capture 
MISI. PISM’s parameterised treatment of sub-ice melt applies melt 
under partially grounded grid cells (Feldmann and Levermann, 2015), 
making the model sensitive to subsurface ocean warming, although 
the validity of this approach is contested (Arthern and Williams, 2017; 
Seroussi and Morlighem, 2018; Yu et al., 2018). While providing 
alternative outcomes with the two basal melt rate parameterisations, 
the model is not calibrated to observations and doesn’t provide a 
probability distribution. In a subsequent study Golledge et al. (2019) 
used PISM, but with updated RCP climate forcing based on CMIP5 
GCMs, and with sub-ice ocean melt calibrated to observations. An 
ofﬂine, intermediate-complexity climate model was used to capture 
global ice-climate feedbacks ignored in most other studies, but the 
simulations only include RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and do not extend 
beyond 2100. Accounting for the climatic effects of meltwater input 
from Greenland and Antarctica nearly doubled their estimates of 
Antarctic’s contribution to GMSL in 2100 from 2.4 cm to 4.6 cm in 
RCP4.5, and from 7.7 cm to 14 cm in RCP8.5. The increase is caused 
by a combination of SMB decrease over the WAIS, combined with 
subsurface ocean warming that increases sub-ice melt. However, the 
climate model used to diagnose the spatial patterns of the atmospheric 
and oceanic response to the meltwater input is simplistic. Bronselaer 
et al. (2018) tested the global climatic response to future meltwater 
input from Antarctica using an ensemble of GCM simulations, but 
without an interactive ice sheet. They simulated an RCP8.5 scenario 
with and without a massive input of meltwater into the Southern 
Ocean and demonstrate that the addition of Antarctic meltwater 
expands sea ice in the Southern Ocean, delays the trajectory of 
global warming, and moderates atmospheric warming around the 
Antarctic coastline. Consistent with Golledge et al. (2019), they found 
meltwater-induced stratiﬁcation around Antarctica warms subsurface 
ocean temperatures, indicating the potential for a positive meltwater 
feedback on ice shelf melt. These studies reinforce the need for 
continental-scale studies to consider two-way ice-climate coupling, 
but with limited published studies to draw from and no simulations 
run beyond 2100, ﬁrm conclusions regarding the net importance of 
atmospheric versus ocean melt feedbacks on the long-term future of 
Antarctica can not be made.
Bulthuis et al. (2019) used a different continental-scale ice sheet 
model (Pattyn, 2017) with the same simpliﬁed atmospheric and 
ocean forcing used by Golledge et al. (2015) to simulate RCP2.6, 
RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios. Simulations with varying model 
parameters were used to quantify uncertainties related to the 
atmospheric forcing, various ice-model physics, and bedrock response 
to changing ice loads. A key ﬁnding was that irrespective of model 
parametric uncertainty, the strongly mitigated RCP2.6 scenario 
prevents catastrophic WAIS collapse over the coming centuries. The 
probabilistic projections of Antarctic GMSL contributions (Bulthuis 
et al., 2019) represent a rigorous blending of physical ice sheet 
modelling and uncertainty quantiﬁcation (UQ) techniques, albeit with 
a simplistic representation of future climate and using a relatively 
coarse-resolution ice sheet model. These results are well-supported 
by Schlegel et al. (2018), who blend UQ with a higher resolution ice 
sheet model than used by Bulthuis et al. (2019), but using an idealised 
climate forcing scheme not directly linked to time-evolving future 
climate trajectories. Their 800 simulations, run to 2100, provide not 
only probabilistic constraints on future GMSL-rise from Antarctica, 
but an assessment of key drivers of uncertainty, including uniform 
and regional dependencies on model physical parameters, climate 
forcing, and boundary conditions. Sub-ice shelf melt rates provide 
the greatest source of uncertainty in their projections, although the 
source region dominating the GMSL contribution is found to be 
dependent on the climate forcing applied, and different from those 
found by Golledge et al. (2015).
DeConto and Pollard (2016) used an ice sheet model with a 
formulation similar to that used by Golledge et al. (2015) and Bulthuis 
et al. (2019) but they include glaciological processes not accounted 
for in other continental-scale models: 1) surface melt and rain water 
inﬂuence on hydrofracturing of ice shelves; and 2) brittle failure of 
thick, marine-terminating ice fronts that have lost their buttressing 
ice shelves. Where the ice fronts are thick enough to form tall ice cliffs 
above the waterline, they can produce stresses exceeding the strength 
of the ice, causing calving (Bassis and Walker, 2012). Once initiated, 
ice-cliff calving has been hypothesised to produce a self-sustaining 
Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI; Cross-chapter Box 8, Chapter 3). 
The validity of MICI remains unproven (Edwards et al., 2019) and 
is considered to be characterised by ‘deep uncertainty’, but it has 
the potential to raise GMSL faster than MISI. DeConto and Pollard 
(2016) represent hydrofracturing and ice-cliff calving with simple 
350

parameterisations, but the glaciological processes themselves are 
supported by more detailed modelling and observations (Scambos 
et al., 2009; Banwell et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2017; Wise et al., 2017; 
Parizek et al., 2019). DeConto and Pollard (2016) provide four 
ensembles for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, representing 
two alternative ocean model treatments and two alternative palaeo 
sea level targets used to tune their model physical parameters. 
However, their ensembles do not explore the full range of model 
parameter space or provide a probabilistic assessment (Kopp et al., 
2017; Edwards et al., 2019). Under RCP2.6, DeConto and Pollard 
(2016) ﬁnd very little GMSL rise from Antarctica by 2100 (0.02–
0.16 m), consistent with the ﬁndings of Golledge et al. (2015) and 
Bulthuis et al. (2019). In contrast, their four ensemble means range 
between 0.26–0.58 m for RCP4.5, and 0.64–1.14 m for RCP8.5. In 
RCP8.5, rates of GMSL rise from Antarctica exceed 5 cm yr–1 in the 
22nd century and contribute as much as 15 m of GMSL rise by 2500, 
largely due to the ice cliff calving process. The climate forcing used by 
DeConto and Pollard (2016) simulates the appearance of extensive 
surface meltwater several decades earlier than indicated by other 
CMIP5 climate simulations (Trusel et al., 2015). Because their model 
physics are sensitive to melt water through hydrofracturing, this 
makes the timing and magnitude of their simulated ice loss too 
uncertain to include in SROCC sea level projections. However, their 
results do demonstrate the potential for brittle ice sheet processes 
not considered by AR5 to exert a strong inﬂuence on future rates 
of GMSL rise and the possibility that GMSL beyond 2100 could be 
considerably higher than the likely range projected by models that do 
not include these processes.
4.2.3.2 
Global and Regional Projections of Sea Level Rise
In addition to the model including MICI from DeConto and Pollard 
(2016), only a subset of studies (Levermann et al., 2014; Golledge 
et al., 2015; Ritz et al., 2015; Bulthuis et al., 2019; Golledge et al., 
2019), and statistical emulation of DeConto and Pollard (2016) by 
Edwards et al. (2019) provide continental-scale estimates of future 
Antarctic ice loss, under a range of GHG emissions scenarios. They 
all provide probabilistic information, but vary considerably, both 
in their physical approaches and their resulting projections of 
Antarctica’s future contribution to GMSL. Such variations facilitate 
the ﬁrst quantitative uncertainty assessment of the full dynamical 
contribution of Antarctica, which could not be made by Church 
et al. (2013) in AR5. The assessment by Church et al. (2013), based 
on a single statistical-physical model, reported median values (and 
likely ranges) of 0.05 m (-0.04–0.13) and 0.04 m (-0.06–0.12), for 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, for the total Antarctic contribution 
in 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, and added the following: 
‘Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based 
sectors of the AIS, if initiated, could cause GMSL to rise substantially 
above the likely range during the 21st century. This potential 
additional contribution cannot be precisely quantiﬁed but there is 
medium conﬁdence that it would not exceed several tenths of a 
metre of SLR during the 21st century (Church et al., 2013). Given the 
above-mentioned publications after AR5, Antarctica’s contribution to 
sea level change was reassessed and now include the possibility of 
MISI allowing for a more complete assessment of the likely range 
of the projections for three RCP scenarios. Our assessment is based 
on process-based numerical models of the AIS, driven by diverse 
climate scenarios. Results are discussed in the context of an expert 
elicitation study (Bamber et al., 2019), probabilistic studies (Perrette 
et al., 2013; Slangen et al., 2014a; Grinsted et al., 2015; Jackson 
and Jevrejeva, 2016) and a sensitivity study (Schlegel et al., 2018) 
assessing the uncertainty in snow accumulation, ocean-induced 
melting, ice viscosity, basal friction, bedrock elevation and the effect 
of ice shelves on ice mass loss in 2100, Figure 4.4.
Ritz et al. (2015) is difﬁcult to contextualise as they only provided 
estimates for the A1B scenario and not for the RCP scenarios. Despite 
this limitation their results, which are close to the other studies, 
are included as if they represent RCP8.5 and as such supports the 
assessment. The results by DeConto and Pollard (2016) indicate 
signiﬁcantly higher mass loss even for RCP4.5, potentially related to 
their high surface melt rates on the ice shelves as contested by Trusel 
et al. (2015). This early onset of high surface melt rates in DeConto and 
Pollard (2016) leads to extensive hydrofracturing of ice shelves before 
the end of the 21st century and therefore to rapid ice mass loss. For this 
reason, their results and probabilistic (e.g., Kopp et al., 2017; Le Bars 
et al., 2017) and statistical emulation estimates that build on them 
(Edwards et al., 2019), are not used in SROCC sea level projections. 
Consequently, the process-based studies by Golledge et al. (2015), 
Ritz et al. (2015), Levermann et al. (2014), Golledge et al. (2019), and 
Bulthuis et al. (2019) are used to assess the Antarctic contribution for 
the different RCP scenarios. The study by Schlegel et al. (2018) does 
not provide RCP based scenarios, but is considered as an extensive 
sensitivity estimate providing a high-end estimate based on physical 
process understanding of the Antarctic contribution. 
Each study expresses an uncertainty in the Antarctic contribution to 
GMSL rise which is, in part, dependent on a common driver, namely 
regional warming. The uncertainties were therefore interpreted as 
being dependent and propagate the total uncertainty accordingly. As 
a result, the total uncertainty exceeds that of the individual studies, 
which reﬂects that the individual studies only sample a fraction of 
the total uncertainty. The uncertainty estimates of Levermann et al. 
(2014) concentrate on the oceanic basal melt rates including a time 
delay between atmosphere and ocean temperature, but do not 
consider other sources of uncertainty. Ritz et al. (2015) is constrained 
by observations and provides an asymmetric distribution of the rate 
of mass loss. The ice sheet simulations by Golledge et al. (2015) 
and Golledge et al. (2019) only provide two alternative subgrid 
parameterisations for sub-ice melt, rather than a statistical estimate 
of the uncertainty. The more sensitive of these two parameterisations 
which induces more ice loss is challenged by Seroussi and Morlighem 
(2018). In order to assess a realistic uncertainty for the total Antarctic 
contribution, it was ﬁrst assumed that Golledge et al. (2015) and 
Golledge et al. (2019) are dependent, because they use similar 
parameterisations. For each study, a probabilistic distribution is used, 
assuming a normal distribution with a likely range bounded by the 
high and low estimate from those studies. Levermann et al. (2014) 
also provides two alternatives, one with and one without a time 
delay between oceanic temperatures below the Antarctic ice shelves 
and global mean atmospheric temperature. As it is unclear which 
version best matches the updated record of ice loss presented by The 
IMBIE team, (2018), results are combined assuming full probabalistic

dependence as for the two Golledge studies. Bulthuis et al. (2019) 
uses a simpliﬁed ice sheet model to study the uncertainty caused 
by the atmospheric forcing, ice dynamics, ice and bed rheology, 
calving and sub-shelf melting. Finally, the studies by Ritz et al. 
(2015), Bulthuis et al. (2019) and the averages for Golledge and 
Levermann are combined to identify a best estimate for the Antarctic 
contribution under RCP8.5. This results in a median contribution of 
16 cm in 2100 under RCP8.5. A Monte Carlo technique is used to 
combine the uncertainties in the aforementioned studies, assuming 
mutual dependence. The resulting 5–95 percentile range, 2–37 cm in 
2100 under RCP8.5, is assessed as the likely range. This assessment is 
used in order to reﬂect ongoing limited understanding of the physics 
and the fact that the individual studies only reﬂect part of the total 
uncertainty. The distribution is slightly skewed to higher values, 
because of an underlying skewness in the studies of Levermann et al. 
(2014) and Ritz et al. (2015). This skewed distribution is supported by 
an expert elicitation study (Bamber et al., 2009). The expert elicitation 
approach (Bamber et al., 2018), which applied elicitation to both ice 
sheets, suggests considerably higher values for total SLR for RCP2.6, 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 than provided in Table 4.3.
As the importance of MISI and MICI is difﬁcult to assess on longer 
time scales, there remains deep uncertainty for the Antarctic 
contribution to GMSL after 2100 (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). 
Results on these long-time scales are discussed in 4.2.3.5.
There is limited evidence for major changes since AR5 in the 
non-Antarctic components. Recent projections of the glacier 
contribution are nearly identical to AR5 results used here (see 
Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2). Greenland, thermal expansion 
and land water storage are also not updated, mainly due to a 
lack of updated CMIP simulations. Hence, our revised projections 
replace only the AR5 estimate for Antarctica by a new assessment 
as outlined in the previous paragraph based on post-AR5 literature 
and maintaining identical contributions for the non-Antarctic 
components. As no general dependence between the Antarctic 
contribution and the non-Antarctic components can be derived from 
the four studies, independent uncertainties are assumed, which is 
close to the uncertainty propagation by Church et al. (2013).
Time series for the different RCP scenarios are shown in Figure 4.9 
indicating a divergence in median and upper likely range for RCP8.5 
during the second half of the century between this report and the 
AR5 projections (Church et al., 2013). The value of the Antarctic 
contribution in 2081–2100 under RCP8.5 is the individual component 
with the largest uncertainty. As a consequence, the uncertainty 
in the GMSL projections is slightly increased compared to Church 
et al. (2013). Nevertheless, results can also be considered to be 
consistent with Church et al. (2013). In AR5, the potential additional 
contribution by ice dynamics, was estimated to be not more than 
several tenths of a metre but excluded from projections; here this

value was assessed to be 16  cm (5–95 percentile; 2–37 cm) and 
include it in the projections. As the projections build on the CMIP5 
work presented in AR5, and also given the limited exploration of 
uncertainty in estimates from each individual study, the results of 
the 5–95 percentile are interpreted to represent the likely range, that 
is, the 17–83 percentile, as assessed by Church et al. (2013) and as 
assessed in AR5 for other CMIP5-derived results.
Projections as presented in Table 4.4 are used to calculate the regional 
RSL projections as outlined in AR5 by including gravitational and 
rotational patterns as shown in Figure 4.10 and subsequently used 
in 4.2.3.4 to calculate ESL projections. Including the updated results 
in terms of magnitude and uncertainty for the Antarctic component 
also changes the regional patterns in sea level projections. Results 
of the regional patterns in Figure 4.10 show an increased SLR with 
respect to the results presented in AR5 nearly everywhere for RCP8.5 
because of the increased Antarctic contribution.

4.2.3.3 
Probabilistic Sea Level Projections
Since AR5, several studies have produced SLR projections in coherent 
frameworks that link together global-mean and RSL rise projections. 
The approaches are generally similar to those adopted by AR5 for 
its global-mean sea level projections: a bottom-up accounting of 
different contributing processes (e.g.,  land-ice mass loss, thermal 
expansion, dynamic sea level), of which many are ‘probabilistic’, 
in that they attempt to describe more comprehensive probability 
distributions of sea level change than the likely ranges presented 
by Church et al. (2013). An overview of probabilistic approaches is 
presented in Garner et al. (2017), indicating higher values for post 
AR5 studies mainly reﬂecting increased uncertainty based on a single 
contested study for the Antarctic contribution (DeConto and Pollard, 
2016). As such many of these probabilistic studies present full 
probability density function conditional not only on an RCP scenario, 
but with additional and equally important a priori assumptions 
concerning for instance the Antarctic contribution over which a 
consensus has yet to solidify. An example is the study by Le Bars 
et al. (2017) who expand the projection by Church et al. (2013) in 
a probabilistic way with the Antarctic projections by DeConto and 
Pollard (2016) to obtain a full probability density function for SLR 
for RCP8.5. Other probabilistic approaches are provided by Kopp 
et al. (2014) and Jackson and Jevrejeva (2016) using different ice 
sheet representations drawing on expert elicitation (Bamber and 
Aspinall, 2013). Probabilistic estimates are useful for a quantitative 
risk management perspective (see Section  4.3.3). An even more 
general approach than the probabilistic estimates has been taken 
by Le Cozannet et al. (2017) who frame a ‘possibilistic’ framework of 
SLR including existing probabilistic estimates and combining them.

This section ﬁrst brieﬂy reviews key sources of information for 
probabilistic projections (Section  4.2.3.3.1), with a focus on 
new results since AR5, then summarises the different global and 
regional projections (Section  4.2.3.3.2). Eventually, bottom-up 
projections were distinguished which explicitly describe the 
different components of SLR (Section 4.2.3.3.3) from semi-empirical 
projections (Section 4.2.3.3.4).
4.2.3.3.1 Components of probabilistic global mean  
sea level projections
Thermal expansion: Global mean thermal expansion projections rely 
on coupled climate models projections (Kopp et al., 2014; Slangen 
et al., 2014a; Jackson and Jevrejeva, 2016) or simple climate model 
projections (Perrette et al., 2013; Nauels et al., 2017b; Wong et al., 
2017), and are substantively unchanged since AR5. For those studies 
relying on the CMIP5 GCM ensemble, interpretations of the model 
output differ mainly with regard to how the range is understood. For 
example, Kopp et al. (2014), interprets the 5–95 percentile of CMIP5 
values as a likely range of thermal expansion. The differences among 
the studies yield discrepancies smaller than 10 cm, e.g., Slangen et al. 
(2014a) use 20–36 cm in 2081–2100 with respect to 1986–2005, 
while (Kopp et al., 2014) project a likely range of 28–46 cm in 2081–
2099 with respect to 1991–2009. 
Glaciers: Projections of glacier mass change rely either on models of 
glacier SMB and geometry, forced by temperature and precipitation 
ﬁelds (Slangen and Van de Wal, 2011; Marzeion et al., 2012; 
Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Radić et al., 2014; Huss and Hock, 2015), or 
simple scaling relationships with global mean temperature (Perrette 
et al., 2013; Bakker et al., 2017; Nauels et al., 2017a). Glacier mass 
change projections published since AR5, based on newly developed 
glacier models, conﬁrm the overall assessment of AR5 (see also 
Section 4.2.3.2).
Land water storage: Projections of the GMSL rise contributions due 
to dam impoundment and groundwater withdrawal are generally 
either calibrated to hydrological models (e.g., Wada et al., 2012) or 
neglected. Recent coupled climate-hydrological modelling suggests 
that a signiﬁcant minority of pumped groundwater remains on land, 
which may reduce total GMSL rise relative to studies assuming full 
drainage to the ocean (Wada et al., 2016). Kopp et al. (2014) estimated 
land water storage based on population projections. However, there 
are no substantive updates to projections of the future land-water 
storage contribution to GMSL rise since AR5.
Ice sheets: GMSL projections in previous IPCC assessments were 
based on results from physical models of varying degree of complexity 
interpreted using expert judgment of the assessment authors (Meehl 
et al., 2007; Church et al., 2013). AR5 (Church et al., 2013) used this 
approach and is partly based on the assessment of statistical-physical 
modelling of the Antarctic contribution (Little et al., 2013). As an 
alternative to the model-based approach, several studies have applied 
structured expert elicitation to the GMSL contribution of ice sheets. 
This approach is based on a more formal expert elicitation protocol 
(Cooke, 1991; Bamber and Aspinall, 2013; Bamber et al., 2019) instead 
of physically based models. Combining the Antarctic contribution from 
the expert elicitation with the non-Antarctic components from AR5 as 
done for Table 4.4 leads to an estimated SLR of 0.95 m (median) for 
the high scenario and an upper likely range of 1.32 m (Figure 4.2), 
which is slightly higher than the process-based results. Results by 
Bamber and Aspinall (2013) were criticised because of their procedure 
for post-processing the expert data of individual ice sheets to a total 
sea level contribution from the ice sheets (de Vries and van de Wal, 
2015; Bamber et al., 2016; de Vries and van de Wal, 2016). Bamber 
et al. (2019) avoids this issue by eliciting expert judgments about ice 
sheet dependence. Alternatively, Horton et al. (2014) used a simpler 
elicitation protocol focusing on the total SLR rather than the ice sheet 
contribution alone. Finally, several probabilistic studies (e.g., Bakker 
et al., 2017; Kopp et al., 2017; Le Bars et al., 2017) used the results of 
a single ice sheet model study from DeConto and Pollard (2016) as the 
Antarctic contribution to GMSL.
Beside the total contribution of ice sheets several studies address 
the individual contribution of either Greenland or Antarctica (see 
Section  4.2.3.1.1 and 4.2.3.1.2) based on ice dynamical studies. 
Critical for GMSL projections is the low conﬁdence in the dynamic 
contribution of the AIS beyond 2050 in previous assessments, as 
discussed in Section 4.2.3.1.2.
4.2.3.3.2 From probabilistic global mean sea level projections 
to regional relative sea level change
Differences between GMSL and RSL change are driven by three main 
factors: (1) changes in the ocean, for instance, the thermal expansion 
component and the circulation driven changes, (2) gravitational and 
rotational effects caused by redistribution of mass within cryosphere 
and hydrosphere, leading to spatial patterns, and (3) long term 
processes caused by GIA that lead to horizontal and VLM. Finally, 
the inverse barometer effect caused by changes in the atmospheric 
pressure, sometimes neglected in projections, can also make a small 
contribution, particularly on shorter time scales. For the 21st century 
as a whole, estimates of the latter are smaller than 5 cm at local 
scales (Church et al., 2013; Carson et al., 2016).
Ocean Dynamic sea level: Projections of dynamic sea level change are 
necessarily derived through interpretations of coupled climate model 
projections. As with thermal expansion projections, interpretations 
of the CMIP5 ensemble differ with regard to how the model range 
is understood and the manner of drift correction, if any (Jackson 
and Jevrejeva, 2016). However, relative to tide-gauge observations, 
coupled climate models tend to overestimate the memory in dynamic 
sea level; thus, they may underestimate the emergence of the 
externally forced signal of DSL change above scenario uncertainty 
(Becker et al., 2016). ODSL from coupled climate models does not 
include the changes resulting from ice melt because ice melt is 
calculated off-line.
Gravitational-rotational and deformational effects (GRD; Gregory 
et al., 2019): All projections of RSL change include spatial patterns 
in sea level for cryospheric changes, which however may differ in the 
details with which these are represented. Some studies also include a 
spatial pattern for land-water storage change (Slangen et al., 2014a), 
anthropogenic subsidence is not included. Recent work indicates 
355

Chapter 4
4
that, for some regions with low mantle viscosity, spatial patterns 
cannot be treated as ﬁxed on multi-century time scales (Hay et al., 
2017). This effect has not yet been incorporated into comprehensive 
RSL projections, but is probably only of relevance near ice sheets. 
For adaptation purposes, Larour et al. (2017) developed a mapping 
method to indicate which areas of ice mass loss are important for 
which major port city. There is high conﬁdence in the patterns caused 
by GRD, as in AR5.
Vertical land motion (VLM): These processes can be an important 
driver of RSL change, particularly in the near- to intermediate-ﬁeld 
of the large ice sheets of the LGM (e.g., North America and northern 
Europe). This process is incorporated either by physical modelling 
(Slangen et al., 2014a) or by estimation of a long-term trend from 
tide-gauge data (e.g., Kopp et al., 2014), which is then spatially 
extrapolated. In the former case, only the long-term GIA process 
is included in the projections, but it excludes other important local 
factors contributing to VLM (e.g., tectonic uplift/subsidence and 
groundwater/hydrocarbon withdrawal); by using only tide gauge 
measurements, projections may assume that these other processes 
proceed at a steady rate and thus do not allow for management 
changes that affect groundwater extraction.
4.2.3.3.3 Semi-empirical projections
Semi-empirical models provide an alternative approach to 
process-based models aiming to close the budget between the 
observed SLR and the sum of the different components contributing 
to SLR. In general, motivated by a mechanistic understanding, 
semi-empirical models use statistical correlations from time series 
analysis of observations to generate projections (Rahmstorf, 2007; 
Vermeer and Rahmstorf, 2009; Grinsted et al., 2010; Kemp et al., 2011; 
Kopp et al., 2016). They implicitly assume that the processes driving 
the observations and feedback mechanisms remain similar over the 
past and future. In the past, differences between semi-empirical 
projections and process-based models were signiﬁcant but for

more recent studies the differences are vanishingly small. Ongoing 
advances in closing the sea level budget and in the process 
understanding of the dynamics of ice have reduced the salience of 
estimates from semi-empirical models. Moreover, the results from 
semi-empirical models (Kopp et al., 2016; Mengel et al., 2016) are 
in general agreement with Church et al. (2013), except when those 
results reﬂect the combined hydrofracturing and ice cliff instability 
mechanism as presented by DeConto and Pollard (2016). At the same 
time, semi-empirical models based on past observations capture 
poorly or miss altogether the recent observed changes in Antarctica. 
MISI may lend a very different character to ice sheet evolution in 
the near future than in the recent past and hydrofracturing remains 
impossible to quantify from observational records only. For this 
reason, a new generation of semi-empirical models and emulators 
has been developed that estimate individual components of SLR, 
which the former models do not (Mengel et al., 2018). These newer 
models aim to emulate the response of more complex models 
providing more detailed information for different climate scenarios 
or probability estimates than process-based models (Bakker et al., 
2017; Nauels et al., 2017a; Wong et al., 2017; Edwards et al., 2019).
4.2.3.3.4 Recent probabilistic and semi-empirical projections
A wide range of probabilistic sea level projections exist, ranging from 
simple scaling relations to partly process-based components combined 
with scaling relations. Table 4.5 illustrates the overlap between many 
of the studies, a complete overview is presented by Garner et al. (2017), 
and differences between different classes of models are discussed in 
Horton et al. (2018). Many studies rely on CMIP simulations for an 
important part of their sea level components. The largest difference 
can be found in the treatment of the ice dynamics, particularly for 
Antarctica, which are usually not CMIP5 based. Instead, each derives 
from one of several estimates of the Antarctic contribution. These 
results are useful for the purposes of elucidating sensitivities of 
process-based studies and effects of changing components to the 
total projection. This report relies on the Antarctic component from 
Section 4.2.3.2 for calculating the likely range of RSL. Hence the values 
in Table 4.5 are not used for the ﬁnal assessment of RSL including 
the SROCC speciﬁc Antarctic contribution presented in Section 4.2.3.2. 
Comparing the probabilistic projections (Table 4.6) is difﬁcult because 
of the subtle differences between their assumptions. Nevertheless, 
values range much more for 2100 than for 2050.

4.2.3.4 
Changes in Extreme Sea Level events
ESL events are water level heights that consist of contributions from 
mean sea level, storm surges and tides. Compound effects of surges 
and tides are drivers of the ESL events. Section 4.2.3.4.1 discusses 
the combination of mean sea level change with a characterisation 
of the ESL events derived from tide gauges over the historical period 
and the sections 4.2.3.4.2 and 4.2.3.4.3 evaluate possible changes 
in these characteristics caused by cyclones and waves. This section 
discusses the importance of ESL and different modelling strategies to 
improve our understanding of ESL projections.
Even a small increase in mean sea level can signiﬁcantly augment 
the frequency and intensity of ﬂooding. This is because SLR elevates 
the platform for storm surges, tides, and waves, and because there is 
a log-linear relationship between a ﬂood’s height and its occurrence 
interval. Changes are most pronounced in shelf seas. Roughly 1.3% 
of the global population is exposed to a 1 in 100-year–1 ﬂood (Muis 
et al., 2016). This exposure to ESL and resulting damage could 
increase signiﬁcantly with SLR, potentially amounting to 10% of the 
global GDP by the end of the century in the absence of adaptation 
(Hinkel et al., 2014).
The frequency and intensity of ESL events can be estimated with 
statistical models or hydrodynamical models constrained by 
observations. Hydrodynamic models simulate a series of ESL events 
over time, which can then be ﬁtted by extreme value distributions 
to estimate the frequency and intensity (e.g. the return level of an 
event occurring with a period of 100 years or frequency of 0.01 yr–1, 
also called the 100-year event). A tide model is sometimes included 
and sometimes added ofﬂine to estimate the ESL events. Statistical 
models ﬁt tide gauge observations to extreme value distributions to 
directly estimate ESL events or combine probabilistic RSL scenarios 
with storm surge modelling. This can be done on global scale or 
local scale. For example, Lin et al. (2016) and Garner et al. (2017) 
estimate the increase in ﬂood frequency along the US east coast. 
Both of these modelling approaches can account for projections of 
SLR. Rasmussen et al. (2018) used a combination of a global network 
of tide gauges and a probabilistic localised SLR to estimate expected 
ESL events showing inundation reductions for different temperature 
stabilisation targets as shown in the SR15 report.
An advantage of the use of hydrodynamic models is that they can 
quantify interactions between the different components of ESL (Arns 
et al., 2013). Hydrodynamical models can be executed over the entire 
ocean with ﬂexible grids at a high resolution (up to 1/20ºor ~5 km) 
where necessary, appropriate for local estimates (Kernkamp et al., 
2011). Input for these models are wind speed and direction, and 
atmospheric pressure. Results of those models show that the Root 
Mean Squared Error between modelled and observed sea level is 
less than 0.2 m for 80% of a data set of 472 stations covering the 
global coastline (Muis et al., 2016) at 10-minute temporal resolution 
over a reference period from 1980–2011. This implies that for most 
locations it can be used to describe the variability in ESL. However, 
the areas where ESL is dominated by tropical storms are problematic 
for hydrodynamical models. Another difﬁculty arises when these 
models are forced with climate models: they inherit the limitations 
(resolution, precision and accuracy) of wind and pressure in climate 
projections, which is often insufﬁcient to describe the role of waves.
Statistical models have shown that the estimation of ESL is highly 
sensitive to the characterisation of SLR and ﬂood frequency 
distributions (Buchanan et al., 2017). This is conﬁrmed by Wahl et al. 
(2017) who estimate that the 5–95 percentile uncertainty range, 
attained through the application of different statistical extreme 
value methods and record lengths, of the current 100-year event is 
on average 40 cm, whereas the corresponding range in projected 
GMSL of AR5 under RCP8.5 is 37 cm. For ESL events with a higher 
return period, differences will be larger. Capturing changes in the ESL 
return periods in the future is even more complicated because both 
the changing variability over time and the uncertainty in the mean 
projection must be combined. A statistical framework to combine 
RSL and ESL, based on historical tide gauge data was applied to 
the US coastlines (Buchanan et al., 2016). Hunter (2012) and the 
AR5 (Church et al., 2013) projected changes in ﬂood frequency 
worldwide; however, these analyses used the Gumbel distribution 
for high water return periods, which implies that the frequency of 
all ESLs (e.g., whether the 1in 10-year or 1 in 500-year) will change 
by the same magnitude for a given RSL, an approximation that can 
underestimate or overestimate ESL (Buchanan et al., 2017). Hence, 
the ampliﬁcation factors of future storm return frequency in AR5 WGI 
Figure 13.25 may underestimate ﬂood hazards in some areas, while 
overestimating them in others. By using the Gumbel distribution, 
Muis et al. (2016) may also inadequately estimate ﬂood frequencies.
4.2.3.4.1 Relative sea level and extreme sea level events based  
on tide gauge records
Changes in ESL are presented here, based on the projections as 
presented in 4.2.3.2 at the tide gauge locations in the GESLA2 
database (Woodworth et al., 2016). Results include GIA effects, but 
anthropogenic subsidence is not prescribed. These calculations serve 
as a signal to guide adaption to SLR (Stephens et al., 2018). Return 
periods are calculated as a combination of regional RSL projections 
and a probabilistic characterisation of the variability in sea level as 
derived from the GESLA2 data set which contains a quasi-global 
set of tide gauges. By doing so, it is assumed that the variability in 
the tide gauge record does not change over time. Models are not 
accurate enough to address whether this is correct or not.
To quantify the average return period of ESL events, a peak-over-
threshold method is applied following Arns et al. (2013) and Wahl 
et al. (2017). Tide gauge records are detrended by subtracting a 
running mean of one year. Peaks above the 99th percentile of hourly 
water levels are extracted and declustered by applying a minimum 
time between peaks of 72 hours. This threshold of 99% was 
recommended by Wahl et al. (2017) for global applications. Using 
a maximum likelihood estimator, a Generalized Pareto Distribution 
(GPD) is ﬁtted to these peaks, allowing for an extrapolation to 
return periods beyond the available period of observations. Changes 
in ESL events due to regional mean SLR are quantiﬁed following 
Hunter (2010). Uncertainties in the GPD parameters and projections 
are propagated using a Monte Carlo approach, from which a best 
estimate is derived (see SM4.2). Only tide gauge records of 20 years

Figure 4.11 |  The relation between expected extreme sea level (ESL) events and return period at a set of characteristic tide gauge locations (see upper left for their 
location), referenced to recent past mean sea level, based on observations in the GESLA-2 data base (grey lines) and 2081–2100 conditions for three different RCP 
scenarios as presented in Section 4.2.3.2. The grey bands represent the 5–95% uncertainty range in the ﬁt of the extreme value distribution to observations. The upper right 
hand panel provides an example illustrating the relationship between ESL events and return period for historical and future conditions; the blue line in this panel shows 
the best estimate ESL event above the 1986–2005 reference mean sea level. The coloured lines for the different locations show this expected ESL events for different RCP 
scenarios. The horizontal line denoting the ampliﬁcation factor expresses the increase in frequency of events which historically have a return period of once every 100 years.  
In the example, a water level of 2.5 m above mean sea level, recurring in the recent climate approximately every 100 years in recent past climate, will occur every  
2 to 3 years under future climate conditions. The allowance expresses the increase in ESL for events that historically have a return period of 100 years.

of longer, which are at least 70% complete, are used. However, as 
can be seen for Guam (Fig 4.9), this does not ensure a good ﬁt of 
the GPD to all peaks, as rare events may have been captured in this 
relatively short record. 
Projected changes in ESL events are shown for 12 selected tide gauges 
in Figure  4.11. The magnitude of these changes depends on the 
relation between ESL events and the associated return periods, as well 
as regional sea level projections, and the uncertainty therein (see inset 
Figure 4.11). The change in ESL events is commonly expressed in terms 
of the ampliﬁcation factor and the allowance. The ampliﬁcation factor 
denotes the ampliﬁcation in the average occurrence frequency of a 
certain extreme event, often referenced to the water level with a 100-
year return period during the historic period. The allowance denotes 
the increased height of the water level with a given return period. This 
allowance equals the regional projection of SLR with an additional 
height related to the uncertainty in the projection (Hunter, 2012).
Ampliﬁcation factors are strongly determined by the local variability 
in ESL events. Locations where this variability is large due to large 
storm surges and astronomical tides (e.g., Cuxhaven, see Figure 4.9) 
will experience a relatively moderate ampliﬁcation of the occurrence 
frequency of extremes. In comparison, locations with small variability 
in ESL events (e.g., Lautoka and Papeete) will experience large 
ampliﬁcations even for a moderate rise in mean sea level (Vitousek 
et al., 2017). Globally, this contrast between regions with large 
and small ampliﬁcation factors becomes clear for projections by 
mid-century (Fig 4.11, left panels). Although regional differences 
in projected mean SLR are small for the coming centuries, regional 
contrasts in ampliﬁcation factors are considerable. In particular,

Figure 4.12 |  The colours of the dots express the factor by which the frequency of extreme sea level (ESL) events increase in the future for events which historically have 
a return period of 100 years. Hence a value of 50 means that what is currently 1-in-100 year event will happen every 2 years due to a rise in mean sea level. Results are 
shown for three RCP scenarios and two future time slices as median values. Results are shown for tide gauges in the GESLA2 database. The accompanying conﬁdence 
interval can be found in SM4.2 as well as a list of all locations. The data underlying the graph are identical to those presented in Figure 4.11. The ampliﬁcation factor is 
schematically explained in the upper right panel of ﬁgure 4.11. Storm climatology is constant in these projections.

many coastal areas in the lower latitudes may expect ampliﬁcation 
factors of 100 or larger by mid-century, regardless of the scenario 
as also shown in SR15 and Rasmussen et al. (2018). This indicates 
that, at these locations, water levels with return periods of 100 years 
during recent past will become annual or more frequent events by 
mid-century. By end-century and in particular under RCP8.5, such 
ampliﬁcation factors are widespread along the global coastlines 
(Vousdoukas et al., 2018a).
In summary, ESL events estimates as presented in this subsection, 
clearly show that as a consequence of SLR, events which are currently 
rare (e.g., with an average return period of 100 years), will occur 
annually or more frequently at most available locations for RCP8.5 
by the end of the century (high conﬁdence). For some locations, this 
change will occur as soon as mid-century for RCP8.5 and by 2100 for 
all emission scenarios. The affected locations are particularly located 
in low-latitude regions, away from the tropical cyclone (TC) tracks. 
In these locations, historical sea level variability due to tides and 
storm surges is small compared to projected mean SLR. Therefore, 
even limited changes in mean sea level will have a noticeable effect 
on ESLs, and for some locations, even RCP2.6 will lead to the annual 
occurrence of historically rare events by mid-century. Results should 
be treated with caution in regions where TCs are important as they 
are underrepresented in the observations (Haigh et al., 2014a).
4.2.3.4.2 Waves
A warming climate is expected to affect wind patterns and storm 
characteristics, which in turn will impact wind waves that contribute 
to high coastal water levels. Wind-wave projections are commonly 
based on dynamical and statistical wave models forced by projected 
surface winds from GCMs, notably those participating in the CMIP. 
In the framework of the Coordinated Ocean Wave Climate Project 
(COWCLIP), an ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 
Phase 3 (CMIP3)-based global wave projections (Hemer et al., 
2013) was produced and the results were summarised in the AR5 
(WGI Chapter 13). Casas-Prat et al. (2018) expanded the geographic 
domain to include the Arctic Ocean, highlighting the vulnerability of 
high-latitude coastlines to wave action as ice retreats. Reduced sea 
ice allows larger waves and stronger cyclones in the Arctic Ocean, 
which can further disrupt and break up sea ice (e.g., Thomson and 
Rogers, 2014; Day and Hodges, 2018). A review and consensus-based 
analysis of regional and global scale wave projections, including 
CMIP5-based projections, has been provided by Morim et al. (2018) 
as part of COWCLIP. Projections of annual and seasonal mean 
signiﬁcant wave height changes agree on an increase in the Southern 
Ocean, tropical eastern Paciﬁc and Baltic Sea; and on a decrease over 
the North Atlantic, northwestern Paciﬁc and Mediterranean Sea. 
Projections of mean signiﬁcant wave height lack consensus over 
the eastern North Paciﬁc and southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans. 
Projections of future extreme signiﬁcant wave height are consistent 
in projecting an increase over the Southern Ocean and a decrease 
over the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. Regional 
projections of wind-waves have mostly been applied to Europe so far, 
while highly vulnerable regions have been largely overlooked. This is 
the case for low-lying islands where impacts of SLR and wave-induced 
ﬂooding are expected to be severe and adaptive capacity is reduced 
(Hoeke et al., 2013; Albert et al., 2016).
A number of studies have included waves, in addition to tides and 
sea level anomalies, to assess coastal vulnerability to SLR using 
dynamical and statistical approaches. CoSMoS (Barnard et al., 
2014) includes a series of embedded wave models to estimate high 
resolution projections of total water levels along the Southern 
California coast for different extreme scenarios (O’Neill et al., 2017). 
Arns et al. (2017) ﬁnd that an increase in sea level may reduce the 
depth-limitation of waves, thereby resulting in waves with greater 
energy approaching the coast. Including wave effects is crucial for 
coastal adaptation and planning (e.g., Isobe, 2013). For example Arns 
et al. (2017) report that coastal protection design heights need to be 
increased by 48–56% in the German Bight region relative to a design 
height based on the effect of SLR on ESL only. Combining SLR with 
extreme value theory applied to past observations of tides, storm 
surges and waves, Vitousek et al. (2017) found that a 10–20 cm SLR 
could result in a doubling of coastal ﬂooding frequency in the tropics. 
For the southern North Sea region, Weisse et al. (2012) argue that 
increasing storm activity also increases hazards from ESL events. 
Global-scale projections of ESL event changes including wave setup 
indicate a very likely increase of the global average 100-year ESL 
of 58–172 cm under RCP8.5 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018c). Changes in 
storm surges and waves enhance the effects of relative SLR along the 
majority of northern European coasts, with contributions up to 40% 
in the North Sea (Vousdoukas et al., 2017).
A stationarity of the wave climate is often assumed for projections of 
ESL events (Vitousek et al., 2017). Yet, wave contributions to coastal 
sea level changes (setup and swash) depend on several factors that 
can vary in response to internal climate variability and climate change, 
including deep-water wave ﬁeld, water-depth, and geomorphology. 
Melet et al. (2018) reported that over recent decades, wave setup and 
swash interannual-to-decadal changes induced by deep-water wave 
height and period changes alone were sizeable compared to steric 
and land-ice mass loss coastal sea level changes. 
Comprehensive broad-scale projections of sea level at the coast 
including regional sea level changes, tides, waves, storm surges, 
interactions between these processes and accounting for changes in 
period and height of waves and frequency and intensity of storm 
surges are yet to be performed.
4.2.3.4.3 Effects of cyclones
Tropical and extratropical cyclones (TCs and ETCs) tend to determine 
ESL events, such as coastal storm surges, high water events, coastal 
ﬂoods, and their associated impacts on coastal communities around 
the world. The projected potential future changes in TCs and ETCs 
frequency, track and intensity is therefore of great importance. After 
AR5, it was realised that the modelled global frequency of TCs is 
underestimated and that the geographical pattern is poorly resolved 
in the case of TC tracks, very intense TCs (i.e.,  Category 4/5) and 
TC formation by using low resolution climate models (Camargo, 
2013). Over recent years, multiple methods including downscaling

CMIP5 climate models (Knutson et al., 2015; Yamada et al.,  
2017), high-resolution simulations (Camargo, 2013; Yamada 
et al., 2017), TC–ocean interaction (Knutson et al., 2015; 
Yamada et al., 2017), statistical models (Ellingwood and Lee, 2016) 
and statistical-deterministic models (Emanuel et al., 2008) have been 
developed, and the ability to simulate TCs has been substantially 
improved. Most models still project a decrease or constant global 
frequency of TCs, but a robust increase in the lifetimes, precipitation, 
landfalls and ratio of intense TCs under global warming. This is 
consistent with IPCC AR5 and many additional studies (Emanuel 
et al., 2008; Holland et al., 2008; Knutson et al., 2015; Kanada et al., 
2017; Nakamura et al., 2017; Scoccimarro et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 
2017). It is expected that these projected increases are intensiﬁed 
by favourable marine environmental conditions, expansion of the 
tropical belt, or ocean warming in the northwest Paciﬁc and north 
Atlantic, and increasing water vapour in the atmosphere (Kossin 
et al., 2014; Moon et al., 2015; Cai et al., 2016; Mei and Xie, 2016; 
Cai et al., 2017; Kossin, 2017; Scoccimarro et al., 2017; Kossin, 2018). 
However, it is noted that, in contrast to most models, some models 
do predict an increase in global TC frequency during the 21st century 
(Emanuel, 2013; Bhatia et al., 2018).
Previous extensive studies indicated the important role of warming 
oceans in the TC activity (Emanuel, 2005; Mann and Emanuel, 2006; 
Trenberth and Fasullo, 2007; Trenberth and Fasullo, 2008; Villarini 
and Vecchi, 2011; Trenberth et al., 2018) and also revealed TCs 
stir the ocean and mix the subsurface cold water to the surface 
(Shay et al., 1992; Lin et al., 2009). The resulting increased thermal 
stratiﬁcation of the upper ocean under global warming will reduce 
the projected intensiﬁcation of TCs (Emanuel, 2015; Huang et al., 
2015; Tuleya et al., 2016). A recent study suggests a strengthening 
effect of ocean freshening in TC intensiﬁcation, opposing the thermal 
effect (Balaguru et al., 2016). It is concluded that it is likely that the 
intensity of severe TCs will increase in a warmer climate, but there 
is still low conﬁdence in the frequency change of TCs in the future. 
Recent projection studies indicate that trends in regional ETCs 
vary from region to region, for example, a projected increase in the 
frequency of ETCs in the South and the northeast North Atlantic, the 
South Indian Ocean, and the Paciﬁc (Colle et al., 2013; Zappa et al., 
2013; Cheng et al., 2017; Michaelis et al., 2017) and a decrease in the 
numbers of ETCs in the North Atlantic basin and the Mediterranean 
(Zappa et al., 2013; Michaelis et al., 2017). Note that the projected 
frequency in ETCs still remains uncertain due to different deﬁnitions 
of cyclone, model biases or climate variability (Chang, 2014; Cheng 
et al., 2016). Considering these processes implies that changes in TC 
and ETC characteristics will vary locally and therefore there is low 
conﬁdence in the regional storm changes, which is in agreement with 
AR5 WGI Chapter 14 (Christensen et al., 2013).
Observed damages from ETCs/TCs to coastal regions has increased 
over the past 30 years and will continue in the future (Ranson 
et al., 2014). The global population exposed to ETCs/TCs hazards 
is expected to continue to increase in a warming climate (Peduzzi 
et al., 2012; Blöschl et al., 2017; Emanuel, 2017a; Michaelis et al., 
2017). The probabilities of sea level extreme events induced by TC 
storm surge are very likely to increase signiﬁcantly over the 21st 
century. Risk from TCs increases in highly vulnerable coastal regions 
(Hallegatte et al., 2013), e.g., on coasts of China (Feng and Tsimplis, 
2014), west Florida, north of Queensland, the Persian Gulf, and even 
in well protected area such as the Greater Tokyo area (Tebaldi et al., 
2012; Lin and Emanuel, 2015; Ellingwood and Lee, 2016; Hoshino 
et al., 2016; Dinan, 2017; Emanuel, 2017b; Lin and Shullman, 2017). 
The ESL return period has greatly decreased over recent decades and 
is also expected to decrease greatly in the near future, for example, 
in NYC (by 2030–2045; Garner et al., 2017). It is very likely that 
the ESL return period in low-lying areas such as coastal megacities 
decreased over the 20th century and frequencies of still unusual 
ESL events are expected to increase in frequency in the future. In 
addition, the compound effects of SLR, storm surge and waves on 
ESL events and the associated ﬂood hazard are assessed in Chapter 6 
(Section 6.3.3.3 and 6.3.4).
4.2.3.5 
Long-Term Scenarios, Beyond 2100
Sea level at the end of the century will be higher than present day 
and continuing to rise in all cases even if the Paris Agreement is 
followed (Nicholls, 2018). The reasons for this are mainly related to 
the slow response of glacier melt, thermal expansion and ice sheet 
mass loss (Solomon et al., 2009). These processes operate on long 
time scales, implying that even if the rise in global temperature slows 
or the trend reverses, sea level will continue to rise (SR1.5 report, 
AR5). A study by Levermann et al. (2013) based on palaeo-evidence 
and physical models formed the basis of the assessment by Church 
et al. (2013) indicating that committed SLR is approximately 
2.3 m per degree warming for the next 2000 years with respect to 
pre-industrial temperatures. This rate is based on a relation between 
ocean warming and basal melt as used by Levermann et al. (2013), 
without accounting for surface melt, hydrofracturing of ice shelves 
and subsequent ice cliff failure, suggested to be a dominant long 
term mechanism for ice mass loss (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Deep 
uncertainty (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1) remains on the ice 
dynamical contribution from Antarctica after 2100.
Beyond the 21st century, the relative importance of the long-term 
contributions of the various components of SLR changes markedly. 
For glaciers, the long-term is of limited importance, because the sea 
level equivalent of all glaciers is restricted to 0.32 ± 0.08 m when 
taking account of ice mass above present day sea level (Farinotti 
et al., 2019). Hence, there is high conﬁdence that the contribution 
of glaciers to SLR expressed as a rate will decrease over the 22nd 
century under RCP8.5 (Marzeion et al., 2012). For thermal expansion 
the gradual rate of heat absorption in the ocean will lead to a further 
SLR for several centuries (Zickfeld et al., 2017). By far, the most 
important uncertainty on long time scales arises from the contribution 
of the major ice sheets. The time scale of response of ice sheets is 
thousands of years. Hence, if ice sheets contribute signiﬁcantly to sea 
level in 2100, they will necessarily also contribute to sea level in the 
centuries to follow. Only for low emission scenarios, like RCP2.6, can 
substantial ice loss be prevented, according to ice dynamical models 
(Levermann et al., 2014; Golledge et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 
2016; Bulthuis et al., 2019). For Greenland, surface warming may lead 
362

4
to ablation becoming larger than accumulation, and the associated 
surface lowering increases ablation further (positive feedback). As 
a consequence, the ice sheet will signiﬁcantly retreat. Church et al. 
(2013) concluded that the threshold for perpetual negative mass 
balance based on modelling studies lies between 1ºC (Robinson 
et al., 2012; low conﬁdence) and 4ºC (medium conﬁdence) above 
pre-industrial temperatures. Pattyn et al. (2018) demonstrated that 
with more than 2.0ºC of summer warming, it becomes more likely 
than not that the GIS crosses a tipping point, and the ice sheet will 
enter a long-term state of decline with the potential loss of most or all 
of the ice sheet over thousands of years. If the warming is sustained, 
ice loss could become irreversible due to the initiation of positive 
feedbacks associated with elevation-SMB feedback (reinforced 
surface melt as the ice sheet surface lowers into warmer elevations), 
and albedo-melt feedback associated with darkening of the ice 
surface due to the presence of liquid water, loss of snow, changes in 
ﬁrn and biological processes (Tedesco et al., 2016; Ryan et al., 2018). 
The precise temperature threshold and duration of warming required 
to trigger such irreversible retreat remains very uncertain, and more 
research is still needed.
The mechanisms for decay of the AIS are related to ice shelf melt by 
the ocean, followed by accelerated loss of grounded ice and MISI, 
possibly exacerbated by hydrofracturing of the ice shelves and ice 
cliff failure (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). The latter processes 
have the potential to drive faster rates of ice mass loss than the 
SMB processes that are likely to dominate the future loss of ice 
on Greenland. Furthermore, the loss of marine-based Antarctic ice 
represents a long-term (millennial) commitment to elevated SLR, due 
to the long thermal memory of the ocean. Once marine based Antarctic 
ice is lost, local ocean temperatures will have to cool sufﬁciently 
for buttressing ice shelves to reform, allowing retreated grounding 
lines to re-advance (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). A minimum time 
scale, whereby the majority of West Antarctica decays, was derived 
from a schematic experiment with an ice ﬂow model by Golledge 
et al. (2017), where ice shelves were removed instantaneously and 
prohibited from re-growing. Results of this experiment indicate that 
most of West Antarctica’s ice is lost in about a century.
Gradual melt of ice shelves accompanied by partial retreat of East 
Antarctic ice would yield greater ice melt but on a time scale of 
millennial or longer (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). Prescribing 
a uniform warming of 2ºC–3ºC in the Southern Ocean triggers an 
accelerated decay of West Antarctica in a coarse resolution model 
with a temperature-driven basal melt formulation yielding 1–2  m 
SLR by the year 3000 and up to 4 m by the year 5000 (Sutter et al., 
2016). Formulating an ice sheet model with Coulomb friction in the 
grounding line zone yields a SLR of 2 m after 500 year for a sub-ice 
shelf melt of 20 m a–1 (Pattyn, 2017). On decadal to millennial time 
scales the interaction between ice and the solid Earth indicates the 
possibility of a negative feedback slowing retreat by viscoelastic 
uplift and gravitational effects that reduce the water depth at the 
grounding line (Gomez et al., 2010; de Boer et al., 2014; Gomez et al., 
2015; Konrad et al., 2015; Pollard et al., 2017; Barletta et al., 2018; 
Section 4.2.3.1.2).
A blended statistical and physical model, calibrated by observed 
recent ice loss in a few basins (Ritz et al., 2015) projects an Antarctic 
contribution to sea level of 30  cm by 2100 and 72  cm by 2200, 
following the SRES A1B scenario, roughly comparable to RCP6.0. 
The projected contribution of WAIS was found to be limited to 48 cm 
in 2200 following the A1B scenario. The key uncertainty in these 
calculations comes from the dependency on the relation between the 
sliding velocity and the friction at the ice-bedrock interface. Several 
parameterisations are used to describe this process. Golledge et al. 
(2015) present values between 0.6–3  m by 2300 for the RCP8.5 
scenario. In contrast to the previous studies, Cornford et al. (2015) 
used an adaptive grid model, which can describe more accurately 
grounding line migration (Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3). Due 
to the computational complexity of their model, simulations are 
limited to West Antarctica. Starting from present-day observations, 
they ﬁnd that the results are critically dependent on initial conditions, 
sub ice shelf melt rates, and grid resolution. The glacier with the 
most uncertain vulnerability is the 120  km-wide Thwaites Glacier, 
in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Thwaites Glacier is 
currently retreating in a reverse-sloped trough extending into the 
central WAIS (Figure 4.8), where the bed is up to 2 km below sea 
level. In addition to Thwaites, several smaller outlet glaciers and ice 
streams may contribute to sea level on long time scales, but in the 
study by Cornford et al. (2015), a full West Antarctic retreat does 
not occur with limited oceanic heating under the two major ice 
shelves (Filchner-Ronne and Ross) keeping ice streams ﬂowing into 
the Ross and Weddell Seas in place. However, the representation of 
these processes remains simplistic at the continental ice sheet scale 
(Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3).
Nonetheless, recent studies using independently developed Antarctic 
ice dynamical models (Golledge et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 
2016; Bulthuis et al., 2019) agree that low emission scenarios, are 
required to prevent substantial future ice loss (medium conﬁdence). 
However, observations (Rignot et al., 2014) and modelling of the 
Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica (Joughin et al., 2014), suggest 
grounding line retreat on the glacier’s reverse sloped bedrock is 
already underway and possibly capable of driving major WAIS 
retreat on century time scales. Whether the retreat is driven by ocean 
changes driven by climate change or by climate variability (Jenkins 
et al., 2018) is still under debate. Hence it is not possible to determine 
whether a low emission scenario would prevent substantial future 
ice loss (medium conﬁdence). This is a further elaboration on the 
SR15 assertion that the chance for passing a threshold is larger for 
2ºC warming than for 1.5ºC warming.
A study by Clark et al. (2016) addresses the evolution of the ice 
sheets over the next 10,000 years and concludes that given a climate 
model with an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.5ºC, the estimated 
combined loss of Greenland and Antarctica ranges from 25–52 m of 
equivalent sea level, depending on the emission scenario considered, 
with rates of GMSL as high as 2–4  m per century. A worst-case 
scenario was explored with an intermediate complexity climate 
model coupled to a dynamical ice model (Winkelmann et al., 2015), in 
which all readily available fossil fuels are combusted at present-day 
rates until they are exhausted. The associated climate warming leads 
to the disappearance of the entire AIS with rates of SLR up to around 
363

3 m per century. A follow up study by Clark et al. (2018) addressing 
the long-term commitment of SLR based on cumulative carbon 
dioxide emissions points to SLR as an additional measure for setting 
emission targets. It shows that a 2ºC scenario would result in 0.9 m 
in 2300 and around 7.4 m in the year 9000 CE.
Similar to the strategy for the 21st century, the long-term projections 
of sea level were assessed. Since no new CMIP runs are available 
there are no major new insights in the thermal expansion and 
glacier component which deviate from the AR5 assessment for the 
long-term contribution of these components. Some studies updated 
the contribution of the GIS on long time scales. Vizcaino et al. (2015) 
used a GCM coupled to an ice sheet model to calculate the Greenland 
contribution which is within the range of estimates presented by 
Church et al. (2013). This is also true for the ice sheet simulations 
by Calov et al. (2018) which are based on off line simulations with 
a regional climate model forced by RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of 
three different CMIP5 models. On the other hand, Aschwanden et al. 
(2019) used temperatures to calculate SMB which was used to force 
an ice sheet model to arrive at much higher values for SLR. However, 
they used a spatially uniform temperature forcing, which is in conﬂict 
with earlier work and overestimated temperatures in the ablation 
zone (e.g., Van de Wal and Wild, 2001; Gregory and Huybrechts, 
2006). Given this limited and contrasting evidence for Greenland, 
the assessed values presented in Table 13.8 of Church et al. (2013) 
were also used, but again replacing the Antarctic component by the 
assessed value from the process and climate scenario-based studies 
published after 2013. The low scenario in Table 13.8 of Church et al. 
(2013) without the Antarctic contribution was combined with the 
RCP2.6 estimates for Antarctica simulated by Golledge et al. (2015), 
the mean of the RCP2.6 simulations with and without time delay 
between global mean atmosphere and ocean temperature around 
Antarctica of Levermann et al. (2014), and the model results of 
Bulthuis et al. (2019). The medium scenario from Church et al. (2013) 
is combined with RCP4.5 results and the high scenario with RCP8.5. 
Results are shown in Figure  4.2, Section  4.1 and show a strong 
divergence of RSL rise over time, whereby the estimates in 2300 
range from about 1–2 m under RCP2.6 up to 2–5.5 m for RCP8.5.
The speciﬁc trajectories that will be followed may depend critically 
on if and when certain tipping points are reached. Most critical in 
that respect are presumably the tipping points corresponding (1) to 
the threshold where the ablation in Greenland becomes larger than 
the accumulation, causing an irreversible and nearly full retreat of 
the ice sheet; and (2) the thresholds for ice shelf stability in West 
Antarctica, which depend on surface melt and sub-ice melt, combined 
with uncertainties surrounding MISI and/or MICI. There is deep 
uncertainty about whether and when a tipping point will be passed. 
For RCP8.5, the chance of passing a tipping-point are considered to 
be substantially higher than for RCP2.6.
In summary, there is high conﬁdence in continued thermal expansion 
and the loss of ice from both the GIS and AIS sheets beyond 2100. 
A complete loss of Greenland ice contributing about 7  m to sea 
level over a millennium or more would occur for sustained GMST 
between 1ºC (low conﬁdence) and 4ºC (medium conﬁdence) above 
pre-industrial levels. Due to deep uncertainties regarding the dominant 
processes that could trigger a major retreat, there is low conﬁdence 
in the estimates of the contribution of the AIS beyond 2100, but our 
estimates (2.3–5.4 m in 2300) for RCP8.5 are considerably higher 
than presented in AR5. High-emission scenarios or exhaustion of 
fossil fuels over a multi-century period lead to rates of SLR as high 
as several metres per century in the long term (low conﬁdence). 
Low-emission scenarios lead to a limited contribution over 
multi-century time scales (high conﬁdence). Discriminating between 
1.5ºC and 2ºC scenarios in terms of long-term sea level change is not 
possible with the limited evidence. Hence, it is concluded that the 
SLR on millennial time scales is strongly dependent on the emission 
scenario followed. This, combined with the lack in predictability 
of the tipping points, indicates the importance of emissions 
mitigation for minimising the risk to low-lying coastlines and islands  
(high conﬁdence).
Box 4.1 |  Case Studies of Coastal Hazard and Response
This box illustrates current coastal ﬂood risk management and adaptation practices through four case studies from around the world, 
showing how current approaches could be reﬁned using the new seal level rise (SLR) projections of this report, as well as ﬁndings on 
adaptation options, decision making approaches and governance (called Practice Consistent with SROCC Assessment in Tables 1–3). 
In an effort to illustrate some of the diverse social-ecological settings in this report, the locations are Nadi in Fiji, the Nile delta in Egypt, 
New York and Shanghai. The latter two studies are framed as a comparison. For each case, Current Practice reﬂects understanding, 
policy planning, and implementation that existed prior to SROCC. Recent improvements in understanding documented in this chapter 
suggest that signiﬁcant, beneﬁcial changes in the basis for design and planning are feasible in each case for addressing future risk. 
Responding to Coastal Flooding and Inundation, Nadi, Fiji 
Hazards that contribute to riverine ﬂooding and coastal inundation for Nadi Town and the wider Nadi Basin are heavy rainfall, elevated 
sea levels and subsidence of the delta. People and built assets in the Nadi River ﬂoodplain are already being affected by climate 
change. Observed sea level shows an increase of 4 mm yr–1 over the period 1992–2018. Over the past 75 years, extreme rainfall 
events have become more frequent. Of the 84 ﬂoods which occurred in the Nadi River Basin since 1870, 54 were post 1980, with 
26 major ﬂoods since 1991 (Hay, 2017). In January 2009, large areas of Fiji were inundated by devastating ﬂoods which claimed 
at least 11 lives, left 12,000 people temporarily homeless and caused 54 million USD in damage. Worst hit was the Nadi area, with 
total damage estimated at 39 million USD (Hay, 2017). The increased frequency of ﬂooding is not all attributable to increases in sea 
level and extreme rainfall events. River channels have become ﬁlled with sediment over time, largely owing to deforestation of the

hinterland. Much of the mangrove fringe has been sacriﬁced for development of various kinds. The Nadi River Delta is subsiding, 
exacerbating the effects of SLR (Chandra and Gaganis, 2016). Various initiatives to help alleviate ﬂooding and inundation in the Nadi 
Basin have been proposed. These include both hard protection and engineering (e.g., ring dikes, river widening, bridge rebuilding, 
retarding basins, shortcutting tributaries, dams and diversion channels) and accommodation (e.g., early ﬂood warnings and improved 
land management practices in upper basin) measures (Box 4.1, Table 1). 
A Comparison of New York City and Shanghai Coastal Flood Adaptation Measures 
Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Typhoon Winnie (1997) are considered the largest recorded historical ﬂood events for New York City  
and Shanghai, respectively (Xian et al., 2018). Hurricane Sandy killed 55 people in New York City and neighbouring states and caused 
over 19 billion USD losses to New York City (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014). Typhoon Winnie killed more than 310 people and

caused damage exceeding 3.2 billion USD in China. Many dikes and ﬂoodwalls along coastal Shanghai and Zhejiang were breached 
by surge-driven ﬂoodwaters (Gu, 2005).
Past updates of the ﬂood defences in Shanghai occurred after extreme ﬂood events (i.e., typhoons in 1962, 1974 and 1981; Xian et al., 
2018). In contrast, the ﬂood tide of Hurricane Sandy stands out in the record at the Battery tide gauge. Unlike the numerous episodes of 
severe inundation experienced by Shanghai, NYC suffered relatively moderate consequences from individual events before Hurricane 
Sandy. This and other factors led to higher-standard ﬂood protection measures in Shanghai, such as sea walls designed to protect its 
coastlines and critical infrastructure in developed areas against a 200-year (0.005 annual chance) ﬂood level, and ﬂood walls with 
1000-year (0.001 annual chance) riverine ﬂood return level along the Huangpu River. New York City, on the other hand, has relatively 
low protection, consisting of sandy dunes (e.g., on Staten Island), vegetation (e.g., in Queens) and low-rise sea walls or bulkheads in 
lower Manhattan. Another reason why Shanghai has repeatedly updated its ﬂood protection while New York City failed to do so lies in 
their differing governance structures (Wei and Leung, 2005; Yin et al., 2011; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014), as well as rapid economic 
growth in China, providing funding for large-scale infrastructure (Zhang, 2003).
Since Hurricane Sandy in 2012, implementation of the ‘Big U’ project, a coastal protection system for lower Manhattan, has begun, 
and a variety of measures are planned, and some undertaken, to protect the subway system to a ﬂood level of 4.3 m above street level 
(Jacob Balter, 2017; MTA, 2017). Newly built critical facilities will be located outside the ﬂood zone and siting guidelines for publicly 
ﬁnanced projects in the current and future ﬂood zones have been tightened (New York City Mayor’s Ofﬁce of Recovery and Resiliency, 
2019). The degree to which these protection projects will be completed and the guidelines enforced remains uncertain. Home buyouts 
have enabled some permanent relocation away from hazardous areas, but relocation impacts on social networks and place-based ties 
hamper long-term recovery (Binder et al., 2019; Buchanan et al., 2019).

Exposure and vulnerability assessed for present day only; thus static, 
with no reference to drivers.
Exposure and vulnerability assessed for the present day and future time 
periods, with the projections taking into account both biophysical and human 
drivers, drawing on community-based assessments (Sections 4.3, 4.4.4.2).
Levels of Risk
Reﬂect current levels of risk, with no allowance for changes 
in climatic, biophysical or socioeconomic conditions.
Use risk scenarios reﬂecting the full suite of biophysical and socioeconomic 
changes over the life of the planned investment project, including their 
interactions (Section 4.4.4.3).
Response Options
Interventions based entirely on reducing current levels of risk, 
with the primary focus on hard protection measures to reduce 
ﬂood hazard.
Consider locally appropriate, sequenced mix of hard, soft and 
ecosystem-based measures to reduce risks expected to occur over the lifetime 
of the investment (Sections 4.4.2, 4.4.4.3).
Planning and 
Decision Making
Responses take a narrow ‘ﬂood control’ approach aimed at 
‘controlling’ single hazards, rather than managing the multiple 
and interacting risks in their broader contexts.
Take into account vulnerability and equity implications, and use 
community-based approaches (Section 4.4.5). Responses reﬂect a risk-based, 
ﬂexible design approach that addresses the tension between a ﬁxed design 
standard on the one hand and, on the other hand, increasing ﬂood risk over 
time due to further ﬂoodplain development, climate change leading to higher 
peak ﬂows and inundation, and river channel bed aggradation. 
Governance 
and Institutional 
Dimensions
Nadi Town Drainage Plan completed in August 2000. Aimed 
to address drainage problems and reduce ﬂood damage. 
However, the Plan was developed without distinction between 
inland water and river water, without hydraulic analysis and 
veriﬁcation, and without a scientiﬁc basis. Retention dams were 
constructed, but other initiatives in the plan have not seen 
substantive implementation.
A comprehensive ‘Flood Management Strategy and Plan’ for the Nadi River 
Basin would be one way to achieve the desired complementarity between 
hard, soft and accommodation measures. Strengthening of policies on water 
and land management, as well as addressing related legal and institutional 
issues, could be undertaken at the national, basin and local levels. 
Government, civil society, indigenous iTaukei Fijians, and the private sector, 
have valuable contributions to make in preparing an integrated approach 
to ﬂood and coastal hazard risk reduction (Section 4.4.5).

Climate Change Adaptation in Nile Delta Regions of Egypt
Coastal hazard for the Nile delta arises because large portions lie only ±1.5 m above sea level (Shaltout et al., 2015) and while the 
Delta includes only 2% of Egypt’s total area, it held 41% of its population as of 2006 (Hereher, 2010; World Bank, 2017) and is key 
to Egypt’s economy (Bucx et al., 2010). The delta is an important resource for Egypt’s ﬁsh farms (Hereher, 2009; El-Sayed, 2016) and 
contains more than 63% of Egypt’s cultivated lands (Hereher, 2010). The Nile Delta’s coastal lagoons are internationally renowned 
for abundant bird life, account for one fourth of Mediterranean wetlands and 60% of Egypt’s ﬁsh catch (Government of Egypt, 2016). 
Coastal ﬂooding and salinisation of freshwater lagoons would negatively affect ﬁsheries and biodiversity (UNDP, 2017). 
The Nile Delta’s low elevation translates into high exposure to SLR (Shaltout et al., 2015), and the level of protection varies greatly 
from place to place (Frihy et al., 2010). Box 4.1, Figure 1 indicates that episodic ﬂooding will increase substantially without effective 
adaptation measures. An estimated 2660 km2 in the northern delta will be inundated by 2100 for GMSL of 0.44 m (Gebremichael 
et al., 2018; low conﬁdence), which is comparable to the RCP2.6 emission scenario. In addition, subsidence due to sediment diversion 
by the Aswan High Dam, water and natural gas extraction (Gebremichael et al., 2018) and some other critical natural aspects (Frihy 
et al., 2010) heightens vulnerability to coastal ﬂooding (Box 4.1, Table 3) and reduces fresh water supply to the delta. Subsidence 
rates range from 0.4 mm yr–1 in the west delta to 1.1 mm yr–1 in the mid-delta and 3.4 mm yr–1 in the east delta (Elshinnawy et al., 
2010), although rates as high as 10 mm yr–1 near natural gas extraction operations are also reported (Gebremichael et al., 2018). 
While there is low conﬁdence in reported values, these indicate that subsidence makes locally a substantial contribution to RSL. Future 
construction of Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam (Stanley and Clemente, 2017) may heighten problems of fresh water availability 
and reduce hydropower production. 
The low-lying northern coast and Nile Delta region are a high priority for adaptation to climate change (UNDP, 2017). The Egyptian 
government has committed 200 million USD to hard coastal protection at Alexandria and adopted integrated coastal zone management 
for the northern coast. Recent activities include integrating SLR risks within adaptation planning for social-ecological systems, with special 
focus on coastal urban areas, agriculture, migration and other human security dimensions (Government of Egypt, 2016; UNDP, 2017).

 Exposure and Vulnerability
Current exposure and vulnerability considers topographic 
elevation and human drivers.
Exposure and vulnerability for current and future time periods would 
take into account projections that consider both biophysical and human 
drivers (Section 4.3.3).
Levels of Risk
Reﬂect current hazard plus various freeboard for NYC; 0.5 m 
for Shanghai, with no consideration of changes to date in 
storm characteristics and socioeconomic factors.
Use risk scenarios to reﬂect the full suite of climate change and socio-
economic changes and their interdependency for the planned coastal 
projects (Section 4.4.4.3); use freeboard that accounts for ESL uncer-
tainty, such as ESL with probability >5% during planning horizon.
Response Options
Protection measures: ﬁxed-height sea wall for both NYC and 
Shanghai; for NYC: building retroﬁt, ecosystem-based mea-
sures such as dune enhancement. Accommodation measures 
for NYC: insurance, building codes.
Consider locally appropriate, sequenced mix of hard protection, EbA, 
accommodation and retreat measures to minimise combined total costs; 
more ﬂexible design that reﬂects the dynamic risk (Section 4.4.2).
Planning and Decision 
Making
Funding and governance issues slow down long-term plan-
ning and implementation process, especially for NYC.
Flexible adaptation responses to uncertain long-term risk facilitate SLR 
planning and implementation (Section 4.4.4.3). Take into account vul-
nerability and equity implications, and continuously involve stakeholders 
in locally appropriate ways.
Governance and Institutional 
Dimensions
Shanghai has relatively high autonomy in China context 
and alignment of central and local Governments’ objectives; 
NYC’s decision making occurs in context of city-to-national 
multi-level governance. 
More effective coordination of planning, ﬁnance, and transparency 
among local, regional, and national government agencies, and between 
government, civil society, and the private sector, enables response to 
increasing risks (Section 4.4.5).

Exposure, Vulnerability, Impacts  
and Risk Related to Sea Level Rise
4.3.1 
Introduction 
Section 4.2 demonstrates that sea level is rising and accelerating over 
time, and that it will continue to rise throughout the 21st century and 
for centuries beyond. It also shows that ESL events that are historically 
rare, will become common by 2100 under all emission scenarios, leading 
to severe ﬂooding in the absence of ambitious adaptation efforts (high 
conﬁdence). In both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios, many 
low-lying coastal areas at all latitudes will experience such events 
annually by 2050. In this context, Section 4.3 updates knowledge on 
the recent methodological advances in exposure and vulnerability 
assessments (Box  4.2), dimensions of exposure and vulnerability 
(Section 4.3.2) and observed and projected impacts (Section 4.3.3). 
It concludes with a synthesis on future risks to illustrative low-lying 
coastal geographies (resource-rich coastal cities, urban atoll island, 
large tropical agricultural deltas and Arctic communities), and 
according to various adaptation scenarios (Section 4.3.4).

Exposure of coastal natural ecosystems to RSL and related coastal 
hazards change by two means: alterations in the spatial coverage 
and distribution of ecosystems within the potentially exposed 
area; and changes in the size of the exposed area caused by 
relative SLR. The vulnerability of coastal ecosystems to SLR and 
related coastal hazards differs strongly across ecosystem types 
and depends on human interventions (e.g.,  land use change and 
fragmentation, coastal squeeze and anthropogenic subsidence) and 
degradation (e.g., pollution), as well as climate change, including 
changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. SLR and its 
physical impacts, such as ﬂooding or salinisation, also increase 
ecosystems’ vulnerability and decrease the ecosystems’ ability to 
support livelihoods and provide ecosystem services such as coastal 
protection. Healthy, diverse, connected coastal ecosystems support

Full assessment of current and future exposure and vulnerability 
scenarios to account for interactions of changing demographic, industrial, 
and ecological characteristics of the Delta, especially with respect to 
agricultural land, ﬁsheries, and coastal cities (UNDP, 2017; Section 4.3).
Levels of Risk
Risk is high and has increased due to regional SLR and 
subsidence. (UNDP, 2017). Highly variable protection against 
current risk.
Use plausible risk scenarios, including regional sea level trends and 
possibly subsidence that could lead to higher ﬂood levels (UNDP, 2017) 
for potentially exposed and vulnerable communities. 
Response Options
Unconnected and small incremental steps toward increasing 
management capability in Egypt to confront coastal ﬂood risks 
associated with SLR, including enhancing planning paradigms, 
interventions that account for climate change threats, 
community-based measures, and adaptation and improving 
resilience (UNDP, 2017).
Consideration and deployment of a sequenced mix of tailor-made 
options, including hard protection, ecosystem-based measures, advance, 
and retreat. Comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness 
of measures. Timing of suitable options a key aspect (Section 4.4.4.3).
Planning and 
Decision Making
“One of the most prominent obstacles to integrated coastal 
zone management in Egypt is the complex and sometimes 
unclear institutional framework for addressing development 
activities; the limited and often ad-hoc approach between 
different agencies” (UNDP, 2017).
An adaptation based coastal planning approach able to manage 
the range of climatic risks on both natural and built environments 
that will cover hard protection (Ghoneim et al., 2015), accommodation 
and ecosystem-based measures (UNDP, 2017), involving potentially 
transformational approaches that take dynamic long term risk into 
account (UNDP, 2017; Sections 4.4.2, 4.4.4).
Governance and Institutional 
Dimensions
Some recent projects and proposals aim to “integrate the 
management of SLR risks into the development of Egypt’s Low 
Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) in the Nile Delta” (UNDP, 2017).
Mainstream long-term SLR risk into all elements of decision making 
that directly or indirectly affect the Nile Delta (4.4.5). Strengthen 
coordination of SLR-relevant provisions across scales, sectors and policy 
domains, including arrangements to involve government, civil society, 
science and the private sector (Section 4.4.5).

Box 4.2 |  Methodological Advances in Exposure and Vulnerability Assessments 
This box highlights recent advances in methodologies in assessing exposure and vulnerability to sea level rise (SLR) and its physical 
impacts, such as coastal ﬂooding since the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5). In few cases it also leverages methodological advances, 
which have not been yet applied in the coastal context but have great potential to inform coastal assessments.
Improved spatial-temporal exposure assessments
Exposure assessment is frequently based on census data, which is available at coarse resolutions. However, new technologies 
(e.g.,  drones and mobile phone data) and more available satellite products provide new tools for exposure analysis. Exposure 
assessment is increasingly based on the combination of high resolution satellite imagery and spatio-temporal population modelling 
as well as improved quality of digital elevation models (DEM; Kulp and Strauss, 2017). This is used to understand better exposure to 
coastal ﬂooding (Kulp and Strauss, 2017), diurnal differences in ﬂood risk exposure (Smith et al., 2016), dynamic gridded population 
information for daily and seasonal differences in exposure (Renner et al., 2017), a combination of remotely-sensed and geospatial 
data with modelling for a gridded prediction of population density at ~100 m spatial resolution (Stevens et al., 2015), or open building 
data using building locations, footprint areas and heights (Figueiredo and Martina, 2016). In addition, methods based on mobile 
phone data (Deville et al., 2014; Ahas et al., 2015), and social media-based participation are increasingly available for population 
distribution mapping (Steiger et al., 2015). Some of these methodologies have been already applied in coastal assessments (Smith 
et al., 2016). Integrating daily and seasonal changes with the distribution of population improves population exposure information for 
risk assessments especially in areas with highly dynamic population distributions, as shown in high tourism areas in mountain regions 
(e.g., Renner et al., 2017), which would have advantages at touristic coastal areas as well.
Projections of future exposure
Recent studies assess exposure considering not only projected sea levels but also expected changes in population size (Jongman et al., 
2012; Hauer et al., 2016). It involves different socioeconomic scenarios together with changing growth rates for coastal areas and 
the hinterland (Neumann et al., 2015) and using spatially explicit simulation models for urban, residential and rural areas (Sleeter 
et al., 2017). Migration-based changes in population distribution (Merkens et al., 2016; Hauer, 2017) are also considered, as well as 
simulated future land use (speciﬁcally urban growth) to investigate future exposure to SLR (Song et al., 2017). Other studies assess 
future exposure trends by accounting for the role of varying patterns of topography and development projections leading to different 
rates of anticipated future exposure (Kulp and Strauss, 2017), which inﬂuence how effectively coastal communities can adapt. Recent 
studies aim to account for the sociodemographic characteristics of potentially exposed future populations (Shepherd and Binita, 
2015), and anticipate future risk by projecting the evolution of the exposure of vulnerable populations and groups (Hardy and Hauer, 
2018). Using social heterogeneity modelling when developing future exposure scenarios enhances the quality of risk assessments 
in coastal areas (Rao et al., 2017; Hardy and Hauer, 2018). Subnational population dynamics combined with an extended coastal 
narrative-based version of the ﬁve shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) for global coastal population distribution was used for 
assessing global climate impacts at the coast, highlighting regions where high coastal population growth is expected and which 
therefore face increased exposure to coastal ﬂooding (Merkens et al., 2016). SSPs have also been used to estimate future population 
in regional coastal-hazard risk exposure studies (Vousdoukas et al., 2018b).
Advances in vulnerability assessment
Since the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters (SREX) report, vulnerability has been 
more  consistently considered in climate risk assessments (medium conﬁdence). It is recognised that climate risk is not only 
hazard-driven, but also a sociopolitical and economic phenomenon that evolves with changing societal and institutional conditions 
(high conﬁdence). Many studies related to climate risk and adaptation include vulnerability assessments, most of them considering 
vulnerability as a pre-existing condition while some interpret vulnerability as an outcome (Jurgilevich et al., 2017). 
Increasing importance of dynamic assessments
The dynamic nature of vulnerability, and the need to align climate forecasts with socioeconomic scenarios, was a key message of 
IPCC SREX. Challenges in methodology and data availability, particularly of future socioeconomic data is overcome by extrapolating 
empirical information of past trends in vulnerability to ﬂooding (Jongman et al., 2015; Mechler and Bouwer, 2015; Kreibich et al., 
2017), downscaling global scenarios, for example, the SSPs (Van Ruijven et al., 2014; Viguié et al., 2014; Absar and Preston, 2015), 
or by using participatory methods, surveys and interviews to develop future scenarios (Ordóñez and Duinker, 2015; Tellman et al., 
2016). The uncertainty of the downscaled projections needs to be considered along with the limitation that, even if population 
data projections are available, the future level of education, poverty, etc. is hard to predict (Jurgilevich et al., 2017). Suggestions 
to overcome these shortcomings entail the use of a combination of different data sources for triangulation and inclusion of 
uncertainties (Hewitson et al., 2014), or the meaningful involvement of stakeholders to project plausible future socioeconomic

local adaptation to SLR and its consequences (high conﬁdence). This 
section explores new knowledge since AR5 regarding changes in 
ecosystem’s exposure and vulnerability as well as processes affecting 
the ability of ecosystems to adapt to SLR, and associated impacts, 
such as ﬂooding or salinisation, on coastal social-ecological systems 
and coast-dependent livelihoods.
Changes in the exposure of coastal ecosystems
The effects of coastal habitat loss on ecosystem exposure are well 
documented (Lavery et al., 2013; Serrano et al., 2014; Short et al., 
2014; Yaakub et al., 2014; Cullen-Unsworth and Unsworth, 2016; 
Breininger et al., 2017), and depend on the type of ecosystem, 
its conservation status, and interactions with SLR and human 
interventions such as coastal squeeze, which prevents inland 
migration (Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; Schile et al., 2014; Hopper 
and Meixler, 2016). For instance, coastal habitat loss due to human 
growth and encroachment due to development, and human 
structures that restrict tides and, thus, interrupt mass ﬂow processes 
(water, nutrients and sediments) impact tidal ecosystems depending 
on the type of restriction, its severity and the geomorphology of 
the system (Burdick and Roman, 2012). Coastal dunes, for example, 
although threatened, are well maintained by protected areas in some 
localities, like Italy, but climate change could cause a drastic drop in 
their protection (Prisco et al., 2013). In addition, seagrass and other 
benthic ecosystems, for example, are declining across their range 
at unprecedented rates (Telesca et al., 2015; Unsworth et al., 2015; 
Samper-Villarreal et al., 2016; Balestri et al., 2017), due to degrading 
water quality (i.e.,  increased nutrient and sediment or dissolved

conditions through co-production (Jurgilevich et al., 2017). Recent innovations in (ﬂood) risk assessment include the integration of 
behaviour into risk assessments (Aerts et al., 2018b) as well as vulnerabilities related to cascading events (Serre and Heinzlef, 2018). 
Social-ecological vulnerability assessments
Especially in rural, natural resource-dependent settings, where the population directly rely on the services provided by ecosystems, the 
vulnerability of the ecosystems (e.g., fragmented, degraded ecosystems with low biodiversity) directly inﬂuence that of the population. 
Since AR5, several methods have been developed and piloted to assess and map social-ecological vulnerability. Examples include 
the use of i) the sustainable livelihood approach and resource dependence metrics for Australian coastal communities (Metcalf 
et al., 2015), ii) integration of local climate forecasts for coral reef ﬁsheries in Papua New Guinea (Maina et al., 2016), iii) ecosystem 
supply-demand model for an integrated vulnerability assessment in Rostock, Germany (Beichler, 2015), iv) participatory indicator 
development for multiple hazards in river deltas (Hagenlocher et al., 2018), and v) human-nature dependencies and ecosystem 
services for small-scale ﬁsheries in French Polynesia (Thiault et al., 2018). Areas, where social vulnerability prevail may be, but are not 
necessarily associated with hotspots of ecosystem vulnerability, highlighting the need to speciﬁcally adapt management interventions 
to local social-ecological settings and to adaptation goals (Hagenlocher et al., 2018; Thiault et al., 2018). The number of assessments 
considering both the social and the ecological part of the system are increasingly used (Sebesvari et al., 2016).
Assessment of vulnerability to multiple hazards simultaneously
Increasingly, multi-hazard risk assessments are undertaken at the coast (e.g., ﬂooding and inundation of coastal lands in India; Kunte 
et al., 2014), to understand the inter-relationships between hazards (e.g., Gill and Malamud, 2014), and by focusing on hazard 
interactions where one hazard triggers another or increases the probability of others occurring. Liu et al. (2016a) provide a systematic 
hazard interaction classiﬁcation based on the geophysical environment that allows for the consideration of all possible interactions 
(independent, mutex, parallel and series) between different hazards, and for the calculation of the probability and magnitude of 
multiple interacting natural hazards occurring together. Advances have been reported since AR5 by using, for example, modular sets 
of vulnerability indicators, ﬂexibly adapting to the hazard situation (Hagenlocher et al., 2018).
Using vulnerability functions, thresholds, innovative ways of aggregation in indicator-based assessment,  
improved data sources
The use of vulnerability functions has been shown to be helpful in assessing the damage response of buildings to tsunamis (Tarbotton 
et al., 2015), to coastal surge and wave hazards (Hatzikyriakou and Lin, 2017) and accounting for non-linear relationships between 
mortality and temperature above a ‘comfort temperature’ (El-Zein and Tonmoy, 2017). Acknowledging the non-compensatory nature 
of different vulnerability indicators (e.g., proximity to the sea cannot always be fully compensated by being wealthy), the concepts 
of preference, indifference and dominance thresholds have been applied as a form of data aggregation (Tonmoy and El-Zein, 2018). 
Similar to advances in exposure assessments, freely available data and mobile technologies hold promise for enabling better input 
data for vulnerability assessments. Examples include using a combination of mobile phone and satellite data to determine and 
monitor vulnerability indicators such as poverty (Steele et al., 2017), and using data on subnational dependency ratios and high 
resolution gridded age/sex group datasets (Pezzulo et al., 2017).

organic carbon loads) from upland-based activities, which include 
deforestation, agriculture, aquaculture, ﬁshing, and urbanisation, 
port development, channel deepening, dredging and anchoring of 
boats (Saunders et al., 2013; Ray et al., 2014; Deudero et al., 2015; 
Abrams et al., 2016; Benham et al., 2016; Mayer-Pinto et al., 2016; 
Thorhaug et al., 2017). The exact magnitude of area loss is still 
uncertain, especially at smaller scales (Yaakub et al., 2014; Telesca 
et al., 2015) and the implications of habitat shifts for ecosystem 
attributes and processes, and the services they deliver, remain poorly 
understood (Ray et al., 2014; Tuya et al., 2014). 
Changes in the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems
Global and local-scale processes inﬂuence the stability of coastal 
ecosystems and can interact to restrict ecosystem responses to SLR, 
and thus increase their vulnerability. At the global scale, changes in 
precipitation and air temperature represent a potentially signiﬁcant 
risk that increases the vulnerability of ecosystems to SLR and 
related hazards (Garner et al., 2015; Osland et al., 2017). Maximum 
temperature and mean precipitation change over the last 100 years 
are main drivers of global ecosystem instability (Mantyka-Pringle 
et al., 2013), with marked regional and local variations. In addition, 
seawater warming may affect marine communities and ecosystems 
but research remains sparse and results are contradictory (Crespo 
et al., 2017; Hernán et al., 2017). The synergistic effects between 
climate change and habitat loss due to human impact and urban 
development are increasingly well-documented but the effects are 
still not well-known at larger spatial and temporal scales (Kaniewski 
et al., 2014; Sherwood and Greening, 2014). Although evidence 
is limited, recurrent disturbances may lead to losses in ecosystem 
adaptive capacity (Villnäs et al., 2013). 
At smaller scales, conversion of coastal areas to urban, agricultural and 
industrial uses exacerbates pressure on ecosystems, increases their 
vulnerability to natural hazards, including SLR, and decreases their 
ability to support coastal livelihoods and deliver ecosystem services, 
such as coastal protection, ﬁsheries, wildlife habitat, recreational use 
and tourism (high conﬁdence; Foster et al., 2017). The vulnerability of 
exposed ecosystems is highly variable, as shown in intertidal rocky 
reef habitats in Australia (high conﬁdence; Thorner et al., 2014). Even 
without SLR, the transition zone between two coastal ecosystems and 
adjacent uplands responds dynamically and rapidly to interannual 
changes in inundation, with local factors, such as management of 
water control structures, outweighing regional ones (Wasson et al., 
2013). The resulting interaction of these variables and dynamics with 
fragmentation, land use planning and management (Richards and 
Friess, 2017) has only recently been investigated.
Research to date has focused on identifying synergisms among 
stressors (Campbell and Fourqurean, 2014; Lefcheck et al., 2017; 
Moftakhari et al., 2017; Noto and Shurin, 2017), but antagonisms 
and other feedbacks may be just as common (Brown et al., 2013; 
Conlisk et al., 2013; Maxwell et al., 2015; Crotty et al., 2017), and 
are seldom investigated, as is also true for thresholds and tipping 
points in coastal ecosystem stability and vulnerability (Connell et al., 
2017; O’Meara et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017). This precludes complete 
understanding of their complex responses, which may be greater 
than additive responses alone (Crotty et al., 2017), their adequate 
management, or restoration regimes (Maxwell et al., 2015; Unsworth 
et al., 2015). Furthermore, although local management efforts 
cannot prevent severe climate change impacts on ecosystems, they 
can attempt to slow down adverse impacts, and allow the degree of 
evolutionary adaptation that is feasible given the trajectory of global 
GHG emission reductions (Brown et al., 2013). 
In contrast, ecosystems with strong physical inﬂuences controlling 
elevation (sediment accretion and subsidence), even where mangrove 
replacement of salt marsh is expected, do not show changes in their 
vulnerability to SLR (McKee and Vervaeke, 2018), suggesting strong 
resilience of some coastal ecosystems. In areas such as South Florida, 
the wider Caribbean and the India-Paciﬁc mangrove region (Lovelock 
et al., 2015), however, mangroves cannot outpace current SLR rates, 
and are at risk of disappearing. These regional and local effects are 
highly variable (even contradictory between studies; e.g.,  Smoak 
et al., 2013; Koch et al., 2015) and are related to local conditions 
shaping vulnerability such as topography and controls over salinity 
from freshwater and inputs (Flower et al., 2017), but further research 
on the mass and surface energy balance is needed (Barr et al., 2013). 
In addition, the responses and behaviour of private landowners, who 
could impede landward migration of ecosystems, is incipient, but 
needs to be taken into account in assessing the ability of coastal 
ecosystems to respond to climate change (Field et al., 2017). Overall, 
the long-term resilience of some coastal vegetation communities, 
and their ability to respond to rapid changes in sea level, is not well 
developed (Foster et al., 2017).
In summary, coastal ecosystems’ with responses to SLR around the 
globe are complex and variable, with many speciﬁc responses at the 
ecosystem level or from keystone (foundation) species remaining 
poorly understood (Thompson et al., 2015). Moreover, responses are 
studied independently when holistic approaches may be required 
to understand how multiple threats affect ecosystem components, 
structure and functions (Giakoumi et al., 2015), and how human 
behaviour enables or constrains ecosystem responses to climate 
change (Field et al., 2017). In addition to the intrinsic coastal 
ecosystem values at stake, increasing exposure and vulnerability 
of these ecosystems contributes to increasing human exposure and 
vulnerability to SLR (medium evidence, high agreement; Arkema 
et al., 2013).
4.3.2.1.2 Point of departure on the human dimensions 
The 2012 Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and 
Disasters (SREX) acknowledged that patterns of human development 
create and compound exposure and vulnerability to climate-related 
hazards, including SLR (high conﬁdence). The recent IPBES report also 
discusses the role of anthropogenic drivers in biodiversity loss (Díaz 
et al., 2019). Climate change-focussed studies have progressively 
moved from the analysis of various parameters’ inﬂuence taken 
individually (education, poverty, etc.) to a more systemic approach that 
describes combinations of parameters, e.g., coastal urbanisation and 
settlement patterns (see Section 4.3.2.2) resulting from urban-rural 
discrepancies and trends in sociopolitical and economic inequalities. 
The AR5 also started differentiating between contemporary and 
historically-rooted drivers (e.g., trends in social systems over recent 
371
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4
4
decades; Marino, 2012; Duvat et al., 2017; Fawcett et al., 2017), 
and reported some progress in the development of context-speciﬁc 
studies, especially on coastal megacities, major deltas and small 
islands (Cross-Chapter Box 9, Box 4.1). 
AR5 also concluded with very high conﬁdence that both RSL rise 
and related impacts are inﬂuenced by a variety of local social and/
or environmental processes unrelated to climate (e.g., anthropogenic 
subsidence, glacial isostatic adjustment, sediment supply and 
coastal squeeze). Some of these processes are partly attributable as 
anthropogenic drivers, and although they may or may not be directly 
related to RSL rise, they do cause changes in coastal ecosystem 
habitat connectivity and ecosystem health conditions, for instance, 
and consequently inﬂuence the ability of coastal social-ecological 
systems as a whole to cope with and adapt to SLR and its impacts. 
However, the scientiﬁc literature still barely deals with the 
exposure and vulnerability of social-ecological systems to SLR 
speciﬁcally. Papers predominantly analyse the immediate and 
delayed consequences of extreme events such as TCs, storms and 
distant swells (see Section  6.3.3), for instance, and the resulting 
exposure and vulnerability ‘in the context of SLR’ (Woodruff et al., 
2013). One reason for this touches on the difﬁculty for society to 
fully comprehend and for science to fully analyse long-term gradual 
changes like SLR (Fincher et al., 2014; Oppenheimer and Alley, 2016; 
Elrick-Barr et al., 2017). Consequently, Sections 4.3.2.2 to 4.3.2.5 
concentrate on highlighting the anthropogenic or systemic drivers 
that have the potential to inﬂuence exposure and vulnerability to 
slow-onset sea level related hazards.
4.3.2.2 
Settlement Trends 
Major changes in coastal settlement patterns have occurred in the 
course of the 20th century, and are continuing to take place due to 
various complex interacting processes (Moser et al., 2012; Bennett 
et al., 2016) that together conﬁgure and concentrate exposure and 
vulnerability to climate change and SLR along the coast (Newton 
et al., 2012; Bennett et al., 2016). These processes include population 
growth and demographic changes (Smith, 2011; Neumann et al., 
2015), urbanisation and a rural exodus, tourism development, and 
displacement or (re)settlement of some indigenous communities 
(Ford et al., 2015). This has resulted in a growing number of people 
living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ, coastal areas below 
10 m of elevation; around 11% of the world’s population in 2010; 
Neumann et al., 2015; Jones and O’Neill, 2016; Merkens et al., 2016) 
and in signiﬁcant infrastructure and assets being located in risk-prone 
areas (high conﬁdence). High density coastal urban development 
is commonplace in both developed and developing countries, as 
documented in recent case studies, for example in Canada (Fawcett 
et al., 2017), China (Yin et al., 2015; Lilai et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016), 
Fiji (Hay, 2017), France (Genovese and Przyluski, 2013; Chadenas 
et al., 2014; Magnan and Duvat, 2018), Israel (Felsenstein and Lichter, 
2014), Kiribati (Storey and Hunter, 2010; Duvat et al., 2013), New 
Zealand (Hart, 2011) and the USA (Heberger, 2012; Grifman et al., 
2013; Liu et al., 2016b). This has implications for levels of SLR risk 
at regional and local scales (medium evidence, high agreement). In 
Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, it is estimated that 
6–8% of the population live in areas that are at high or very high 
risk of being affected by coastal hazards (Reguero et al., 2015; 
Calil et al., 2017; Villamizar et al., 2017), with higher percentages 
in Caribbean islands (Mycoo, 2018). In the Paciﬁc, ~57% of Paciﬁc 
Island countries’ built infrastructure are located in risk-prone coastal 
areas (Kumar and Taylor, 2015). In Kiribati, due to the ﬂow of outer, 
rural populations to limited, low-elevated capital islands, together 
with constraints inherent in the sociocultural land tenure system, the 
built area located <20 m from the shoreline quadrupled between 
1969 and 2007–2008 (Duvat et al., 2013). Other examples of rural 
exodus are reported in the recent literature, for example in the 
Maldives (Speelman et al., 2017). 
Population densiﬁcation also affects rural areas’ exposure and 
vulnerability, and interacts with other factors shaping settlement 
patterns, such as the fact that ‘indigenous peoples in multiple 
geographical contexts have been pushed into marginalised 
territories that are more sensitive to climate impacts, in turn limiting 
their access to food, cultural resources, traditional livelihoods and 
place-based knowledge (…) [and therefore undermining] aspects of 
social-cultural resilience’ (Ford et al., 2016b, p. 350). In the Paciﬁc, 
for example, ‘while traditional settlements on high islands (…) were 
often located inland, the move to coastal locations was encouraged 
by colonial and religious authorities and more recently through the 
development of tourism’ (Ballu et al., 2011; Nurse et al., 2014, p. 
1623; Duvat et al., 2017). Although these population movements 
are orders of magnitude smaller than the global trends described 
above, they play a critical role at the very local scale in explaining 
the emergence of, or changes in exposure and vulnerability. In atoll 
contexts, for example, the growing pressure on freshwater resources 
together with a loss in local knowledge (e.g., how to collect water 
from palm trees), result in increased exposure of communities to 
brackish, polluted groundwater, inducing water insecurity and health 
problems (Storey and Hunter, 2010; Lazrus, 2015). 
4.3.2.3 
Terrestrial Processes Shaping Coastal Exposure 
and Vulnerability
Coastal areas, including deltas, are highly dynamic as they are 
affected by natural and/or human-induced processes locally or 
originating from both the land and the sea. Changes within the 
catchment can therefore have severe consequences for coastal 
areas in terms of sediment supply, pollution, and/or land subsidence. 
Sediment supply reaching the coast is a critical factor for delta 
sustainability (Tessler et al., 2018) and has declined drastically in the 
last few decades due to dam construction, land use changes and 
sand mining (Ouillon, 2018; high conﬁdence). For instance, Anthony 
et al. (2015) reported large-scale erosion affecting over 50% of the 
delta shoreline in the Mekong delta between 2003 and 2012, which 
was attributed in part to a reduction in surface-suspended sediments 
in the Mekong river potentially linked to dam construction within the 
river basin, sand mining in the river channels, and land subsidence 
linked to groundwater over-abstraction locally. Schmitt et al. (2017) 
demonstrated that these and other drivers in sediment budget 
changes can have severe effects on the very physical existence of

the Mekong delta by the end of this century, with the most important 
single driver leading to inundation of large portions of the delta 
being ground-water pumping induced land subsidence. Thi Ha et al. 
(2018) estimated the decline in sediment supply to the Mekong delta 
to be around 75% between the 1970s and the period 2009–2016. 
In the Red River, the construction of the Hoa Binh Dam in the 1980s 
led to a 65% drop in sediment supply to the sea (Vinh et al., 2014). 
Based on projections of historical and 21st century sediment delivery 
to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mahanadi and Volta deltas, 
Dunn et al. (2018) showed that these deltas fall short in sediment 
and may not be able to maintain their current elevation relative to 
sea level, suggesting increasing salinisation, erosion, ﬂood hazards 
and adaptation demands. 
Another rarely considered factor is the shift in TC climatology which 
also plays a critical role in explaining changes in ﬂuvial suspended 
sediment loads to deltas as demonstrated by Darby et al. (2016), again 
for the Mekong delta. More generally, most conventional engineering 
strategies that are commonly employed to reduce ﬂood risk (including 
levees, sea walls, and dams) disrupt a delta’s natural mechanisms for 
building land. These approaches are rather short-term solutions which 
overall reduce the long-term resilience of deltas (Tessler et al., 2015; 
Welch et al., 2017). Systems particularly prone to ﬂood risk due to 
anthropogenic activities include North America’s Mississippi River 
delta, Europe’s Rhine River delta, and deltas in East Asia (Renaud et al., 
2013; Day et al., 2016). In regions where suspended sediments are 
still available in relatively large quantities, rates of sedimentation can 
vary depending on multiple factors, including the type of infrastructure 
present locally, as was shown by Rogers and Overeem (2017) for the 
Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (Bengal) delta in Bangladesh as well 
as seasonal differences in sediment supply and place of deposition. 
For example, in meso-tidal and macro-tidal estuaries, during ﬂoods 
most of the sediments are depositing in the coastal zones and a large 
part of these sediments are brought back to the estuary during the 
low ﬂow season by tidal pumping. This can lead to signiﬁcantly higher 
deposition rates in the dry season as shown by Lefebvre et al. (2012) 
in the lower Red River estuary and by Gugliotta et al. (2018) in the 
Mekong delta. Enhanced sedimentation further upstream in estuaries 
and a silting-up of estuarine navigation channels can have high 
economic consequences for cities with a large estuarine harbour. In 
Haiphong city, in North Vietnam, the authorities decided to build a 
new harbour further downstream, for a cost estimated at 2 billion USD 
(Duy Vinh et al., 2018).
Overall, reduced freshwater and sediment inputs from the river 
basins are critical factors determining delta sustainability (Renaud 
et al., 2013; Day et al., 2016). In some contexts, this can be addressed 
through basin-scale management which allow more natural ﬂows 
of water and sediments through the system, including methods 
for long-term ﬂood mitigation such as improved river-ﬂoodplain 
connectivity, the controlled redirection of a river (i.e.,  avulsions) 
during times of elevated sediment loads, the removal of levees, and 
the redirection of future development to lands less prone to extreme 
ﬂooding (Renaud et al., 2013; Day et al., 2016; Brakenridge et al., 
2017). These actions could potentially increase the persistence of 
coastal landforms in the context of SLR. Next to decreasing sediment 
inputs to the coast, river bed and beach sand mining has been shown 
to contribute to shoreline erosion, for example, for shorelines of Crete 
(Foteinis and Synolakis, 2015), and several sub-Saharan countries 
such Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa and Tanzania 
(UNEP, 2015). At the global scale, 24% of the world’s sandy beaches 
are eroding at rates exceeding 0.5 m yr–1, while 28% are accreting 
for the period 1984–2016. The largest and longest eroding sandy 
coastal stretches are in North America (Texas; Luijendijk et al., 2018).
Shoreline erosion leads to coastal squeeze if the eroding coastline 
approaches ﬁxed and hard built or natural structures as noted in 
AR5 (Pontee, 2013; Wong et al., 2014), a process to which SLR also 
contributes (Doody, 2013; Pontee, 2013). The AR5 further noted that 
coastal squeeze is expected to accelerate due to rising sea levels 
(Wong et al., 2014). Doody (2013) characterised coastal squeeze as 
coastal habitats being pushed landward through the effects of SLR 
and other coastal processes on the one hand and, on the other hand, 
the presence of static natural or artiﬁcial barriers effectively blocking 
this migration, thereby squeezing habitats into an ever narrowing 
space. Distinctions are made between coastal squeeze being limited 
to (1) the consequences of SLR vs. other environmental changes on 
the coastline and (2) the presence of only coastal defence structures 
vs. natural sloping land or other artiﬁcial infrastructure (Pontee, 
2013). Recent publications have emphasised coastal squeeze related 
to SLR, although inland infrastructure blocking habitat migration 
is not necessarily limited to defence structures (Torio and Chmura, 
2015; McDougall, 2017). Coastal ecosystem degradation by human 
activities leading to coastal erosion is also an important consideration 
(McDougall, 2017). Taking into consideration the current challenges 
to attribute coastal impacts to SLR (Section  4.3.3.1), it can be 
hypothesised here that as long as SLR impacts remain moderate, the 
dominant driving factor of coastal squeeze will be anthropogenic 
land-based development (e.g.,  Section  4.3.2.2). With higher SLR 
scenarios and in the case of no further development at the coast, 
SLR may become the dominant driver before the end of this century.
Preserved coastal habitats can play important roles in reducing risks 
related to some coastal hazards and initiatives are being put in place 
to reduce coastal squeeze, such as managed realignment (Sections 
4.1, 4.4.3.1) which includes removing inland barriers (Doody, 2013). 
Coastal squeeze can lead to degradation of coastal ecosystems and 
species (Martínez et al., 2014), but if inland migration is unencumbered, 
observation data and modelling have shown that the net area of coastal 
ecosystems could increase under various scenarios of SLR, depending 
on the ecosystems considered (Torio and Chmura, 2015; Kirwan 
et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016). However, recent modelling research 
has shown that rapid SLR in a context of coastal squeeze could be 
detrimental to the areal extent and functionality of coastal ecosystems 
(Mills et al., 2016) and, for marshes, could lead to a reduction of habitat 
complexity and loss of connectivity, thus affecting both aquatic and 
terrestrial organisms (Torio and Chmura, 2015). Contraction of marsh 
extent is also identiﬁed by Kirwan et al. (2016) when artiﬁcial barriers 
to landward migration are in place. Adaptation to SLR therefore needs 
to account for both development and conservation objectives so 
that trade-offs between protection and realignment that satisfy both 
objectives can be identiﬁed (Mills et al., 2016).

In summary, catchment-scale changes have very direct impacts on 
the coastline, particularly in terms of water and sediment budgets 
(high conﬁdence). The changes can be rapid and modify coastlines 
over short periods of time, outpacing the effects of SLR and leading 
to increased exposure and vulnerability of social-ecological systems 
(high conﬁdence). Without losing sight of this fact, management of 
catchment-level processes contribute to limiting rapid increases in 
exposure and vulnerability. Further to hinterland inﬂuences, coastal 
squeeze increases coastal exposure as well as vulnerability by the 
loss of a buffer zone between the sea and infrastructure behind 
the habitat undergoing coastal squeeze. The clear implication is 
that coastal ecosystems progressively lose their ability to provide 
regulating services with respect to coastal hazards, including as 
a defence against SLR driven inundation and salinisation (high 
conﬁdence). Vulnerability is also increased if freshwater resources 
become salinised, particularly if these resources are already scarce. 
The exposure and vulnerability of human communities is exacerbated 
by the loss of other provisioning, supporting and cultural services 
generated by coastal ecosystems, which is especially problematic for 
coast-dependent communities (high conﬁdence). 
4.3.2.4 
Other Human Dimensions 
The development of local scale case studies from a social science 
perspective, for example, in the Arctic (Ford et al., 2012; Ford 
et al., 2014), small islands (Petzold, 2016; Duvat et al., 2017) and 
within cities (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014; Paterson et al., 2017; 
Texier-Teixeira and Edelblutte, 2017) or at the household level (Koerth 
et al., 2014) support a better understanding of the anthropogenic 
drivers of exposure and vulnerability. Four examples of drivers that 
were only emerging at the time of the AR5 are discussed below. Very 
importantly, another major emerging dimension that is not discussed 
here but rather in Section  4.4.4, relates to  power asymmetries, 
politics, and the prevailing political economy, which are important 
drivers of exposure and vulnerability to SLR-related coastal hazards, 
and consequently adaptation prospects (Eriksen et al., 2015; Dolšak 
and Prakash, 2018). Recent literature provides examples in coastal 
megacities like Jakarta, Indonesia (Shatkin, 2019) as well as in 
smaller cities, like Maputo, Mozambique (Broto et al., 2015) and 
Surat, India (Chu, 2016a; Chu, 2016b), and many other coastal cities 
and settlements around the world (high conﬁdence; Jones et al., 
2015; Allen et al., 2018; Hughes et al., 2018; Sovacool, 2018).
4.3.2.4.1 Gender inequality 
Gender inequality came to prominence only recently in climate change 
studies (~15 years ago; see Pearse, 2017). In light of sea-related 
hazards and SLR speciﬁcally, the issue is still mainly investigated in the 
context of developing countries, although growing attention is paid to 
the issue in developed countries (e.g., Lee et al., 2015; Pearse, 2017). 
Recent studies in southern coastal Bangladesh, for example, show 
that women get less access than men to climate- and disaster-related 
information (both emergency information and training programmes), 
decision making processes at the household and community levels, 
economic resources including ﬁnancial means such as micro-credit, 
land ownership, and mobility within and outside the villages (Rahman, 
2013; Alam and Rahman, 2014; Garai, 2016). Gender inequity may 
be inherent in unfavourable background conditions (higher illiteracy 
rates, deﬁciencies in food and calories intake and poorer health 
conditions) as a result of, among other things, traditions, social norms 
and patriarchy. Together, these barriers disadvantage women more 
than men in developing effective responses to anticipate gradual 
environmental changes such as persistent coastal erosion, ﬂooding 
and soil salinisation (medium evidence, high agreement). Such 
conclusions are in line with the literature on gender inequality and 
climate change at large (Alston, 2013; Pearse, 2017), thus suggesting 
no major SLR-inherent speciﬁcities.
4.3.2.4.2 Loss of indigenous knowledge and local knowledge 
Despite the identiﬁcation of this issue in AR4, its treatment in 
AR5 remained limited. Recent literature partly focussing on SLR 
reafﬁrms that indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (IK and 
LK; Cross-Chapter Box  4 in Chapter  1 and Glossary) are key to 
determining how people recognise and respond to environmental 
risk (Bridges and McClatchey, 2009; Lefale, 2010; Leonard et al., 
2013; Lazrus, 2015), and therefore to increasing adaptive capacity 
and reducing long-term vulnerability (Ignatowski and Rosales, 2013; 
McMillen et al., 2014; Hesed and Paolisso, 2015; Janif et al., 2016; 
Morrison, 2017). 
IK and LK contribute both as a foundation for and an outcome of 
customary resource management systems aimed at regulating 
resource use and securing critical ecosystem protection (examples 
in Indonesia; Hiwasaki et al., 2015), structuring the relationship 
between people and authorities, and framing and maintaining a 
strong sense of place in the community (examples in Timor Leste; 
Hiwasaki et al., 2015). In turn, this allows local communities to 
predict and prepare for both sudden shock events that have historical 
precedent and, when IK and LK are embedded in day-to-day rituals 
and decision making processes, to also anticipate the consequences 
of gradual changes, as in sea level (examples in Indonesia; Hiwasaki 
et al., 2015). Customary resource management systems based on 
IK and elders’ leadership – for instance, Rahui in French Polynesia 
(Gharasian, 2016), or Mo in the Marshall Islands (Bridges and 
McClatchey, 2009) – also allow communities to diversify access to 
marine and terrestrial resources using seasonal calendars, to ensure 
collective food and water security, and to maintain ecological 
integrity (McMillen et al., 2014). In rural Paciﬁc atolls, traditional 
food preservation and storage (e.g.,  storing germinated coconuts 
or drying ﬁsh) still play a role in anticipating disruptions in natural 
resource availability (Campbell, 2015; Lazrus, 2015). Such practices 
have enabled the survival of isolated communities from the Arctic 
to tropical islands in constraining sea environments for centuries 
to millennia (McMillen et al., 2014; Nunn et al., 2017a). Morrison 
(2017) argues that IK and LK can also play a role in supporting 
internal migration in response to SLR, by avoiding social and cultural 
uprooting (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1).
In some speciﬁc contexts, climate change will also imply no-analogue 
changes, such as rapid ice-melt and changing conditions in the Arctic 
that have no precedent in the modern era, and could thus limit the 
relevance of IK and LK in efforts to address signiﬁcantly different 
circumstances. Except in these speciﬁc situations, the literature 
374
Chapter 4 
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities
4
suggests that the loss of IK and LK, and related social norms and 
mechanisms, will increase populations’ exposure and vulnerability to 
SLR impacts (Nakashima et al., 2012). The literature notably points 
out that modern, externally-driven socioeconomic dynamics, such as 
the introduction of imported food (noodles, rice, canned meat and 
ﬁsh, etc.), diminish the cultural importance of IK-based practices and 
diets locally, together with introducing dependency on monetisation 
and external markets (Hay, 2013; Campbell, 2015). 
As a result, the loss of IK and LK may increase long-term vulnerability 
to SLR (medium evidence, high agreement). Given that IK and LK are 
largely based on observing and ‘making sense’ of the surrounding 
environment (moon, waves, winds, animal behaviours, topography, 
etc.), such a loss reﬂects a more general concern about the weakening 
of environmental connectedness in contemporary societies, which is 
not limited to remote, rural and developing communities (medium 
conﬁdence). In developed contexts too, the loss of LK has played a 
critical role in recent coastal disasters (e.g., Katrina in 2005 in the 
USA, Kates et al., 2006) and increasing vulnerability to SLR (e.g., 
Newton and Weichselgartner, 2014; Wong et al., 2014). 
4.3.2.4.3 Social capital 
Coastal communities draw on social structures and capabilities 
that can reduce risk and increase adaptive capacity in the face of 
coastal hazards (Aldrich, 2017; Petzold, 2018). Although the term is 
subject to debate (Meyer, 2018), social capital – that is, the level 
of cohesion between individuals, between groups of individuals, and 
between people and institutions, within and between communities – 
is considered to be a key enabler for collective action to reduce risk 
and build adaptive capacity (Adger, 2010; Aldrich and Meyer, 2015; 
Petzold and Ratter, 2015). Levels of social capital can be inﬂuenced 
by underlying social processes, such as socioeconomic (in)equalities, 
gender issues, health, social networks and social media. It applies 
to both developing and developed countries, for example in densely 
populated deltas (Jordan, 2015), European coasts (Jones and Clark, 
2014; Petzold, 2016), Asian urban or semi-urban coastal areas (Lo 
et al., 2015; Triyanti et al., 2017) and Paciﬁc islands (Neef et al., 2018). 
Social capital framed as an enabler for reducing vulnerability has been 
studied in the context of extreme events (risk prevention mechanisms, 
emergency responses and post-crisis actions) and collective 
environmental management (e.g.,  replanting mangroves, beach 
cleaning, etc.). Social capital also enables adaptation prospects. For 
example, its role has been explored in public acceptability of long-term 
coastal adaptation policies in the UK (Jones and Clark, 2014; Jones 
et al., 2015). The role of social capital in building resilience to climate 
stress in coastal Bangladesh was explored by Jordan (2015), who 
found complex and even contradictory interactions between social 
capital and resilience to climate stress. Among others, Jordan (2015) 
also advises caution about uncritical importation of such Westernised 
concepts in seeking to understand and address coastal vulnerability 
in developing countries. 
4.3.2.4.4 Risk perception 
Risk perception, which is context-speciﬁc and varies from one 
individual to another, may inﬂuence communities’ exposure and 
vulnerability as it shapes authorities’ and people’s attitudes towards 
sudden and slow onset hazards, as shown by Terpstra (2011), 
Lazrus (2015), Elrick-Barr et al. (2017) and O’Neill et al. (2016) in 
the Netherlands, Tuvalu, Australia and Ireland, respectively. The 
progressive discounting of coastal hazard risks and subsequent 
loss of risk memory also played a role in coastal disasters such as 
Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in the USA (Burby, 2006; Kates et al., 2006) 
and Storm Xynthia in 2010 in France (Vinet et al., 2012; Genovese 
and Przyluski, 2013; Chadenas et al., 2014). 
Risk perceptions stem from intertwined predictors such as ‘gender, 
political party identiﬁcation, cause-knowledge,  impact-knowledge, 
response-knowledge, holistic affect, personal experience with 
extreme weather events, [social norms] and biospheric value 
orientations’ (Kellens et al., 2011; Carlton and Jacobson, 2013; Lujala 
et al., 2015; van der Linden, 2015, p. 112; Weber, 2016; Elrick-Barr 
et al., 2017; Goeldner-Gianella et al., 2019). In general, there is a 
lack of education, training and thus knowledge and literacy on recent 
and projected trends in sea level, which compromises ownership 
of science facts and projections at all levels, from individuals and 
institutions to society at large.
While some studies have begun to highlight the inﬂuence of the 
distance from the sea on risk perceptions (Milfont et al., 2014; Lujala 
et al., 2015; O’Neill et al., 2016), there is still little knowledge about 
how risk perceptions vary across different geographical and social 
contexts, and how this inﬂuences exposure and vulnerability to 
coastal hazards (e.g., Terpstra, 2011; van der Linden, 2015). There 
is a critical lack of studies speciﬁcally addressing SLR. Some recent 
works conducted in coastal Australia suggest that while people are 
conﬁdent about their ability to cope with an already experienced 
event, when it comes to SLR, the dominant narrative is articulated 
around the barriers related to the ‘uncertainty in the nature and 
scale of the impacts as well as the response options available’ 
(Elrick-Barr et al., 2017, p. 1147). Similar conclusions have been 
highlighted in the Caribbean islands of St. Vincent (Smith, 2018) and 
the Bahamas (Thomas and Benjamin, 2018). SLR is rarely addressed 
separately from sea-related extreme events, which masks a crucial 
difference between already-observed and delayed impacts. Climate 
change is considered a “distant psychological risk” (Spence et al., 
2012), making it and SLR per se ‘markedly different from the way 
that our ancestors have traditionally perceived threats in their local 
environment’ (Milfont et al., 2014; Lujala et al., 2015; van der Linden, 
2015, p. 112; O’Neill et al., 2016).
4.3.2.5 
Towards a Synthetic Understanding  
of the Drivers of Exposure and Vulnerability
Recent literature conﬁrms that anthropogenic drivers played an 
important role, over the last century, in increasing exposure and 
vulnerability worldwide, and indicates that they will continue 
to do so in the absence of adaptation (medium evidence, high 
agreement). Some scholars argue that ‘even with pervasive and 
extensive environmental change associated with ~2ºC warming, it 
is non-climatic factors that primarily determine impacts, response 
options and barriers to adapting’ (Ford et al., 2015, p. 1046). Although 
it is the interaction of climate and non-climate factors that eventually 
375
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4
4
determine the level of impacts, acknowledging the role of a range of 
purely anthropogenic drivers has important implications for action. It 
suggests that major action can be taken now to enhance long-term 
adaptation prospects, notwithstanding uncertainty about local RSL 
rise and resultant impacts in the distant future (medium evidence, 
high agreement; Magnan et al., 2016). Acting on the human-driven 
drivers and root causes of vulnerability could yield co-beneﬁts, for 
example by improving the state and condition of coastal ecosystems – 
and hence the capacity to cope with or adapt to SLR impacts – or, in 
deltaic regions, lowering the rates of anthropogenic subsidence and, 
in turn, minimising changes in sea level. 
In addition, coastal ecosystem degradation is acknowledged as 
another major non-climatic driver of exposure and vulnerability 
(high conﬁdence). The ability of coastal ecosystems to serve as a 
buffer zone between the sea and human assets (settlements and 
infrastructure), and to provide regulating services with respect to 
SLR-related coastal hazards (including inundation and salinisation), 
is progressively being lost due to coastal squeeze, pollution, and 
habitat and land degradation mainly due to land-use conversion. 
We now better understand the diversity and interactions of the 
climate and non-climate drivers of exposure and vulnerability, as well 
as their dynamics over time (Bennett et al., 2016; Duvat et al., 2017). 
As a result, it is now realised how many context-speciﬁcities interact 
(including geography, economic development, social inequity, power 
and politics, and risk perceptions) and play a critical role in shaping 
the direction and inﬂuence of individual drivers and of their possible 
combinations on the ground (medium evidence, high agreement; 
Eriksen et al., 2015; Hesed and Paolisso, 2015; McCubbin et al., 
2015). This also provides a stronger foundation to identify the range 
of possible responses (Sections 1.6.1, 1.6.2 and 4.4.3) to observed 
impacts and projected risks, as well as critical areas of action to 
enhance adaptation pathways (Section 4.4.4). 
Recent studies (e.g.,  cited in Sections 4.3.2.1.1, 4.3.2.2, 4.3.2.4.2 
and 4.3.2.4.4) also conﬁrm AR5 conclusions that both developing 
and developed countries are exposed and vulnerable to SLR 
(high conﬁdence).
4.3.3 
Observed Impacts, and Current  
and Future Risk of Sea Level Rise 
SLR leads to hazards and impacts that are also partly inherent in 
other processes such as starvation of sediments provided by rivers 
(Kondolf et al., 2014); permafrost thaw and ice retreat; or the 
disruption of natural dynamics by land reclamation or sediment 
mining. Six main concerns for low-lying coasts (Figure 4.13) are: (i) 
permanent submergence of land by mean sea levels or mean high 
tides; (ii) more frequent or intense ﬂooding; (iii) enhanced erosion; 
(iv) loss and change of ecosystems; (v) salinisation of soils, ground

and surface water; and (vi) impeded drainage. This section discusses 
some of these hazards (ﬂooding, erosion, salinisation) as well as 
observed and projected impacts on some critical marine ecosystems 
(marshes, mangroves, lagoons, coral reefs and seagrasses), 
ecosystem services (coastal protection) and human societies (people, 
assets, infrastructures, economic and subsistence activities, inequity 
and well-being, etc.). In many cases, the Chapter 4 assessment of 
impacts and responses uses results from literature based on values 
of SLR and ESL events prior to SROCC. However, the general ﬁndings 
reported here also carry forward with the new SROCC SLR and ESL 
values. Except in the case of submergence and ﬂooding of coastal 
areas (Section  4.3.3.2), this section assumes no major additional 
adaptation efforts compared to today (i.e.,  neither signiﬁcant 
intensiﬁcation of ongoing action nor new types of action), thus 
reﬂecting the state of knowledge in the literature.
4.3.3.1 
Attribution of Observed Physical Changes  
to Sea Level Rise 
The AR5 concludes that attribution of coastal changes to SLR is 
difﬁcult because ‘the coastal sea level change signal is often small 
when compared to other processes’ (Wong et al., 2014: 375). New 
literature, however, shows that extreme water levels at the coast 
are rising due to mean SLR (4.2.2.4 for observations, and 4.3.5 for 
projections), with observable impacts on chronic ﬂooding in some 
regions (Sweet and Park, 2014; Strauss et al., 2016).
On coastal morphological changes for example, contemporary SLR 
currently acts as a ‘background driver’, with extreme events, changes 
in wave patterns, tides and human intervention often described as 
the prevailing drivers of observed changes (Grady et al., 2013; Albert 
et al., 2016). Morphological changes are also interacting with other 
impacts of SLR, such as coastal ﬂooding (Pollard et al., 2018). Despite 
the complexity of the attribution issue (Romine et al., 2013; Le 
Cozannet et al., 2014), recent literature suggests possibly emerging 
signs of the direct inﬂuence of recent SLR on shoreline behaviour, 
for example on small highly-sensitive reef islands in New Caledonia 
(Garcin et al., 2016) and in the Solomon Islands (Albert et al., 2016). 
Early signs of the direct inﬂuence of SLR on estuaries’ water salinity 
are also emerging, for example, in the Delaware, USA, where Ross 
et al. (2015) estimate a rate of salinity increase by as much as 4.4 psu 
(Practical Salinity Unit) per metre of SLR since the 1950s.
Overall, while the literature suggests that it is still too early to attribute 
coastal impacts to SLR in most of the world’s coastal areas, there 
is very high conﬁdence that as sea level continues to rise (Sections 
4.2.3.2, 4.2.3.3), the frequency, severity and duration of hazards and 
related impacts increases (Woodruff et al., 2013; Lilai et al., 2016; 
Vitousek et al., 2017; Sections 4.2.3.4, 6.3.1.3). Detectable impacts 
and attributable impacts on shoreline behaviour are expected as 
soon as the second half of the 21st century (Nicholls and Cazenave, 
2010; Storlazzi et al., 2018).
4.3.3.2 
Submergence and Flooding of Coastal Areas 
Since AR5, a number of continental and global scale coastal exposure 
studies have accounted for sub-national human dynamics such as 
coastward migration or coastal urbanisation. These studies project 
a population increase in the LECZ (coastal areas below 10  m of 
elevation) by 2100 of 85 to 239 million people as compared to only 
considering national dynamics (Merkens et al., 2016; Section 4.3.2). 
Under the ﬁve SSPs and without SLR, the population living in the 
LECZ increases from 640–700 million in 2000 to over one billion in 
2050 under all SSPs, and then declines to 500–900 million in 2100 
under all SSPs, except for SSP3 (i.e., a world in which countries will 
increasingly focus on domestic issues, or at best regional ones), for 
which the coastal population reaches 1.1–1.2  billion (Jones and 
O’Neill, 2016; Merkens et al., 2016). 
The population exposed to mean and ESL events will grow 
signiﬁcantly during the 21st century (high conﬁdence) with 
socioeconomic development and SLR contributing roughly equally 
(medium conﬁdence). Considering an average relative SLR of 
0.7–0.9 m but no population growth, the number of people living 
below the hundred-year ESL in Latin America and the Caribbean 
will increase from 7.5 million in 2011 to 9 million by the end of the 
century (Reguero et al., 2015). Considering population growth and 
urbanisation, only 21 cm of global mean SLR by 2060 would increase 
the global population living below the hundred-year ESL from about 
189 million in 2000 to 316–411 million in 2060, with the largest 
absolute changes in South and Southeast Asia and the largest relative 
changes in Africa (Neumann et al., 2015). Considering population 
growth, Hauer et al. (2016) estimate that 4.3 and 13.1 million people 
in the USA would live below the levels of 0.9 and 1.8 m SLR by 2100.
New coastal ﬂood risk studies conducted since AR4 at global, 
continental and city scale, reinforce AR5 ﬁndings that if coastal 
societies do not adapt, ﬂood risks will increase by 2–3 orders of 
magnitude reaching catastrophic levels by the end of the century, 
even under the lower end SLR expected under RCP2.6 (high 
conﬁdence; Hinkel et al., 2014; Abadie et al., 2016; Diaz, 2016; 
Hunter et al., 2017; Lincke and Hinkel, 2018; Abadie, 2018; Brown 
et al., 2018a; Nicholls, 2018). In combination, these studies take 
into account a SLR scenario range wider than the likely range of 
AR5 but consistent with the range of projections assessed in this 
report (Section 4.2.3.2). For example, considering 25–123 cm of SLR 
in 2100, all SSPs and no adaptation, Hinkel et al. (2014) ﬁnd that 
0.2–4.6% of global population is expected to be ﬂooded annually in 
2100, with expected annual damages (EAD) amounting to 0.3–9.3% 
of global GDP. Assessing 120 cities globally, Abadie (2018) ﬁnd that 
under a weighted combination of the probabilistic scenarios, New 
Orleans and Guangzhou Guangdong rank highest with EAD above 
1 trillion USD (not discounted) in each city. For Europe, EAD are 
expected to rise from 1.25 billion EUR today to 93–960 billion EUR 
by the end of the century (Vousdoukas et al., 2018b). Already today, 
many small islands face large ﬂood damages relative to their GDP 
speciﬁcally through TCs (Cashman and Nagdee, 2017) and under SLR 
EAD can reach up to several percent of GDP in 2100, as highlighted in 
377

Chapter 4

AR5 (Wong et al., 2014). Similar to the exposure studies, estimates of 
future ﬂood risk without considering adaptation, as presented in this 
paragraph, do not provide a meaningful characterisation of coastal 
ﬂood risks, because adaptation and speciﬁcally hard protection 
is expected to be widespread during the 21st century in urban 
areas and cities (high conﬁdence; Section 4.4.3.2.2). Rather, these 
estimates need to be seen as illustrations of the scale of adaptation 
needed to offset risk.
Flood risk studies that have included adaptation ﬁnd that hard coastal 
protection is generally very effective in reducing ﬂood risks during 
the 21st century even under high SLR scenarios (high conﬁdence; 
Hinkel et al., 2014; Diaz, 2016; Brown et al., 2018a; Hinkel et al., 2018; 
Lincke and Hinkel, 2018; Tamura et al., 2019) (Section  4.4.2.2.2). 
For example, Hinkel et al. (2014) ﬁnd that under 25–123 cm of SLR 
in 2100 and all SSPs, hard coastal protection reduces the annual 
number of people affected by coastal ﬂoods and EAD by 2–3 orders 
of magnitude. Under high-end SLR and beyond the 21st century, 
effectiveness of coastal adaptation is expected to decline rapidly, but 
there is a lack of studies addressing this issue. Furthermore, there is a 
lack of studies taking into account responses beyond hard protection 
such as ecosystem-based adaptation, accommodation, advance and 
retreat (Sections 4.4.2). 
Studies also conﬁrm AR5 ﬁndings that the relative costs and beneﬁts 
of coastal adaptation are distributed unequally across countries and 
regions (high conﬁdence; Wong et al., 2014; Diaz, 2016; Lincke and 
Hinkel, 2018; Tamura et al., 2019). For example, while the median cost 
of protection and retreat under RCP8.5 in 2050 has been estimated 
to be under 0.09% of national GDP, large relative costs are found for 
small island states such as the Marshall Islands (7.6%), the Maldives 
(7.5%), Tuvalu (4.6%) and Kiribati (4.1%; Diaz, 2016). Furthermore, 
on a global average and for urban and densely populated regions, 
hard protection is highly cost efﬁcient with beneﬁt-cost ratios up 
to 104, but for poorer and less densely populated areas beneﬁt-cost 
ratios are generally smaller than one (Lincke and Hinkel, 2018). Hence, 
without substantial transfer payments supporting poor areas, coastal 
ﬂood risks will evolve unequally during this century, with richer and 
densely populated areas well protected behind hard structures and 
poorer less densely populated areas suffering losses and damages, 
and eventually retreating from the coast.
While continental to global scale ﬂood exposure and risk studies 
have also explored a wider range of uncertainty as compared to 
AR5, much remains to be done. All of these studies rely on global 
elevation data, but few studies have explored the underlying bias. 
For example, for the Po delta in Italy, it was found that elevation 
data based on the widely used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission 
(SRTM), Reuter et al. (2007) overestimates the 100-year ﬂoodplain by 
about 50% as compared to local Lidar data (Wolff et al., 2016), while 
in the Ria Formosa region in Portugal SRTM underestimates EAD by 
up to 50% depending on the resampled resolution of the Lidar data 
(Vousdoukas et al., 2018a). For the USA, SRTM data systemically 
underestimates population exposure below 3 m by more than 60% 
as compared to coastal Lidar data (Kulp and Strauss, 2016). A global 
scale comparison of major contributors to ﬂood risk uncertainty 
ﬁnds that uncertainty in digital elevation data is roughly at equal 
footing with uncertainties in socioeconomic development, emission 
scenarios, and SLR in determining the magnitude of ﬂood risks in the 
21st century (Hinkel et al., 2014). At a European level, the number of 
people living in the 100-year coastal ﬂoodplain can vary between 
20–70% depending on the different inundation models used and the 
inclusion or exclusion of wave set up (Vousdoukas, 2016). Comparing 
damage functions attained in different studies for European cities, 
Prahl et al. (2018) ﬁnd up to four-fold differences in damages for 
ﬂoods above 3 m. Another major source of uncertainty relates to 
uncertainties in present-day ESL events due to the application of 
different extreme value methods (Wahl et al., 2017; Section 4.2.3.4). 
While all of the uncertainties reported above affected the actual 
size of exposure and ﬂood risk ﬁgures, they do not affect the overall 
conclusions drawn here. 
4.3.3.3 
Coastal Erosion and Projected Global Impacts 
of Enhanced Erosion on Human Systems 
Recent global assessments of coastal erosion indicate that land losses 
currently dominate over land gains and that human interventions are 
a major driver of shoreline changes (Cazenave and Cozannet, 2014; 
Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018). Luijendijk et al. (2018) 
estimate that over the 1984–2016 period, about a quarter of the 
world’s sandy beaches eroded at rates exceeding 0.5 m yr–1 while 
about 28% accreted. While such global results can be challenged 
due to the relatively large detection threshold used (±0.5 m yr–1), 
there is growing literature indicating that coastal erosion is occurring 
or increasing, e.g. in the Arctic (Barnhart et al., 2014a; Farquharson 
et al., 2018; Irrgang et al., 2019), Brazil (Amaro et al., 2015), China 
(Yang et al., 2017), Colombia (Rangel-Buitrago et al., 2015), India 
(Kankara et al., 2018), and along a large number of deltaic systems 
worldwide (e.g., Section 4.2.2.4).
Since AR5, however, there is growing appreciation and understanding 
of the ability of coastal systems to respond dynamically to SLR (Passeri 
et al., 2015; Lentz et al., 2016; Deng et al., 2017). Most low-lying coastal 
systems exhibit important feedbacks between biological and physical 
processes (e.g., Wright and Nichols, 2018), that have allowed them 
to maintain a relatively stable morphology under moderate rates of 
SLR (<0.3 cm yr–1) over the past few millennia (Woodruff et al., 2013; 
Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1). In a global review on multi-decadal 
changes in the land area of 709 atoll islands, Duvat (2019) shows that 
in a context of more rapid SLR than the global mean (Becker et al., 
2012; Palanisamy et al., 2014), 73.1% of islands were stable in area, 
while respectively 15.5% and 11.4% increased and decreased in size. 
While anthropogenic drivers played a major role, especially in urban 
islands (e.g., shoreline stabilisation by coastal defences, increase in 
island size as a result of reclamation works), this study and others 
(e.g., McLean and Kench, 2015) suggest that these islands have had 
the capacity to maintain their land area by naturally adjusting to SLR 
over the past decades (high conﬁdence). However, it has been argued 
that this capacity could be reduced in the coming decades, due to the 
combination of higher rates of SLR, increased wave energy (Albert et al., 
2016), changes in run-up (Shope et al., 2017) and storm wave direction 
(Harley et al., 2017), effects of ocean warming and acidiﬁcation on 
critical ecosystems such as coral reefs (Section  4.3.3.5.2), and a 
continued increase in anthropogenic pressure.

From a global scale perspective, based on AR4 SLR scenarios and 
without considering the potential beneﬁts of adaptation, Hinkel et al. 
(2013b) estimate that about 6000 to 17,000 km2 of land is expected 
to be lost during the 21st century due to enhanced coastal erosion 
associated with SLR, in combination with other drivers. This could 
lead to a displacement of 1.6–5.3  million people and associated 
cumulative costs of 300 to 1000  billion USD (Section  4.4.3.5). 
Importantly, these global ﬁgures mask the wide diversity of local 
situations; and some literature is emerging on the non-physical and 
non-quantiﬁable impacts of coastal erosion, for example, on the loss 
of recreational grounds and the induced risks to the associated social 
dimensions (i.e., how local communities experience coastal erosion 
impacts; Karlsson et al., 2015).
4.3.3.4 
Salinisation 
With rising sea levels, saline water intrusion into coastal aquifers 
and surface waters and soils is expected to be more frequent and 
enter farther landwards. Salinisation of groundwater, surface water 
and soil resources also increases with land-based drought events, 
decreasing river discharges in combination with water extraction and 
SLR (high conﬁdence).
4.3.3.4.1 Coastal aquifers and groundwater lenses 
Groundwater volumes will primarily be affected by variations in 
precipitation patterns (Taylor et al., 2013; Jiménez Cisneros et al., 
2014), which are expected to increase water stress in small islands 
(Holding et al., 2016). While SLR will mostly impact groundwater 
quality (Bailey et al., 2016) and in turn exacerbate salinisation 
induced by marine ﬂooding events (Gingerich et al., 2017), it will 
also affect the watertable height (Rotzoll and Fletcher, 2013; Jiménez 
Cisneros et al., 2014; Masterson et al., 2014; Werner et al., 2017). 
In addition, the natural migration of groundwater lenses inland in 
response to SLR can also be severely constrained by urbanisation, 
for example, in semi-arid South Texas, USA (Uddameri et al., 2014).
These changes will affect both freshwater availability (for drinking 
water supply and agriculture) and vegetation dynamics. At many 
locations, however, direct anthropogenic inﬂuences, such as 
groundwater pumping for agricultural or urban uses, already impact 
salinisation of coastal aquifers more strongly than what is expected 
from SLR in the 21st century (Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Jiménez 
Cisneros et al., 2014; Uddameri et al., 2014), with trade-offs in terms 
of groundwater depletion that may contribute to anthropogenic 
subsidence and thus increase coastal ﬂood risk. Recent studies also 
suggest that the inﬂuence of land-surface inundation on seawater 
intrusion and resulting salinisation of groundwater lenses on 
small islands has been underestimated until now (Ataie-Ashtiani 
et al., 2013; Ketabchi et al., 2014). Such impacts will potentially also 
combine with a projected drying of most of the tropical-to-temperate 
islands by mid-century (Karnauskas et al., 2016).
4.3.3.4.2 Surface waters 
The quality of surface water resources (in estuaries, rivers, reservoirs, 
etc.) can be affected by the intrusion of saline water, both in a 
direct (increased salinity) and indirect way (altered environmental 
conditions which change the behaviour of pollutants and microbes). 
In terms of direct impacts, statistical models and long-term (1950 to 
present) records of salinity show signiﬁcant upward trends in salinity 
and a positive correlation between rising sea levels and increasing 
residual salinity, for example in the Delaware Estuary, USA (Ross 
et al., 2015). Higher salinity levels, further inland, have also been 
reported in the Gorai river basin, southwestern Bangladesh (Bhuiyan 
and Dutta, 2012), and in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. In the Mekong 
Delta for instance, salinity intrusion extends around 15 km inland 
during the rainy season and typically around 50 km during dry season 
(Gugliotta et al., 2017). Importantly, salinity intrusion in these deltas 
is caused by a variety of factors such as changes in discharge and 
water abstraction along with relative SLR. More broadly, the impact 
of salinity intrusion can be signiﬁcant in river deltas or low-lying 
wetlands, especially during low-ﬂow periods such as in the dry season 
(Dessu et al., 2018). In Bangladesh, for instance, some freshwater ﬁsh 
species are expected to lose their habitat with increasing salinity, with 
profound consequences on ﬁsh-dependent communities (Dasgupta 
et al., 2017). In the Florida Coastal Everglades, sea level increasingly 
exceeds ground surface elevation at the most downstream freshwater 
sites, affecting marine-to-freshwater hydrologic connectivity and 
transport of salinity and phosphorous upstream from the Gulf of 
Mexico. The impact of SLR is higher in the dry season when there 
is practically no freshwater inﬂow (Dessu et al., 2018). Salinity 
intrusion was shown to cause shifts in the diatom assemblages, 
with expected cascading effects through the food web (Mazzei and 
Gaiser, 2018). Salinisation of surface water may lead to limitations 
in drinking water supply (Wilbers et al., 2014), as well as to future 
fresh water shortage in reservoirs, for example in Shanghai (Li et al., 
2015). Salinity changes the partitioning and mobility of some metals, 
and hence their concentration or speciation in the water bodies 
(Noh et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2015; de Souza Machado et al., 2018). 
Varying levels of salinity also inﬂuence the abundance and toxicity of 
Vibrio cholerae in the Ganges Delta (Batabyal et al., 2016).
4.3.3.4.3 Soils 
Salinisation is one of the major drivers of soil degradation, with sea 
water intrusion being one of the common causes (Daliakopoulos 
et al., 2016). In a study in the Ebro Delta, Spain, for instance, soil 
salinity was shown to be directly related to distances to the river, to 
the delta inner border, and to the old river mouth (Genua-Olmedo 
et al., 2016). Land elevation was the most important variable in 
explaining soil salinity. 
SLR was also shown to decrease organic carbon (Corg) concentrations 
and stocks in sediments of salt marshes as reworked marine particles 
contribute with a lower amount of Corg than terrigenous sediments. Corg 
accumulation in tropical salt marshes can be as high as in mangroves 
and the reduction of Corg stocks by ongoing SLR might cause high CO2 
releases (Ruiz-Fernández et al., 2018). In many cases attribution to SLR 
is missing, but, independent from clear attribution, sea water intrusion 
leads to a salinisation of exposed soils with changes in carbon 
dynamics (Ruiz-Fernández et al., 2018) and microbial communities 
(Sánchez-Rodríguez et al., 2017), soil enzyme activity and metal toxicity 
(Zheng et al., 2017). Water salinity levels in the pores of coastal marsh

soils can become signiﬁcantly elevated in just one week of ﬂooding by 
sea water, which can potentially negatively impact associated microbial 
communities for signiﬁcantly longer time periods (McKee et al., 2016). 
SLR will also alter the frequency and magnitude of wet/dry periods 
and salinity levels in coastal ecosystems, with consequences for the 
formation of climate relevant GHGs (Liu et al., 2017b) and therefore 
feedbacks to the climate.
Soil salinisation affects agriculture directly with impacts on plant 
germination (Sánchez-García et al., 2017), plant biomass (rice and 
cotton) production (Yao et al., 2015), and yield (Genua-Olmedo 
et al., 2016). Impact on agriculture is especially relevant in low-lying 
coastal areas where agricultural production is a major land use, such 
as in river deltas. 
4.3.3.5 
Ecosystems and Ecosystem Services
4.3.3.5.1 Tidal wetlands 
Global coastal wetlands have been reduced by a half since the 
pre-industrial period due to the impacts of both climatic and 
non-climatic drivers such as ﬂooding, coastal urbanisation, 
alterations in drainage and sediment supply. (Sections 4.3.2.3, 5.3.2). 
Potentially one of the most important of the eco-morphodynamic 
feedbacks allowing for relatively stable morphology under SLR is the 
ability of marsh and mangrove systems to enhance the trapping of 
sediment, which in turn allows tidal wetlands to grow and increase 
the production and accumulation of organic material (Kirwan and 
Megonigal, 2013). When ecosystem health is maintained and 
sufﬁcient sediment exists to support their growth, this particular 
feedback has generally allowed marshes and mangrove systems to 
build vertically at rates equal to or greater than SLR up to the present 
day (Kirwan et al., 2016; Woodroffe et al., 2016). 
While recent reviews suggest that mangroves’ surface accretion 
rate will keep pace with a high SLR scenario (RCP8.5) up to years 
2055 and 2070 in fringe and basin mangrove settings, respectively 
(Sasmito et al., 2016), process-based models of vertical marsh 
growth that incorporate biological and physical feedbacks support 
survival under rates of SLR as high as 1–5 cm yr–1 before drowning 
(Kirwan et al., 2016). Threshold rates of SLR before marsh drowning 
however vary signiﬁcantly from site-to-site and can be substantially 
lower than 1 cm yr–1 in micro-tidal regions where the tidal trapping 
of sediment is reduced and/or in areas with low sediment availability 
(Lovelock et al., 2015; Ganju et al., 2017; Jankowski et al., 2017; 
Watson et al., 2017). Global environmental change may also to lead 
to changes in growth rates, productivity and geographic distribution 
of different mangrove and marsh species, including the replacement 
of environmentally sensitive species by those possessing greater 
climatic tolerance (Krauss et al., 2014; Reef and Lovelock, 2014; 
Coldren et al., 2019). Processes impacting lateral changes at the 
marsh boundary including wave erosion are just as important, if not 
more, than vertical accretion rates in determining coastal wetland 
survival (e.g., Mariotti and Carr, 2014). For most low-lying coastlines, 
a seaward loss of wetland area due to marsh retreat could be offset 
by a similar landward migration of coastal wetlands (Kirwan and 
Megonigal, 2013; Schile et al., 2014), this landward migration having 
the potential to maintain and even increase the extent of coastal 
wetlands globally (Morris et al., 2012; Kirwan et al., 2016; Schuerch 
et al., 2018). This natural process will however be constrained in areas 
with steep topography or hard engineering structures (i.e., coastal 
squeeze, Section 4.3.2.4). Seawalls, levees and dams can also prevent 
the ﬂuvial and marine transport of sediment to wetland areas and 
reduce their resilience further (Giosan, 2014; Tessler et al., 2015; Day 
et al., 2016; Spencer et al., 2016).
4.3.3.5.2 Coral reefs 
Coral reefs are considered to be the marine ecosystem most 
threatened by climate-related ocean change, especially ocean 
warming and acidiﬁcation, even under an RCP2.6 scenario (Gattuso 
et al., 2015; Albright et al., 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Díaz 
et al., 2019; Section 5.3.4). AR5 concluded that ‘a number of coral 
reefs could [...] keep up with the maximum rate of SLR of 15.1 mm 
yr–1 projected for the end of the century […] (medium conﬁdence) 
[but a future net accretion rate lower] than during the Holocene 
(Perry et al., 2013) and increased turbidity (Storlazzi et al., 2011) 
will weaken this capability (very high conﬁdence)’ (Wong et al., 
2014: 379). Subsequently, some studies suggested that SLR may 
have negligible impacts on coral reefs’ vertical growth because the 
projected rate and magnitude of SLR by 2100 are within the potential 
accretion rates of most coral reefs (van Woesik et al., 2015). Other 
studies, however, stressed that the overall net vertical accretion of 
reefs may decrease after the ﬁrst 30 years of rise in a 1.2 m SLR 
scenario (Hamylton et al., 2014), and that most reefs will not be able 
to keep up with SLR under RCP4.5 and beyond (Perry et al., 2018). The 
SR1.5 also concludes that coral reefs ‘are projected to decline by a 
further 70–90% at 1.5ºC (high conﬁdence) with larger losses (>99%) 
at 2ºC (very high conﬁdence)’ (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018: 10). A key 
point is that SLR will not act in isolation of other drivers. Cumulative 
impacts, including anthropogenic drivers, are estimated to reduce the 
ability of coral reefs to keep pace with future SLR (Hughes et al., 
2017; Yates et al., 2017) and thereby reduce the capacity of reefs to 
provide sediments and protection to coastal areas. For example, the 
combination of reef erosion due to acidiﬁcation and human-induced 
mechanical destruction is altering seaﬂoor topography, increasing 
risks from SLR in carbonate sediment dominated regions (Yates et al., 
2017). Both ocean acidiﬁcation (Albright et al., 2018; Eyre et al., 2018) 
and ocean warming (Perry and Morgan, 2017) have been considered 
to slow future growth rates and reef accretion (Section 5.3.4). Recent 
literature also shows that alterations of coral reef 3D structure from 
changes in growth, breakage, disease or acidiﬁcation can profoundly 
affect their ability to buffer waves impacts (through wave breaking 
and wave energy damping), and therefore keep-up with SLR (Yates 
et al., 2017; Harris et al., 2018). Such prospects contribute to raise 
concerns about the future ability of atoll islands to adjust naturally 
to SLR and persist (Section 4.3.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9). Another 
concern is that locally, even minimal SLR can increase turbidity on 
fringing reefs, reducing light and, therefore, photosynthesis and 
calciﬁcation. SLR-induced turbidity can be caused by increased 
coastal erosion and the transfer of sediment to nearby reefs and 
enhanced sediment resuspension (Field et al., 2011).

4.3.3.5.3 Seagrasses 
Due to their natural capacity to enhance accretion and in the 
absence of mechanical or chemical destruction by human activities, 
seagrasses are not expected to be severely affected by SLR, except 
indirectly through the increase of the impacts of extreme weather 
events and waves on coastal morphology (i.e., erosion) as well as 
through changes in light levels and through effects on adjacent 
ecosystems (Saunders et al., 2013). Extreme ﬂooding events have 
also been shown to cause large-scale losses of seagrass habitats 
(Bandeira and Gell, 2003), for example seagrasses in Queensland, 
Australia, were lost in a disastrous ﬂooding event (Campbell and 
McKenzie, 2004). Changes in ocean currents can have either positive 
or negative effects on seagrasses, creating new space for seagrasses 
to grow or eroding seagrass beds (Bjork et al., 2008). But overall, 
seagrass will primarily be negatively affected by the direct effects 
of increased sea temperature on growth rates and the occurrence 
of disease (Marba and Duarte, 2010; Burge et al., 2013; Koch et al., 
2013; Thompson et al., 2015; Chefaoui et al., 2018; Gattuso et al., 
2018; Section 5.3.2) as well as by heavy rains that may dilute the 
seawater to a lower salinity. Such impacts will be exacerbated by 
major causes of seagrass decline including coastal eutrophication, 
siltation and coastal development (Waycott et al., 2009). Noteworthy 
is that some positive impacts are expected, as ocean acidiﬁcation 
is expected to beneﬁt photosynthesis and growth rates of seagrass 
(Repolho et al., 2017).
4.3.3.5.4 Coastal protection by coastal and marine ecosystems
Major ‘protection’ beneﬁts derived from the above-mentioned coastal 
ecosystems include wave attenuation and shoreline stabilisation, 
for example, by coral reefs (Elliff and Silva, 2017; Siegle and Costa, 
2017), mangroves (Zhang et al., 2012; Barbier, 2016; Menéndez et al., 
2018) or salt marshes (Möller et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015). Recently, 
a global meta-analysis of 69 studies demonstrated that, on average, 
these ecosystems together reduced wave heights between 35–71% 
at the limited locations considered (Narayan et al., 2016), with coral 
reefs, salt marshes, mangroves and seagrass/kelp beds reducing wave 
heights by 54–81%, 62–79%, 25–37% and 25–45% respectively 
(see Narayan et al., 2016 for map of locations considered). Additional 
studies suggest greater wave attenuation in mangrove systems 
(Horstman et al., 2014), and highlight broader complexities in wave 
attenuation related to total tidal wetland extent, water depth, and 
species. Global analyses show that natural and artiﬁcial seagrasses 
can attenuate wave height and energy by as much as 40% and 50%, 
respectively (Fonseca and Cahalan, 1992; John et al., 2015), while 
coral reefs have been observed to reduce total wave energy by 94–
98% (n = 13; Ferrario et al., 2014) and wave driven ﬂooding volume 
by 72% (Beetham et al., 2017). In addition, storm surge attenuation 
based on a recent literature review by Stark et al. (2015) range from 
-2–25 cm km–1 length of marsh, where the negative value denotes 
actual ampliﬁcation. Other ecosystems provide coastal protection, 
including macroalgae, oyster and mussel beds, and also beaches, 
dunes and barrier islands, but there is less understanding of the 
level of protection conferred by these other organisms and habitats 
(Spalding et al., 2014).
While there is little literature on the extent to which SLR speciﬁcally 
will affect coastal protection by coastal and marine ecosystems, it 
is estimated that SLR may reduce this ecosystem service (limited 
evidence, high agreement) through the above-described impacts on 
the ecosystems themselves, and in combination with the impacts of 
other climate-related changes to the ocean (e.g.,  ocean warming 
and acidiﬁcation; Sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.6, 5.4.1). Wave attenuation 
by coral reefs, for example, is estimated to be negatively affected 
in the near future by changes in coral reefs’ structural complexity 
more than by SLR (Harris et al., 2018); changes in mean and ESL 
events will rather add a layer of stress. Beck et al. (2018) estimate 
that under RCP8.5 by 2100, a 1 m loss in coral reefs’ height will 
increase the global area ﬂooded under a 100-year storm event by 
116% compared to today, against +66% with no reef loss.
4.3.3.6 
Human Activities
4.3.3.6.1 Coastal agriculture 
SLR will affect agriculture mainly through land submergence, soil 
and fresh groundwater resources salinisation, and land loss due 
to permanent coastal erosion, with consequences on production, 
livelihood diversiﬁcation and food security, especially in heavily 
coastal agriculture-dependent countries such as Bangladesh 
(Khanom, 2016). Recent literature conﬁrms that salinisation is 
already a major problem for traditional agriculture in deltas (Wong 
et al., 2014; Khai et al., 2018) and low-lying island nations where 
some edible cultivated plants such as taro patches are threatened 
(Nunn et al., 2017b). Taking the case of rice cultivation, recent works 
emphasise the prevailing role of combined surface elevation and soil 
salinity, such as in the Mekong delta (Vietnam; Smajgl et al., 2015) 
and in the Ebro delta (Spain; Genua-Olmedo et al., 2016), estimating 
for the latter a decrease in the rice production index from 61.2% in 
2010 to 33.8% by 2100 in a 1.8 m SLR scenario. For seven wetland 
species occurring in coastal freshwater marshes in central Veracruz 
on the Gulf of Mexico, an increase in salinity was shown to affect the 
germination process under wetland salt intrusion (Sánchez-García 
et al., 2017). In coastal Bangladesh, oilseed, sugarcane and 
jute cultivation was reported to be already discontinued due to 
challenges to cope with current salinity levels (Khanom, 2016), and 
salinity is projected to have an unambiguously negative inﬂuence 
on all dry-season crops over the next 15–45 years (especially in the 
southwest; Clarke et al., 2018; Kabir et al., 2018). Salinity intrusion 
and salinisation can trigger land use changes towards brackish or 
saline aquaculture such as shrimp or rice-shrimp systems with 
impacts on environment, livelihoods and income stability (Renaud 
et al., 2015). However, increasing salinity is only one of the land use 
change drivers along with, for example, policy changes and market 
prices at the household level (Renaud et al., 2015).
4.3.3.6.2 Coastal tourism and recreation
SLR may signiﬁcantly affect tourism and recreation through impacts 
on landscapes (e.g., beaches), cultural features (e.g., Marzeion and 
Levermann, 2014; Fang et al., 2016), and critical transportation 
infrastructures such as harbours and airports (Monioudi et al., 2018). 
Coastal areas’ future tourism and recreation attractiveness will 
381
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4
4
however also depend on changes in air temperature, seasonality and 
sea surface temperature (including induced effects such as invasive 
species, e.g., jellyﬁshes, and disease spreading; Burge et al., 2014; 
Weatherdon et al., 2016; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Section 5.4.2). 
Future changes in climatic conditions in tourists’ areas of origin will 
also play a role in reshaping tourism ﬂows (Bujosa and Rosselló, 
2013; Amelung and Nicholls, 2014), in addition to mitigation policies 
on air transportation, non-climatic features (e.g., accommodation 
and travel prices) and tourists’ and tourism developers’ perceptions 
of climate-related changes (Shakeela and Becken, 2015). Since AR5, 
forecasting the consequences of climate change effects on global-to-
local tourism ﬂows has remained challenging (Rosselló-Nadal, 2014; 
Wong et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). There are also 
concerns about the effect of SLR on tourism facilities, for example 
hotels in Ghana (Sagoe-Addy and Addo, 2013), in a context where 
tourism infrastructure often contributes to the degradation of 
natural buffering environments through, for example, coastal 
squeeze (e.g., Section  4.3.2.4) and human-driven coastal erosion. 
Again, forecasting is constrained by the lack of scientiﬁc studies on 
tourism stakeholders’ long-term strategies and adaptive capacity 
(Hoogendoorn and Fitchett, 2018).
4.3.3.6.3 Coastal ﬁsheries and aquaculture 
Recent studies support the AR5 conclusion that ocean warming and 
acidiﬁcation are considered more inﬂuential drivers of change in 
ﬁsheries and aquaculture than SLR (Larsen et al., 2014; Nurse et al., 
2014; Wong et al., 2014). The negative effects of SLR on ﬁsheries 
and aquaculture are indirect, through adverse impacts on habitats 
(e.g.,  coral reef degradation, reduced water quality in deltas and 
estuarine environments, soil salinisation, etc.), as well as on facilities 
(e.g., damage to small and large harbours). This makes future 
projections on SLR implications for coastal and marine ﬁsheries and 
aquaculture an understudied ﬁeld of research. Conclusions only 
state that future impacts will be highly context-speciﬁc due to local 
manifestations of SLR and local ﬁshery-dependent communities’ 
ability to adapt to alterations in ﬁsh and aquaculture conditions and 
productivity (Hollowed et al., 2013; Weatherdon et al., 2016). Salinity 
intrusion also contributes to conversion of land or freshwater ponds 
to brackish or saline aquaculture in many low-lying coastal areas 
of Southeast Asia such as in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam (Renaud 
et al., 2015).
4.3.3.6.4 Social values
Social values refer to what people consider of critical importance 
about the places in which they live, and range from material to 
immaterial things (assets, beliefs, etc.; Hurlimann et al., 2014; Rouse 
et al., 2017). Consideration of social values offers an opportunity 
to address a wider perspective on impacts on human systems, for 
example, complementary to quantitative assessments of health 
impacts (e.g., loss of source of calories and food insecurity; Keim, 
2010). This also encompasses immaterial dimensions, such as 
threats to cultural heritage (Marzeion and Levermann, 2014; Fatorić 
and Seekamp, 2017a), socialising activities (Karlsson et al., 2015), 
integration of marginalised groups (Maldonado, 2015) and cultural 
ecosystem services (Fish et al., 2016), and provides an opportunity to 
better reﬂect context-speciﬁcities in valuing the physical/ecological/
human/cultural impacts’ importance for and distribution within a 
given society (Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017b). This ﬁeld of research 
(no detailed mention found in AR5) is just emerging due to the 
transdisciplinary and qualitative nature of the topic. Graham et al. 
(2013) advance a 5-category framing of social values speciﬁcally at 
risk from SLR: health (i.e., the social determinants of survival such as 
environmental and housing quality and healthy lifestyles), feeling of 
safety (e.g., ﬁnancial and job security), belongingness (i.e., attachment 
to places and people), self-esteem (e.g., social status or pride that can 
be affected by coastal retreat), and self-actualisation (i.e., people’s 
efforts to deﬁne their own identity). Another emerging issue relates 
to social values at risk due to land submergence in low-lying islands 
(Yamamoto and Esteban, 2014) and parts of countries and individual 
properties (Marino, 2012; Maldonado et al., 2013; Aerts, 2017; 
Allgood and McNamara, 2017). Recent studies also highlight the 
potential additional risks to social values in areas where displaced 
people relocate (Davis et al., 2018).
4.3.4 
Conclusion on Coastal Risk: Reasons for Concern 
and Future Risks 
SLR projections for the 21st century, together with other ocean 
related changes (e.g., acidiﬁcation and warming) and the possible 
increase in human-driven pressures at the coast (e.g., demographic 
and settlement patterns), make low-lying islands, coasts and 
communities relevant illustrations of some of the ﬁve Reasons for 
Concern (RFCs) developed by the IPCC since the Third Assessment 
Report (McCarthy et al., 2001; Smith et al., 2001) to assess risks from 
a global perspective. The AR5 Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2014) as well 
as the more recent SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) reﬁned the 
RFC approach. The AR5 Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2014) developed two 
additional RFCs related to the coasts, subsequently updated along 
with the other RFCs (O’Neill et al., 2017). One refers to risks to marine 
species arising from ocean acidiﬁcation, and the other one refers to 
risks to human and natural systems from SLR. Despite the difﬁculty in 
attributing observed impacts to SLR per se (Section 4.3.3.1), O’Neill 
et al. (2017) estimate that risks related to SLR are already detectable 
globally and will increase rapidly, so that high risk may occur before 
a 1m rise level is reached. O’Neill et al. (2017) also suggest that 
limits to coastal protection and EbA by 2100 could occur in a 1 m 
SLR rise scenario. Previous assessments however left gaps, including 
quantifying the beneﬁts from adaptation in terms of risk reduction. 
4.3.4.1 
Methodological Advances
Rather than revisiting the AR5 and O’Neill et al. (2017) assessments 
from the particular perspective of risk related to SLR and for the 
global scale, this section provides a complementary perspective by 
assessing risks for speciﬁc geographies (resource-rich coastal cities, 
urban atoll islands, large tropical agricultural deltas and selected 
Arctic communities), based on the methodological advances below.
Scale of analysis and geographical scope – To date, the RFCs and 
associated burning embers have been developed at a global scale 
(Oppenheimer et al., 2014; Gattuso et al., 2015; O’Neill et al., 2017) 
382
Chapter 4 
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities

and do not address the spatial variability of risk highlighted in this 
report (Sections 4.3.2.7, 4.3.4, 5.3.7, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Box 4.1). 
In addition, assessments usually identify risks either for global human 
dimensions (e.g., to people, livelihood, breakdown of infrastructures, 
biodiversity, global economy, etc.; IPCC, 2014; Oppenheimer et al., 
2014; O’Neill et al., 2017) or for ecosystems and ecosystem services 
(Gattuso et al., 2015; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) (Section 5.3.7). 
This section moves the focus from the global to more local scales 
by considering four generic categories of low-lying coastal areas 
(Figure  4.3, Panel B): selected Arctic communities remote from 
regions of rapid GIA, large tropical agricultural deltas, urban atoll 
islands, and resource-rich coastal cities. Each of these categories is 
informed by several real-world case studies.
Risks considered – In line with the AR5 (IPCC, 2014), current and 
future risks result from the interaction of SLR-related hazards with 
the vulnerability of exposed ecosystems and societies. According 
to the speciﬁc scope of the chapter, this assessment focusses on 
the additional risks due to SLR and does not account for changes 
in extreme event climatology. Hazards considered are coastal 
ﬂooding (Section 4.3.4.2), erosion (Section 4.3.4.3) and salinisation 
(Section  4.3.4.4). The proxies used to describe exposure and 
vulnerability are the density of assets at the coast (Section 4.3.2.2) 
and the level of degradation of natural buffering by marine and 
terrestrial ecosystems (Sections 4.3.2.3, 4.3.3.5.4, and 5.3.2 to 
5.3.4). The assessment especially addresses risks to human assets 
at the coast, including populations, infrastructures and livelihoods. 
Speciﬁc metrics were developed (see SM4.3 for details), and their 
contribution to present-day observed impacts and to end-century risk 
have been assessed based on the authors’ expert judgment and a 
methodological grid presented in SM4.3 (SM4.3.1 to SM4.3.6). The 
author’s expert judgment draws on Sections 4.3.3.2 to 4.3.3.5 as well 
as additional literature for local scale perspectives (SM4.3.9). 
Sea level rise scenarios – Based on the updates for ranges and 
mean values developed in this chapter (Section 4.2, Table 4.3), this 
assessment considers the end-century GMSL (2100) relative to 1986–
2005 levels for two scenarios, SROCC RCP2.6 and SROCC RCP8.5. 
Both mean values and the SROCC RCP8.5 upper end of the likely range 
are used to assess risk transitions (Figure 4.3, Panel A). For the sake 
of readability, the following values were used: 43 cm (mean SROCC 
RCP2.6), 84 cm (mean SROCC RCP8.5) and 110 cm (SROCC RCP8.5 
upper end of likely range). While GMSL serves as a representation of 
different possible climate change scenarios (see Panel A in Figure 4.3, 
Section  4.1.2), the assessment of additional risks due to SLR 
on speciﬁc geographies is developed against end-century relative SLR 
(RSL) in order to allow a geographically accurate approach (Panel B, 
Figure 4.3). Accordingly, risk was assessed to illustrative geographies 
based on RSLs for each of the two SROCC RCP scenarios and each 
of the real-world case studies to (SM4.3.6 and Table SM4.3.2; see 
dotted lines in Panel B of Figure 4.3). RSL observations include some 
or all of the following VLMs: both uplift (e.g., due to tectonics) and 
subsidence due to natural  (e.g., tectonics,  sediment  compaction) 
and human (e.g., oil/gas/water extraction, mining activities) factors, 
as well as to GIA. However, in SROCC, numerical RSL  projections 
only include GIA and the regional gravitational, rotational, and 
deformational responses (GRD, see Section 4.2.1.5) to ice mass loss. 
The main reason is the difﬁculty of projecting the inﬂuence on some 
factors such as human interventions to the end of the century.
Adaptation scenarios – Risk will also depend on the effectiveness 
of coastal societies’ responses to both extreme events and slow onset 
changes. To capture the response dimension, four metrics have been 
considered that refer to the implementation of adequately calibrated 
hard, engineered coastal defences (Section 4.4.2.2), the restoration 
of the degraded ecosystems or the creation of new natural buffers 
areas (Section 4.4.2.2 and 4.4.2.3), planned and local-scale relocation 
(Section 4.4.2.6), and measures to limit human-induced subsidence 
(Sections 4.4.2.2, 4.4.2.5). On these bases, two contrasting adaptation 
scenarios were considered. The ﬁrst one is called ‘No-to-moderate 
response’ (see (A) bars in Panel B, Figure  4.3) and represents a 
business-as-usual scenario where no major additional adaptation 
efforts compared to today are implemented. That is, neither 
substantial intensiﬁcation of current actions nor new types of actions, 
e.g.,  only moderate raising of existing protections in high-density 
areas or sporadic episodes of relocation or beach nourishment where 
largescale efforts are not already underway. The second one, called 
‘Maximum potential response’ (bars (B) in Figure 4.3), refers to an 
ambitious combination of both incremental and transformational 
adaptation (i.e., signiﬁcantly upscaled effort); for example, relocation 
of entire districts or raised protections in some cities, or creation/
restoration at a signiﬁcant scale of beach-dune systems including 
indigenous vegetation. 
4.3.4.2 
Key Findings on Future Risks and Adaptation Beneﬁts
4.3.4.2.1 Future risks 
The ﬁndings suggest that risks from SLR are already detectable for all 
of the geographies considered (Panel B in Figure 4.3), and that risk is 
expected to increase over this century in virtually all low-lying coastal 
areas whatever their context-speciﬁcities or nature (island/continental, 
developed/developing county) (Cross-Chapter Box 9). In the absence 
of high adaptation (bars (A)), risk is expected to signiﬁcantly increase 
in urban atoll islands and the selected Arctic coastal communities 
even in a SROCC RCP2.6 scenario, and all geographies are expected 
to experience almost high to very high risks at the upper likely range 
of SROCC RCP8.5. These results allow reﬁning AR5 conclusions by 
showing, ﬁrst, that high risk can indeed occur before the 1m rise 
benchmark (Oppenheimer et al., 2014; O’Neill et al., 2017) and, second, 
that risk as a function of SLR is highly variable from one geography 
to another. Some rationale is provided below for our assessment of 
illustrative geographies, summarising the more detailed description 
provided in SM4.3 (SM4.3.6 to SM4.3.8). Note however that the 
text below is not intended to be fully comprehensive and does not 
necessarily include all elements for which there is a substantive body 
of literature, nor does it necessarily include all elements which are of 
particular interest to decision makers.
Resource-rich coastal cities (SM4.3.8.1, Panel B in Figure 4.3) – 
Resource-rich coastal cities considered in this analysis are Shanghai, 
New York (see Box 4.1 for further details and references on Shanghai 
and NYC), and Rotterdam (Brinke et al., 2010; Hinkel et al., 2018). 
High, and in many cases, growing population density and total

population, and high exposure of people and infrastructure to 
GMSL rise and ESL events characterise coastal megacities (Hanson 
et al., 2011). These are high concentrations of income and wealth 
in geographic terms but within relatively small area exhibit large 
distributional differences of both with important implications for 
emergency response and adaptation. Concentration translates into 
high exposure of monetary value to coastal hazards and the cities 
noted here have both historical and recent experience with damaging 
ESL events, such as Typhoon Winnie which struck Shanghai in 1997 
(Xian et al., 2018), Hurricane Sandy in New York in 2012 (Rosenzweig 
and Solecki, 2014), and the North Sea storm of 1953 which impacted 
the Rotterdam area (Gerritsen, 2005; Jonkman et al., 2008). However, 
high density, limited space and high cost of land leads to development 
of below-ground space for transportation (e.g.,  subways, road 
tunnels; MTA, 2017) and storage, and even habitation, creating 
vulnerabilities not seen in low-density areas. Natural ecosystems 
within the megacity boundaries and nearby have been exploited for 
centuries and in some cases decimated or even extirpated (Hartig 
et al., 2002). Accordingly, they provide limited beneﬁts in terms of 
coastal protection for the densest part of these cities but can be 
critically important for protection of lower-density areas, for example, 
wetlands and sandy beaches in the Jamaica Bay/Rockaway sector of 
New York that protect nearby residential communities (Hartig et al., 
2002). Space limitations also constrain the potential beneﬁts of EbA 
measures. Instead, resource-rich coastal cities depend largely on 
hard defences like sea walls and surge barriers for coastal protection 
(Section 4.4.2.2). Such defences are costly but generally cost effective 
due to the aforementioned concentration of population and value. 
However, barriers to planning and implementing adaptation include 
governance challenges (Section 4.4.2) such as limited control over 
ﬁnances and the intermittent nature of ESLs which inhibit focused 
attention over the long time scales needed to plan and implement 
hard defences (Section 4.4.2.2). As a result, coastal adaptation for 
resource-rich cities is uneven and the three presented here were 
selected with a view toward exhibiting a range of current and 
potential future effectiveness.
Urban atoll islands (SM4.3.8.2, Panel B in Figure 4.3) – The capital 
islands (or groups of islands) of three atoll nations in the Paciﬁc and 
Indian Oceans are considered here: Fongafale (Funafuti Atoll, Tuvalu), 
the South Tarawa Urban District (Tarawa Atoll, Kiribati) and Male’ 
(North Kaafu Atoll, Maldives). Urban atoll islands have low elevation 
(<4 m above mean sea level; in South Tarawa, e.g., lagoon sides where 
settlement concentrates are <1.80 m in elevation) (Duvat, 2013) and 
are mainly composed of reef-derived unconsolidated material. Their 
future is of nation-wide importance as they concentrate populations, 
economic activities and critical infrastructure (airports, main 
harbours). They illustrate the prominence of anthropogenic-driven 
disturbances to marine and terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., mangrove 
clearing in South Tarawa or human-induced coral reef degradation 
through land reclamation in Male’; Duvat et al., 2013; Naylor, 2015) 
and therefore to services such as coastal protection delivered by the 
coral reef (i.e., wave energy attenuation that reduces ﬂooding and 
erosion, and sediment provision that contributes to island persistence 
over time) (McLean and Kench, 2015; Quataert et al., 2015; Elliff and 
Silva, 2017; Storlazzi et al., 2018).
The controlling factors of urban atoll islands’ future habitability are 
the density of assets exposed to marine ﬂooding and coastal erosion 
(SM4.3.8.2), future trends in these hazards, and ecosystem response 
to both ocean-climate related pressures and human activities. Urban 
atoll islands already experience coastal ﬂooding, for example, 
in Male’ (Wadey et al., 2017) and Funafuti (Yamano et al., 2007; 
McCubbin et al., 2015). Coastal erosion is also a major concern along 
non-armoured shoreline in South Tarawa (Duvat et al., 2013) and 
Fongafale (Onaka et al., 2017), but not in Male’ where surrounding 
fortiﬁcations have extended along almost the entire shoreline 
from several decades (Naylor, 2015). Salinisation already affects 
groundwater lenses, but its contribution to risk varies from one case 
to another, from low in Male’ (relying on desalinised seawater) to 
important for human consumption and agriculture in South Tarawa 
(Bailey et al., 2014; Post et al., 2018). 
Together, high population densities (from ~3,200 people per km2 in 
South Tarawa to ~65,700 people per km2 in Male’) (Government of the 
Maldives, 2014; McIver et al., 2015) and the concentration of critical 
infrastructure and settlements in naturally low-lying ﬂood-prone areas 
already substantially contribute to coastal risk (Duvat et al., 2013; Field 
et al., 2017). Even stabilised densities in the future would translate 
into a substantial increase of risk under a 43cm GMSL rise. Risk will 
also be exacerbated by the negative effects of ocean warming and 
acidiﬁcation, especially on coral reef and mangrove capacity to cope 
with SLR (Pendleton et al., 2016; Van Hooidonk et al., 2016; Perry and 
Morgan, 2017; Perry et al., 2018) (Sections 4.3.3.5, 5.3). In addition, 
even small values of SLR will signiﬁcantly increase risk to atoll islands’ 
aquifers (Bailey et al., 2016; Storlazzi et al., 2018). Finally, land scarcity 
in atoll environments will exacerbate the importance of SLR induced 
damages (on housing, agriculture and infrastructure especially) 
and cascading impacts (on livelihoods, for example, as a result of 
groundwater and soil salinisation). 
Large tropical agricultural deltas (SM4.3.8.3, Panel B in 
Figure 4.3) – River deltas considered in this analysis are the Mekong 
Delta and the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta. Both deltas 
are large, low-lying and dominated by agricultural production. The 
risk assessment to SLR considered the entire delta area (not only 
the coastal fringe; see SM4.3.6 for explanation). High population 
densities (1280 people per km2  and 433 people per km2  in the 
Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Mekong deltas, respectively) 
(Ericson et al., 2006; Government of the Maldives, 2014) and the 
removal of natural vegetation buffers contribute to high exposure 
rates to coastal ﬂooding, erosion, and salinisation. Agricultural 
production contributes to GDP strongly (Smajgl et al., 2015; Hossain 
et al., 2018), making agricultural ﬁelds important assets. In both 
deltas, mangroves are partially degraded (Ghosh et al., 2018; 
Veettil et al., 2018) as well as other wetlands at the coast and 
further inland (Quan et al., 2018a; Rahman et al., 2018). Currently, 
riverine ﬂooding dominates in both deltas (Auerbach et al., 2015; 
Rahman and Rahman, 2015; Ngan et al., 2018). However, high tides 
and cyclones can generate large coastal ﬂooding events, especially 
in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Delta (Auerbach et al., 2015; 
Rahman and Rahman, 2015). Human-induced subsidence increases 
the likelihood of ﬂooding in both deltas (Brown et al., 2018b). 
Coastal and river bank erosion is already a problem in both delta

(Anthony et al., 2015; Brown and Nicholls, 2015; Li et al., 2017) as 
well as salinity intrusion, which is impacting coastal aquifers, soils 
and surface waters (Anthony et al., 2015; Brown and Nicholls, 2015; 
Li et al., 2017). Salinisation of water and soil resources remains a 
coastal phenomenon (Smajgl et al., 2015), but salinity intrusion can 
reach far inland in some extreme years and signiﬁcantly contribute 
to risk at the delta scale (Section 4.3.3.4.2). Both deltas are partly 
protected with hard engineered defences such as dikes and sluice 
gates to prevent riverine ﬂooding, and polders and dikes in some 
coastal stretches to prevent salinity intrusion and storm surges 
(Smajgl et al., 2015; Rogers and Overeem, 2017; Warner et al., 
2018a). Today, in both deltas, the measures implemented to restore 
natural buffers are still limited to mangroves ecosystems (Quan et al., 
2018a; Rahman et al., 2018), and the measures aiming at reducing 
subsidence are underdeveloped (Schmidt, 2015; Schmitt et al., 
2017). Assuming stable population densities in the future, coastal 
ﬂooding will contribute increasingly to risk at the delta level (Brown 
and Nicholls, 2015; Brown et al., 2018a; Dang et al., 2018). Coastal 
erosion will increase (Anthony et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017a; Uddin 
et al., 2019) and salinisation of coastal waters and soils will be more 
signiﬁcant (Tran Anh et al., 2018; Vu et al., 2018; Rakib et al., 2019) 
and will strongly impact agriculture and water supply for the entire 
delta (Jiang et al., 2018; Timsina et al., 2018; Nhung et al., 2019). 
Without increased adaptation, coastal ecosystems will be largely 
destroyed at 110 cm of SLR (Schmitt et al., 2017; Mehvar et al., 2019; 
Mukul et al., 2019). Given the size of these deltas, it is only under 
high emission scenarios, that ﬂooding, erosion and salinisation lead 
to high risk at the entire delta scale.
Arctic communities (SM4.3.8.4, Panel B in Figure 4.3) – Five small 
indigenous settlements located on the Arctic Coastal Plain are 
considered in this analysis: Bykovsky (Lena Delta, Russian Federation), 
Shishmaref and Kivalina (Alaska, USA), and Shingle Point and 
Tuktoyaktuk (Mackenzie Delta, Canada). They lie on exposed coasts 
composed of unlithiﬁed ice-rich sediments in permafrost, in areas 
with seasonal sea ice and slow to moderate SLR. These communities 
have populations ranging from 380 to 900 (fewer and seasonal at 
Shingle Point) that are heavily dependent on marine subsistence 
resources (Forbes, 2011; Ford et al., 2016a). Shishmaref and Kivalina 
are located on low-lying barrier islands highly susceptible to rising 
sea level (Marino, 2012; Bronen and Chapin, 2013; Fang et al., 2018; 
Rolph et al., 2018). Shingle Point is situated on an active gravel spit; 
Tuktoyaktuk is built on low ground with high concentrations of 
massive ice; and Bykovsky is mostly situated on an ice-rich eroding 
terrace about 20 m above sea level. All the selected communities are 
remote from regions of rapid positive GIA; many other areas in the 
Arctic experience rapid GIA uplift (James et al., 2015; Forbes et al., 
2018) and have very low sensitivity to SLR, which may in fact help to 
reduce shoaling.
Especially in the Arctic, anthropogenic drivers in recent decades 
resulted in the induced settlement of indigenous peoples in 
marginalised climate-sensitive communities (Ford et al., 2016b) 
and the construction of infrastructure in nearshore areas, with the 
assumption of stable coastlines. This resulted in increased exposure 
to coastal hazards. Coastal erosion is already a major problem in 
all of the case studies, where space for building is usually limited. 
Accelerating permafrost thaw is promoting rapid erosion of ice-rich 
sediments, e.g.,  at Bykovsky (Myers, 2005; Lantuit et al., 2011; 
Vanderlinden et al., 2018) and Tuktoyaktuk (Lamoureux et al., 2015; 
Ford et al., 2016a). Related to this, Kivalina, Shishmaref, Shingle 
Point, Tuktoyaktuk, and parts of the Lena delta (less so for Bykovsky) 
are already facing high risk of ﬂooding. Shishmaref, for example, 
experienced 10 ﬂooding events between 1973 and 2015 that resulted 
in emergency declarations (Bronen and Chapin, 2013; Lamoureux 
et al., 2015; Irrgang et al., 2019). There is however no evidence of 
salinisation in the selected communities, but brackish water ﬂooding 
of the outer Mackenzie Delta caused by a 1999 storm surge (a rare 
event due to upwelling ahead of the storm) led to widespread die-off 
of vegetation with negative ecosystem impacts (Pisaric et al., 2011; 
Kokelj et al., 2012).
Permafrost thaw is already accelerating due to increasing ground 
temperatures that weaken the mechanical stability of frozen ground 
(Section  3.4.2.2). Arctic SLR and sea surface warming have the 
potential to substantially contribute to this thawing (Forbes, 2011; 
Barnhart et al., 2014b; Lamoureux et al., 2015; Fritz et al., 2017). 
An additional factor unique to the polar regions is the decrease 
in seasonal sea ice extent in the Arctic (Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2), 
which together with a lengthening open water season, provides less 
protection from storm impacts, particularly later in the year when 
storms are prevalent (Forbes, 2011; Lantuit et al., 2011; Barnhart 
et al., 2014a; Melvin et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2018; Forbes, 2019) and 
therefore reduces the physical protection of the land (Section 6.3.1.3). 
4.3.4.2.2 Adaptation beneﬁts
The assessment also shows that beneﬁts in terms of risk reduction 
over this century are to be expected from ambitious adaptation efforts 
(bars (B), Sections 4.4.2, 4.4.3 and 4.4.3). In the case of resource-rich 
coastal cities especially, adequately engineered coastal defences can 
play a decisive role in reducing risk (Section 4.4.2.2, Box 4.1), for 
example from high to moderate at the SROCC RCP8.5 upper likely 
range. In other contexts, such as atoll islands for example, while 
engineered protection structures will reduce risk of ﬂooding, they will 
not necessarily prevent seawater inﬁltration due to the permeable 
nature of the island substratum. So even adequate coastal protection 
would not eliminate risk (SM4.3.8.3). In urban atoll islands, large 
tropical agricultural deltas and the selected Arctic communities, 
ambitious adaptation efforts mixing adequate coastal defences, the 
restoration and creation of buffering ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs), 
and a moderate amount of relocation are expected to reduce risk. For 
resource-rich coastal cities, adequately engineered hard protection 
can virtually eliminate risk of ﬂooding up to 84  cm except for 
residual risk of structural failure (Sections 4.4.2 to 4.4.5). Beneﬁts 
are relatively important in a 84  cm SLR scenario, as they reduce 
risk from high-to-very-high to moderate-to-high (atolls, Arctic) and 
from moderate-to-high to moderate (deltas). These beneﬁts become 
more modest when approaching the upper likely range of SROCC 
RCP8.5, and risk tends to return to high-to-very-high (atolls, Arctic) 
levels once the 110 cm rise in sea level is reached. Noteworthy in 
urban atoll islands, intensiﬁed proactive coastal relocation (e.g., 
relocation of buildings and infrastructures that are very close to the 
shoreline) is expected to play a substantial role in risk reduction 
385

under all SLR scenarios. Proactive relocation can indeed compensate 
for the increasing extent of coastal ﬂooding and associated damages 
(SM4.3.8.3). When taken to the extreme, relocation could lead to the 
elimination of risk in situ, for example in the case of the relocation 
of the full population of urban atoll islands either elsewhere in 
the country (e.g., on another island) or abroad (i.e.,  international 
migration). This is an extreme situation where it is hard to distinguish 
whether the measure is an impact of SLR (and ocean change more 
broadly), for example, displacement, or an adaptation solution. In 
addition, relocation of people displaces pressure to destination areas, 
with a potential increase of risk for the latter. In other words, the 
broader ‘coastal retreat’ category (Section 4.4.2.6) raises the issue 
of the ‘limits to adaptation’, which is not represented in Figure 4.3. 
These conclusions must be nuanced, ﬁrst, by the fact that our 
assessment does not consider either ﬁnancial or social aspects that 
can act as limiting factors to the development of adaptation options 
(Sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.5), for instance, hard engineering coastal 
defences (Hurlimann et al., 2014; Jones et al., 2014; Elrick-Barr et al., 
2017; Hinkel et al., 2018). However, from a general perspective, 
these ﬁndings suggest that although ambitious adaptation will 
not necessarily eradicate end-century risk from SLR across all 
low-lying coastal areas around the world, it will help to buy time 
in many locations and therefore contribute to developing a robust 
foundation for adaptation beyond 2100. Second, the future of other 
climate-related drivers of risk (such as ESL, waves and cyclones; 
Sections 4.2.3.4.1 to 4.2.3.4.3, 6.3.1.1 to 6.3.1.3) is not fully and 
systematically included in each risk assessment above, so that much 
larger risks than assessed here are to be expected.
4.4 
Responding to Sea Level Rise
4.4.1 
Introduction
SLR responses refer to legislation, plans and actions undertaken to 
reduce risk and build resilience in the face of SLR (see Cross-Chapter 
Box 3 in Chapter 1). These responses range from protecting the coast, 
accommodating SLR impacts, retreating from the coast, advancing 
into the ocean by building seawards and EbA (Box 4.3). Identifying 
the most appropriate way to respond to SLR is not straightforward 
and is politically and socially contested with a range of governance 
challenges (also called barriers) arising. This section ﬁrst assesses 
the post-AR5 literature on the different types of SLR responses 
(i.e., protection, accommodation, advance, retreat and EbA) in terms 
of their effectiveness, technical limits, costs, beneﬁts, co-beneﬁts, 
drawbacks, economic efﬁciency and barriers, and the speciﬁc 
governance challenges associated with each type of response 
(Section  4.4.2). It then identiﬁes a set of overarching governance 
challenges that arise from the nature of SLR, such as its long-term 
commitment and uncertainty, and the associated politically and 
socially contested choices that need to be made (Section 4.4.3). Next, 
planning, public participation, conﬂict resolution and decision analysis 
approaches and tools are assessed that, when applied in combination, 
can help to address the governance challenges identiﬁed, facilitating 
social choices about SLR responses (Section 4.4.4). Finally, enablers 
and lessons learned from practical efforts to implement SLR responses 
are assessed (Section 4.4.5), concluding with a synthesis emphasising 
the utility of climate resilient development pathways (Section 4.4.6).
Box 4.3 |  Responses to Sea Level Rise
Protection reduces coastal risk and impacts by blocking the inland propagation and other effects of mean or extreme sea levels (ESL). 
This includes: i) hard protection such as dikes, seawalls, breakwaters, barriers and barrages to protect against ﬂooding, erosion and 
salt water intrusion (Nicholls, 2018), ii) sediment-based protection such as beach and shore nourishment, dunes (also referred to as 
soft structures), and iii) ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) (see below). The three subcategories are often applied in combination as 
so-called hybrid measures. Examples are a marsh green-belt in front of a sea wall, or a sea wall especially designed to include niches 
for habitat formation (Coombes et al., 2015).
Accommodation includes diverse biophysical and institutional responses that mitigate coastal risk and impacts by reducing the 
vulnerability of coastal residents, human activities, ecosystems and the built environment, thus enabling the habitability of coastal 
zones despite increasing levels of hazard occurrence. Accommodation measures for erosion and ﬂooding include building codes, raising 
house elevation (e.g., on stilts), lifting valuables to higher ﬂoors and ﬂoating houses and gardens (Trang, 2016). Accommodation 
measures for salinity intrusion include changes in land use (e.g., rice to brackish/salt shrimp aquaculture) or changes to salt tolerant 
crop varieties. Institutional accommodation responses include EWS, emergency planning, insurance schemes and setback zones (Nurse 
et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014).
Advance creates new land by building seaward, reducing coastal risks for the hinterland and the newly elevated land. This includes land 
reclamation above sea levels by land ﬁlling with pumped sand or other ﬁll material, planting vegetation with the speciﬁc intention to 
support natural accretion of land and surrounding low areas with dikes, termed polderisation, which also requires drainage and often 
pumping systems (Wang et al., 2014; Donchyts et al., 2016).
Retreat reduces coastal risk by moving exposed people, assets and human activities out of the coastal hazard zone. This includes the 
following three forms: i) Migration, which is the voluntary permanent or semi-permanent movement by a person at least for one year 
(Adger et al., 2014). ii) Displacement, which refers to the involuntary and unforeseen movement of people due to environment-related 
386

impacts or political or military unrest (Black et al., 2013; Islam and Khan, 2018; McLeman, 2018; Mortreux et al., 2018). iii) Relocation, 
also termed resettlement, managed retreat or managed realignment, which is typically initiated, supervised and implemented by 
governments from national to local levels and usually involves small sites and/or communities (Wong et al., 2014; Hino et al., 2017; 
Mortreux et al., 2018). Managed realignment may also be conducted for the purpose of creating new habitat. These three sub-categories 
are not neatly separable– any household’s decision to retreat may be ‘voluntary’ in theory, but in practice, may result from very limited 
choices. Displacement certainly occurs in response to extreme events but some of those retreating may have other options. Relocation 
programs may rely on incentives such as land buyouts that households adopt voluntarily. The need for retreat and other response 
measures can be reduced by avoiding new development commitments in areas prone to severe SLR hazards (Section 4.4.4.2).
Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) responses provide a combination of protect and advance beneﬁts based on the sustainable 
management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems (Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2017). Examples include the conservation or 
restoration of coastal ecosystems such as wetlands and reefs. EbA measures protect the coastline by (i) attenuating waves, and, in 
the case of wetlands storm surge ﬂows, by acting as obstacles and providing retention space (Krauss et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012; 
Vuik et al., 2015; Rupprecht et al., 2017); and (ii) by raising elevation and reducing rates of erosion through trapping and stabilising 
coastal sediments (Shepard et al., 2011), as well as building-up of organic matter and detritus (Shepard et al., 2011; McIvor et al., 
2012a; McIvor et al., 2012b; Cheong et al., 2013; McIvor et al., 2013; Spalding et al., 2014). EbA is also referred to by various other 
names, including Natural and Nature-based Features, Nature-based Solutions, Ecological Engineering, Ecosystem-based Disaster 
Risk Reduction or Green Infrastructure (Bridges, 2015; Pontee et al., 2016).

Types of Responses and Framework for Assessment
Following

IPCC 
Reports 
Protection,

and 
Accommodation responses to SLR and its impacts are distinguished 
between (Nicholls et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2014), and Advance is 
added as a fourth type of response that consists in building seaward 
and upward (Box 4.3). Advance had not received much attention in 
the climate change literature but plays an important role in coastal 
development across the world (e.g.,  Institution of Civil Engineers, 
2010; Lee, 2014; Donchyts et al., 2016). The broader term response 
is used here instead of adaptation, because some responses such as 
retreat may or may not be meaningfully considered to be adaptation 
(Hinkel et al., 2018). Responses that address the causes of climate 
change, such as mitigating GHGs or geoengineering temperature and 
sea level responses to emissions fall beyond the scope of this chapter, 
and are addressed in SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). In coastal 
areas where anthropogenic subsidence contributes to relative SLR, 
another important type of response is the management of subsidence 
by, for instance, restricting ground ﬂuid abstraction. Although this 
type of measure is considered in the risk assessment developed in 
Section 4.3.4, it is not assessed here due to a lack of space.
Observed coastal responses are rarely responses to climate-change 
induced SLR only, but also to relative SLR caused by land subsidence 
as well as current coastal risks and many socioeconomic factors and 
related hazards. As a consequence, coastal responses have been

practised for centuries, and there are many experiences speciﬁcally in 
places that have subsided up to several metres due to earthquakes 
or anthropogenic ground ﬂuid abstraction in the last century that 
responding to climate-change induced SLR can draw upon (Esteban 
et al., 2019). Finally, in practise, many responses are hybrid, applying 
combinations of protection, accommodation, retreat, advance and EbA. 
Since AR5, the literature on SLR responses has grown signiﬁcantly. It 
is assessed in this section for the ﬁve above-described broad types of 
responses in terms of the following six criteria:
• Observed responses across geographies, describing where the 
different types of responses have been implemented.
• Projected responses, which refers to the potential extent of 
responses in the future, as assessed in the literature through 
modelling or in a more qualitative way.
• Cost of responses, which refers to the costs of implementing 
and maintaining responses. Other costs that arise due to negative 
side-effects of implementing a response are captured under the 
criterion ‘co-beneﬁts and drawbacks’.
• Effectiveness of responses in terms of reducing SLR risks and 
impacts. This includes biophysical and technical limits beyond 
which responses cease to be effective.
• Co-beneﬁts and drawbacks of responses that occur next to the 
intended beneﬁts of reducing SLR risks and impacts.
• Governance challenges (or barriers), which refers to 
institutional and organisational factors that have been found to 
hinder the effective, efﬁcient and equitable implementation of 
responses (see also Section 4.4.3).
• Economic efﬁciency of responses, which refers to the overall 
monetised balance of costs, beneﬁts (in terms of the effectiveness 
of responses), co-beneﬁts and drawbacks. Economic barriers arise 
if responses have a negative net beneﬁt or a beneﬁt-cost ratio 
smaller than one. While it would be desirable to have information 
on the economic efﬁciency of integrated responses combining 
different response types, an assessment cannot be provided here 
due to the lack of literature.
4.4.2.2 
Hard and Sediment-Based Protection 
4.4.2.2.1 Observed hard and sediment-based protection 
across geographies 
Coastal protection through hard measures is widespread around 
the world, although it is difﬁcult to provide estimates on how many 
people beneﬁt from them. Currently, at least 20  million people 
living below normal high tides are protected by hard structures (and 
drainage) in countries such as Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, 
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Thailand, the UK, and the 
USA (Nicholls, 2010). Many more people living above high tides are 
also protected against ESL by hard structures in major cities around 
the world. There is a concentration of these measures in northwest 
Europe and East Asia, although extensive defences are also found in 
and around many coastal cities and deltas. For example, large scale 
coastal protection exists in Vancouver (Canada), Alexandria (Egypt) 
and Keta (Ghana; Nairn et al., 1999) and 6000 km of polder dikes 
in coastal Bangladesh. Gittman et al. (2015) estimate that 14% of 
the total US coastline has been armoured, with New Orleans being 
an example of an area below sea level dependent on extensive 
engineered protection (Kates et al., 2006; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 
2014; Cooper et al., 2016). Defences built and raised for tsunami 
protection, such as post-2011 in Japan (Raby et al., 2015), also 
provide protection against SLR.
The application of sediment-based protection measures also has 
a long history, offering multiple beneﬁts in terms of enhancing 
safety, recreation and natural systems (JSCE, 2000; Dean, 2002; 
Hanson et al., 2002; Cooke et al., 2012). About 24% of the world’s 
sandy beaches are currently eroding by rates faster than 0.5 m yr–1 
(Luijendijk et al., 2018). In the USA, Europe and Australia, these 
responses are often driven by the recreational value of beaches and 
the high economic beneﬁts associated with beach tourism. More 
recently, sediment-based measures are implemented as effective 
and yet ﬂexible measures to address SLR (Kabat et al., 2009) and 
experiments are being conducted with innovative decadal scale 
application of sediments such as the sand engine in the Netherlands 
(Stive et al., 2013). 
There is high conﬁdence that most major upgrades in defences 
happen after coastal disasters (Box  4.1). Dikes were raised and 
reienforced after the devastating coastal ﬂood of 1953 in the 
Netherlands and the UK, and in 1962 in Germany. In New Orleans, 
investments in the order of 15 billion USD, including a major storm 
surge barrier, followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Fischetti, 2015), 
and in New York the Federal Government made available 16 billion 
USD for disaster recovery and adaptation after Superstorm Sandy 
in 2012 (NYC, 2015). Examples in which SLR has been considered 
proactively in the planning process include SLR safety margins in, for 
example, the UK, Germany and France, upgrading defences according 
to cost-beneﬁt analysis in the Netherlands, and SLR guidance in the 
USA (USACE, 2011).
4.4.2.2.2 Projected hard and sediment-based protection 
There is high conﬁdence that hard coastal protection will continue 
to be a widespread response to SLR in densely populated and 
urban areas during the 21st century, because this response is 
widely practised (Section  4.4.2.2.2), effective in reducing current 
(Section 4.4.2.2.2) and future ﬂood risk (Section 4.3.3.2) and highly 
cost efﬁcient in urban and densely populated areas (Section 4.4.2.7). 
There is, however, low agreement on the level of hard coastal 
protections to expect, with projections being based on different 
assumptions. A model assuming that coastal societies upgrade hard 
protection following scenario-based cost-beneﬁt analysis ﬁnds that 
22% of the global coastline will be protected under various SSPs and 
1 m of 21st century global mean SLR (Nicholls et al., 2019). Another 
model assuming that only areas for which beneﬁt-cost ratios are 
above 1 under SLR scenarios up to 2 m, all SSPs and discount rates 
up to 6%, ﬁnds that this would lead to protecting 13% of the global 
coastline (Lincke and Hinkel, 2018; Figure 4.14).

4.4.2.2.3 Cost of hard and sediment-based protection 
There is medium evidence and medium agreement on the costs of 
hard protection. Data on the costs of hard defences is only available 
for few countries and unit costs estimated from this data vary 
substantially depending on building/ﬁll material used, labour cost, 
urban versus rural settings, hydraulic loads, etc. (Jonkman et al., 2013; 
Lenk et al., 2017; Aerts, 2018; Nicholls et al., 2019). In general, there 
has been limited systematic data collection across sites, although 
useful national guidance does exist in some cases (Environment 
Agency, 2015). Defences depend on good maintenance to remain 
effective. For some types of infrastructure such as surge barriers, 
maintenance costs are poorly described and hence more uncertain 
(Nicholls et al., 2007). Protection-based adaptation to saltwater 
intrusion is more complex than adaptation to ﬂooding and erosion, 
and there is less experience to draw upon. 
Based on these unit cost estimates, and different assumptions 
on future protection, global annual protection costs have been 
estimated to be 12–71  billion USD considering coastal dikes only 
(Hinkel et al., 2014) and about 40–170 billion USD yr–1 considering 
coastal dikes, river dikes and storm surge barriers, under RCP2.6, and 
about 25–200 billion USD yr–1 considering coastal dikes only (Tamura 
et al. 2019) under RCP8.5. If protection is widely practised through 
the 21st century, the bulk of the costs will be maintenance rather 
than capital costs (Nicholls et al., 2019).
Sediment-based measures are generally costed as the unit cost of 
sand (or gravel) delivery multiplied by the volumetric demand. Unit 
costs range from 3–21 USD m–³ sand, with some high outlier costs 
in, for example, the UK, South Africa and New Zealand (Linham 
et al., 2010; Aerts, 2018). Costs are small where sources of sand are 
plentiful and close to the sites of demand. Costs are further reduced 
by shoreface nourishment approaches. The Netherlands maintains its 
entire open coast with large-scale shore nourishment (Mulder et al., 
2011) and the innovative sand engine has been implemented as a 
full-scale decadal experiment (Stive et al., 2013). The capital costs 
for dunes are similar to beach nourishment, although placement and 
planting vegetation may raise costs. Maintenance costs vary from 
almost nothing to several million USD km–1, although costs are 
usually at the lower end of this range (Environment Agency, 2015).
4.4.2.2.4 Effectiveness of hard and sediment-based protection 
There is high conﬁdence that well designed and maintained hard and 
sediment-based protection is very effective in reducing risk to the 
impacts of SLR and ESL (Horikawa, 1978; USACE, 2002; CIRIA, 2007). 
This includes situations in which coastal megacities in river deltas have 
experienced, and adapted to, relative SLR of several metres caused by 
land subsidence during the 20th century (Kaneko and Toyota, 2011; 
Esteban et al., 2019; Box 4.1). In principle, there are no technological 
limits to protect the coast during the 21st century even under high-end 
SLR of 2 m (Section 4.3.3.2), but technological challenges can make 
protection very expensive and hence unaffordable in some areas 
(Hinkel et al., 2018). Examples include southeast Florida, because 
protected areas can be ﬂooded by rising groundwater through 
underlying porous limestone (Bloetscher et al., 2011). Gradually rising 
water tables behind defences is also an issue, which can be managed 
by increasing pumping and drainage (Aerts, 2018). Maintaining this 
effectiveness over time requires regular monitoring and maintenance, 
accounting for changing conditions such as SLR and widespread 
erosional trends in front of the defences. There will always be residual 
risks, which can be reduced, but never eliminated, by engineering 
protection infrastructure to very high standards, such as so-called 
‘unbreakable dikes’ (de Bruijn et al., 2013). 
It is difﬁcult to assess at what point in time and for which amount 
of SLR technical limits for coastal protection will be reached. Parts of 
Tokyo have been protected against ﬁve metres of relative SLR during 
the 21st century (Kaneko and Toyota, 2011) and it has been argued 
that it is possible to preserve territorial integrity of the Netherlands 
even under 5 m SLR, using current engineering technology (Aerts 
et al., 2008; Olsthoorn et al., 2008). This suggests that under RCP2.6, 
technical limits to adaptation will be rare even under longer-term 
SLR. Protecting against high-end SLR will be increasingly technically 
challenging as we move beyond the 21st century. This is not only due 
to the absolute amount of SLR, but also due to the very high rates of 
annual SLR (e.g., 10–20 mm yr–1 likely range under RCP8.5 in 2100), 
which challenge the planning and implementation of hard protection 
because major protection infrastructure requires decades to plan and 
implement (Gilbert et al., 1984; Burcharth et al., 2014). In summary, 
the higher and faster SLR, the more challenging coastal protection 
will be, but quantifying this is difﬁcult. In any case, before technical 
limits are reached, economic and social limits will be reached because 
societies are neither economically able nor socially willing to invest in 
coastal protection (Sections 4.4.2.2 and 4.3.3.2; Hinkel et al., 2018; 
Esteban et al., 2019).

4.4.2.2.5 Co-beneﬁts and drawbacks of hard  
and sediment-based protection 
When space is limited (e.g.,  in an urban setting), co-beneﬁts can 
be generated through multi-functional hard ﬂood defences, which 
combine ﬂood protection with other urban functions, such as car 
parks, buildings, roads or recreational spaces into one multifunctional 
structure (Stalenberg, 2013; van Loon-Steensma and Vellinga, 2014). 
An important co-beneﬁt of sediment-based protection, such as beach 
nourishment and dune management, is that it preserves beach and 
associated environments, as well as tourism (Everard et al., 2010; 
Hinkel et al., 2013a; Stive et al., 2013). 
Drawbacks of hard protection include the alteration of hydrodynamic 
and morphodynamic patterns, which in turn may export ﬂooding and 
erosion problems downdrift (Masselink and Gehrels, 2015; Nicholls 
et al., 2015). For example, protection of existing shoreline in estuaries 
and tidal creeks may increase tidal ampliﬁcation in the upper parts 
(Lee et al., 2017). Hard protection also hinders or prohibits the 
onshore migration of geomorphic features and ecosystems (called 
coastal squeeze; Pontee, 2013; Gittman et al., 2016), leading to both 
a loss of habitat as well as of the protection function of ecosystems 
(see Sections 4.3.2.4 and 4.4.2.2). Another drawback of raising 
hard structures, also emphasised in AR5, is the risk of lock-in to a 
development pathway in which development intensiﬁes behind 
higher and higher defences, with escalating severe consequences in 
the event of protection failure (Wong et al., 2014; Welch et al., 2017), 
as experienced in Hurricane Katrina impacted New Orleans (Burby, 
2006; Freudenburg et al., 2009). This lock-in results from protection 
attracting further economic development in the ﬂood zone within 
defenses, which then leads to further raising defences with SLR, and 
the growing value of exposed assets. 
Seabed dredging of sand and gravel can have negative impacts on 
marine ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and corals (Erftemeijer 
and Lewis III, 2006; Erftemeijer et al., 2012). Nourishment practices 
on sandy beaches have also been shown to have drawbacks for local 
ecosystems if local habitat factors are not taken into consideration 
when planning and implementing nourishment and maintenance 
(Speybroeck et al., 2006). A further emerging issue is beach material 
scarcity mainly driven by demand of sand and gravel for construction, 
but also for beach and shore nourishment (Peduzzi, 2014; Torres 
et al., 2017), which makes sourcing the increasing volumes of 
beach materials required to sustain beaches in the face of SLR more 
expensive and challenging (Roelvink, 2015).
4.4.2.2.6 Governance of hard and sediment-based protection
Reviews and comparative case studies conﬁrm ﬁndings of AR5 that 
governance challenges are amongst the most common hindrance to 
implementing coastal measures (Ekstrom and Moser, 2014; Hinkel 
et al., 2018). One main issue to resolve is conﬂicting stakeholder 
interests. This includes conﬂicts between those favouring protection 
and those being negatively affected by adaptation measures. 
In Catalonia, for example, the tourism sector welcomes beach 
nourishment because it provides direct beneﬁts, whereas those 
dependent upon natural resources (e.g., ﬁshermen) are increasingly 
in opposition because they fear that sand mining destroys coastal 
habitat and livelihood prospects (González-Correa et al., 2008). 
There is also conﬂict related to the distribution of public money 
between communities receiving public support for adaptation and 
non-coastal communities who pay for this support through taxes 
(Elrick-Barr et al., 2015). Generally, access to ﬁnancial resources 
for adaptation, including from public sources, development and 
climate ﬁnance or capital markets, frequently constrain adaptation 
(Ekstrom and Moser, 2014; Hinkel et al., 2018). For example, 
homeowners are often not willing to pay taxes or levies for public 
protection or sediment-base measures even if they directly beneﬁt, 
as found, for example in communities on the US east coast where 
beach nourishment is used to maintain recreational and tourism 
amenities (Mullin et al., 2019). In many parts of the world, coastal 
adaptation governance is further complicated by existing conﬂicts 
over resources. For example, illegal coastal sand mining is currently a 
major driver of coastal erosion in many parts of the developing world 
(Peduzzi, 2014). Examples of this can be found in Ghana (Addo, 2015) 
and the Comoros (Betzold and Mohamed, 2017).
An associated governance challenge is ensuring the effective 
maintenance of coastal protection. Ineffective maintenance has 
contributed to many coastal disasters in the past, such as in 
New Orleans (Andersen, 2007). AR5 highlighted that effective 
maintenance is challenging in a small island context due to a lack 
of adequate funds, policies and technical skills (Nurse et al., 2014). 
In some countries in which coastal defence systems have a long 
history, effective governance arrangements for maintenance, such as 
the Water Boards in the Netherlands, have emerged. In Bangladesh, 
where Dutch-like polders were introduced in the 1960s, maintenance 
has been a challenge due to shifts in multi-level governance 
structures associated with independence, national policy priorities 
and donor involvement (Dewan et al., 2015).
4.4.2.2.7 Economic efﬁciency of hard  
and sediment-based protection
At global scales, new economic assessments of responses have 
mostly focused on the direct costs of hard protection and the 
beneﬁts of reducing coastal extreme event ﬂood risks. These studies 
conﬁrm AR5 ﬁndings that the beneﬁts of reducing coastal ﬂood 
risk through hard protection exceed the costs of protection, on a 
global average, and for cities and densely populated areas, during 
the 21st century even under high-end SLR (medium evidence, high 
agreement; Hallegatte et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2014; Diaz, 2016; 
Lincke and Hinkel, 2018). For example, Lincke and Hinkel (2018) ﬁnd 
that, during the 21st century, it is economically efﬁcient to protect 
13% of the global coastline, which corresponds to 90% of global 
ﬂoodplain population, under SLR scenarios from 0.3–2.0 m, ﬁve 
SSPs and discount rates up to 6% (Figure 4.14). While the above 
two studies have not considered the effects of hard protection in 
reducing the area of coastal wetlands, it is expected that coastal hard 
protection in densely populated areas and conserving wetlands in 
sparsely populated areas can go hand in hand. Protecting less than 
42% of the global coastline would leave coastal wetlands sufﬁcient 
accommodation space to even grow in areas under rising sea levels 
390

during the 21st century (Schuerch et al., 2018). Diaz (2016), who 
includes the cost of wetland loss, using a simpler wetland model, 
ﬁnds that both protection and retreat reduce the global net present 
costs of SLR by a factor of seven as compared to no adaptation 
(applying a discount rate of 4%) under 21st century SLR of 0.3–1.3 m 
and SSP2. There is no global study that has considered social costs 
and beneﬁts of responses (e.g., health, beach amenity, etc.) or looked 
at the economics of accommodate, retreat and advance responses.
At local scales, a large number of economic assessments of response 
options are available but mostly in the grey literature and again with 
a focus on hard and sediment-based protection. Similar to the global 
studies, hard protection is generally found to be economically efﬁcient 
for urban and densely populated areas such as New York, USA (Aerts 
et al., 2014) and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (Scussolini et al., 2017). 
Both global and local studies show that sediment-based protection, 
such as beach nourishment is economically efﬁcient in areas of 
intensive tourism development due to the large revenues generated 
within this sector (Rigall-I-Torrent et al., 2011; Hinkel et al., 2013a). 
4.4.2.3 
Ecosystem-based Adaptation
4.4.2.3.1 Observed ecosystem-based adaptation 
across geographies 
Relative to hard adaptation measures whose global distribution 
is not known in detail (Scussolini et al., 2015), the current global 
distribution of coastal ecosystems is well-studied (e.g.,  for 
saltmarshes and mangroves, respectively; Giri et al., 2011; Mcowen 
et al., 2017). EbA, by deﬁnition, can only exist and function where 
the environmental conditions are appropriate for a given ecosystem. 
Mangroves, salt marshes and reefs occur along about 40–50% of the 
world’s coastlines (Wessel and Smith, 1996; Burke, 2011; Giri et al., 
2011; Mcowen et al., 2017). However, there is no clear estimate on 
the global length of coastline covered by ecosystems relevant for 
EbA in the face of SLR in part because of a mismatch between the 
spatial resolutions of different estimates available. Mangroves occur 
on tropical and subtropical coasts, and cover 138,000–152,000 km2 
across about 120 countries (Spalding et al., 2010; Giri et al., 2011). 
At least 150,000 km of coastline in over 100 countries beneﬁt from 
the presence of coral reefs (Burke, 2011) and these are estimated to 
protect over 100 million people from wave-induced ﬂooding globally 
(Ferrario et al., 2014). The extent of other coastal habitats is less well 
known: salt marshes are estimated to occur in 99 countries, especially 
in temperature to high latitude locations, with nearly 5,500,000 ha 
mapped across 43 countries (Mcowen et al., 2017).
Since AR5 there has been growing recognition of the value of 
conserving existing coastal ecosystems, and where possible restoring 
them, for the ﬂood protection and multiple other beneﬁts they 
provide (Temmerman et al., 2013; Arkema et al., 2015). In parallel, 
EbA measures are increasingly being incorporated and required 
within national plans, strategies and targets (Lo, 2016), international 
adaptation funding mechanisms, such as the Adaptation Fund (AF; 
e.g., in Sri Lanka and India; Epple et al., 2016), and national natural 
capital valuations (Beck and Lange, 2016). Given their relative 
novelty, there is widespread interest in building and collecting 
knowledge of EbA implementation case-studies and examples

(Table 4.7). Meanwhile, coastal communities around the globe are 
already implementing EbA responses at local scales, with emphasis 
on community participation and ownership and local priorities, needs 
and capacities (Reid, 2016; see Section 4.4.4.4). 
EbA has been used as an integral part of some retreat, advance 
and accommodation responses. For example, on coastlines where 
high-risk properties are relocated inland, space can be made for 
ecosystem restoration to enhance natural biodiversity and provide 
coastal protection (French, 2006; Coastal Protection and Restoration 
Authority of Louisiana, 2017). There are also examples of ecosystem 
restoration to advance coastlines and build land elevation (Chung, 
2006). EbA can also be an element of accommodation responses by, 
for example, restoring or creating marshes to provide space for ﬂood 
water (Temmerman et al., 2013). 
4.4.2.3.2 Projected ecosystem-based adaptation 
While there are projections available of ecosystem responses 
to climate change and SLR (Section  4.3.3), to date, there are no 
large-scale projections available on the future extent of EbA. However, 
several coastal nations, particularly Small Island Developing States 
(SIDS) explicitly advocate EbA measures as a means to address future 
coastal hazard and SLR concerns. Based on Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs) submitted to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), more than 30 SIDS cite 
EbA as a preferred SLR response, with mangrove planting being the 
most common measure (Wong, 2018). 
4.4.2.3.3 Cost of ecosystem-based adaptation 
There is limited evidence and low agreement on the costs of 
ecosystem-based measures to make generally valid estimations 
of the unit costs across large spatial scales. The total cost of an 
ecosystem-based measure includes capital costs, maintenance costs, 
the cost of land and, in some situations, permitting costs (Bilkovic, 
2017). The costs of restoring and maintaining coastal habitats depend 
on coastal setting, habitat type and project conditions. In general, unit 
restoration costs are lowest for mangroves, higher for salt marshes and 
oyster reefs, and highest for seagrass beds and coral reefs (Table 4.8).
The conservation of coral reefs and other coastal habitats may 
also entail substantial opportunity costs because alternative uses 
of this land, such as through agricultural production, industry and 
settlements, are generally of high economic value (Stewart et al., 
2003; Balmford et al., 2004; Adams et al., 2011; Hunt, 2013). The high 
value of these alternative uses are the reason why globally, coastal 
ecosystems are amongst the ecosystems that face the highest rates 
of anthropogenic destruction, with estimated annual losses of 1–3% 
of mangroves area, 2–5% seagrass area and 4–9% corals (Duarte 
et al., 2013). Conserving these areas means reversing these trends.
Under the right conditions, and to some extent, EbA measures are 
free of maintenance costs, because they respond and adapt to 
changes in their coastal environment. However, maintenance can 
become important in the aftermath of damage by storms or human 
action, for example, when wetlands and reefs can be damaged by 
high winds, waves and surges, or affected by dredging operations 
(Smith III et al., 2009; Puotinen et al., 2016). At present, there is 
limited evidence about the conditions under which EbA measures 
can self-adapt and when they require human intervention to recover. 
4.4.2.3.4 Effectiveness of ecosystem-based adaptation
While EbA has been able to reduce the impacts of sea level related 
hazards, there is still little agreement on the size of the effect 
(Gedan et al., 2011; Doswald et al., 2012; Lo, 2016; Renaud et al., 
2016). Dozens of independent ﬁeld, experimental and numerical 
studies have observed and measured the wave attenuation and 
ﬂood reduction beneﬁts provided by natural habitats, such as marsh 
and mangrove wetlands (Barbier and Enchelmeyer, 2014; Möller 
et al., 2014; Rupprecht et al., 2017), coral reefs (Ferrario et al., 
2014; Storlazzi et al., 2017), oyster reefs (Scyphers et al., 2011) and 
submerged seagrass beds (Infantes et al., 2012). Local and global 
numerical studies indicate that marshes and mangroves can reduce 
present-day surge-related ﬂood damages by >15% annually, and the 
loss of a metre of living coral reef can double annual wave-related 
ﬂood damages (Narayan et al., 2017; Beck et al., 2018). Artiﬁcial reef 
restoration along tens of metres of coastline using Reef Ball™ and 
other structures has been shown to reduce wave heights and stabilise 
beach widths (Reguero et al., 2018a; Torres-Freyermuth et al., 2018).

The effectiveness of EbA measures, however, varies considerably 
depending on storm, wetland, reef and landscape parameters (Koch 
et al., 2009; Loder et al., 2009; Wamsley et al., 2010; Pinsky et al., 
2013; Quataert et al., 2015), which makes it difﬁcult to extrapolate 
the physical and economic beneﬁts across geographies. Depending 
on these parameters, rates of surge attenuation can vary between 
5–70 cm km–1 (Krauss et al., 2009; Vuik et al., 2015). 
Critical gaps remain in our understanding about those parameters 
that together affect the success of ecosystem-based measures 
including choice of species and restoration techniques, lead time, 
natural variability and residual risk, temperature, salinity, wave 
energy and tidal range (Smith, 2006; Stiles Jr, 2006). Among reasons 
commonly cited for the failure of mangrove restoration projects are 
poor choice of mangrove species, planting in the wrong tidal zones 
and in areas of excessive wave energy (Primavera and Esteban, 2008; 
Bayraktarov et al., 2016; Kodikara et al., 2017).
The effectiveness of ecosystem-based measures also exhibits high 
seasonal, annual and longer-term variability. For example, marsh 
and seagrass wetlands typically have lower densities in winter which 
reduces their coastal protection capacity (Möller and Spencer, 2002; 
Paul and Amos, 2011; Schoutens et al., 2019). In the long-term, there 
is limited evidence and low agreement on how changes in sea level, 
sediment inputs, ocean temperature and ocean acidity will inﬂuence 
the extent, distribution and health of marsh and mangrove wetlands, 
coral reefs and oyster reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007; Lovelock et al., 
2015; Crosby et al., 2016; Albert et al., 2017). EbA measures may have 
differential lead times before they are effective. For example, newly 
planted mangroves provide less wave attenuation until they mature 
(~3–5 years; Mazda et al., 1997). In contrast, a reef restoration project 
that uses submerged concrete structures performs as a breakwater as 
soon as the sub-structure is in place (Reguero et al., 2018a).
4.4.2.3.5 Co-beneﬁts and drawbacks  
of ecosystem-based adaptation 
There is high conﬁdence that ecosystem-based measures provide 
multiple co-beneﬁts such as sequestering carbon (Siikamäki et al., 
2012; Hamilton and Friess, 2018), income from tourism (Carr and 
Mendelsohn, 2003; Spalding et al., 2017), enhancing coastal ﬁshery 
productivity (Carrasquilla-Henao and Juanes, 2017; Taylor et al., 
2018), improving water quality (Coen et al., 2007; Lamb et al., 2017), 
providing raw material for food, medicine, fuel and construction 
(Hussain and Badola, 2010; Uddin et al., 2013), and a range of 
intangible and cultural beneﬁts (Scyphers et al., 2015) that help 
improve the resilience of communities vulnerable to sea level hazards 
(Sutton-Grier et al., 2015).
In comparison to hard structures like seawalls, EbA measures, 
particularly coastal wetlands, require more land (The Royal Society 
Science Policy Centre, 2014), and competition for land is often why the 
ecosystems have declined in the ﬁrst place (4.4.2.3.1). On developed 
coasts, this land is often not available. In such cases, hybrid measures 
that either combine EbA measures with structural measures like 
mangrove forests in front of dikes (Dasgupta et al., 2019), or build 
ecological enhancements into engineered structures can provide an 
effective solution. Like any other feature that interacts with coastal 
processes, natural wetlands and reefs can increase ﬂooding in some 
instances, for example, due to the redistribution or acceleration of 
ﬂows in channels within a wetland system (Marsooli et al., 2016), 
or an increase in infragravity wave (i.e., surface gravity waves with 
frequencies lower than wind waves) energy behind a reef (Roeber 
and Bricker, 2015).
4.4.2.3.6 Governance of ecosystem-based adaptation 
The coastal protection beneﬁts of natural ecosystems are increasingly 
being recognised within international discourse and national coastal 
adaptation, resilience and sustainable development plans and 
strategies (Section  4.4.2.3.1). In general, obtaining permits for EbA 
remains more difﬁcult compared to established hard protection 
measures, in places like the USA (Bilkovic, 2017). However, there are 
examples of instruments speciﬁcally tailored to retain the protective 
function of EbA (Borges et al., 2009; Government of India, 2018). The 
Living Shorelines Regulations of the state government of Maryland 
in the USA (Maryland DEP, 2013), for instance, requires that private 
properties must include marsh creation or other non-structural 
measures when stabilising their shorelines, unless a waiver is obtained.
There are an increasing number of public and private ﬁnancial 
mechanisms and policy instruments to encourage the use and 
implementation of EbA measures (Colgan et al., 2017; Sutton-Grier 
et al., 2018). For example, a regulation by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) of the USA, allows proponents of hazard 
mitigation projects, such as state, territorial and local governments, to 
take into account the co-beneﬁts of EbA when assessing beneﬁt-cost 
ratios of FEMA-funded recovery projects (FEMA, 2015). International 
guidelines are being developed for designing and implementing EbA 
measures, with the intention to support wider implementation of 
these responses (Hardaway Jr and Duhring, 2010; Van Slobbe et al., 
2013; Van Wesenbeeck et al., 2017; Bridges et al., 2018).
4.4.2.3.7 Economic efﬁciency of ecosystem-based adaptation 
There is limited evidence regarding the economic efﬁciency of 
EbA, mainly due to the low agreement about EbA effectiveness 
(Section 4.4.2.3.2) and costs (Section 4.4.2.3.2). A study of coastal 
protection measures on the Gulf of Mexico coastline, USA, estimated 
that EbA measures have average beneﬁt-cost ratios above 3.5 for 
2030 ﬂood risk conditions, assuming a discount rate of 2% (Reguero 
et al., 2018b; see Section 4.4.2.3.2). This study also ﬁnds that EbA are 
nearly four times more cost-efﬁcient along developed coastlines as 
compared to conservation-priority areas because protection beneﬁts 
are higher in the former case due to the level of asset exposure.
4.4.2.4 
Advance 
4.4.2.4.1 Observed advance across geographies
Advance has a long history in most areas where there are dense 
coastal populations and a shortage of land (very high conﬁdence). 
This includes land reclamation through polders around the southern 
North Sea (Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and England) and 
393
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4

China (Wang et al., 2014), which coincides with regions where 
there is extensive hard protection in place (Section 4.4.2.4). Land 
reclamation has also taken place in all major coastal cities to some 
degree, even if only for the creation of port and harbour areas by 
raising coastal ﬂats above normal tidal levels through sediment 
inﬁll. On some steep coasts, where there is little ﬂat land, such as the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, material from 
elevated areas has been excavated to create ﬁll material to build 
land out into the sea.
Globally, it is estimated that about 33,700 km2 of land has been 
gained from the sea during the last 30 years (about 50% more than 
has been lost), with the biggest gains being due to land reclamation 
in places like Dubai, Singapore and China (Wang et al., 2014; 
Donchyts et al., 2016). In Shanghai alone, 590 km2 land has been 
reclaimed during the same period (Sengupta et al., 2018). In Lagos, 
25 km² of new land is currently being reclaimed (www.ekoatlantic.
com). Land reclamation is also popular in some small island settings. 
The Maldives has recently increased the land area of their capital 
region by constructing a new island called Hulhumalé, which has 
been built 60 cm higher than the normal island elevation of 1.5 m, in 
order to take into account future SLR (Hinkel et al., 2018).
4.4.2.4.2 Projected advance
Advance was not primarily a response to SLR in the past, but due to 
a range of drivers, including land scarcity, population pressure and 
extreme events, future advance measures are expected to become 
more integrated with coastal adaptation and might even be seen 
as an opportunity to support and fund adaptation in some cases 
(Linham and Nicholls, 2010; RIBA and ICE, 2010; Nicholls, 2018). 
While there is no literature on this topic, signiﬁcant further advance 
measures can be expected in land scarce situations, such as found in 
China, Japan and Singapore, in coming decades.
4.4.2.4.3 Costs of advance
Contrary to protection measures, little systematic monetary 
information is available about costs of advance measures, speciﬁcally 
not in the peer reviewed literature. The costs of land reclamation are 
extremely variable and depend on the unit cost of ﬁll versus the 
volumetric requirement to raise the land. Hence, ﬁlling shallow areas 
is preferred on a cost basis.
4.4.2.4.4 Effectiveness of advance
Similar to hard protection, land reclamation is mature and effective 
technology and can provide predictable levels of safety. If the entire 
land area is raised above the height of ESLs, residual risks are lower 
as compared to hard protection as there is no risk of catastrophic 
defence failure. 
4.4.2.4.5 Co-beneﬁts and drawbacks of advance
The major co-beneﬁt of advance is the creation of new land. The 
major drawbacks include groundwater salinisation, enhanced 
erosion and loss of coastal ecosystems and habitat, and the growth 
of the coastal ﬂoodplain (Li et al., 2014; Nadzir et al., 2014; Wang 
et al., 2014; Chee et al., 2017). In China, for example, about 50% of 
coastal ecosystems have been lost due to land reclamation, leading 
to a range of impacts such as loss of biodiversity, decline of bird 
species and ﬁsheries resources, reduced water puriﬁcation, and more 
frequent harmful algal blooms (Wang et al., 2014). For example, the 
reclamation of about 29,000 ha of land in Saemangeum, Republic of 
Korea, in 2006, has led to a decrease in shorebird numbers by over 
30% in two years, probably caused by mortality (Moores et al., 2016). 
Inadvertently, historic land reclamation through polderisation may 
have enhanced exposure and risk to coastal ﬂooding by creating new 
populated ﬂoodplains, but this has not been evaluated.
4.4.2.4.6 Governance of advance
Land reclamation raises equity issues with regards to access 
and distribution of the new land created, speciﬁcally due to the 
political economy associated with high coastal land values, and 
the involvement of private capital and interests (Bisaro and Hinkel, 
2018), but this has hardly been explored in the literature.
4.4.2.4.7 Economic efﬁciency of advance
There is limited evidence on the efﬁciency of advance responses in 
the scientiﬁc literature. Beneﬁt-cost ratios of land reclamation can 
be very high in urban areas due to high land and real estate prices 
(Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018).
4.4.2.5 
Accommodation 
4.4.2.5.1 Observed accommodation across geographies
There is a high agreement that accommodation is a core element of 
adaptation, and it is taking place on various scales based on measures 
such as ﬂood prooﬁng and raising buildings, implementing drainage 
systems, land use changes as well as EWS, emergency planning, 
setback zones and insurance schemes. However, no literature is 
available that summarises observed accommodation worldwide. 
There is low evidence of accommodation occurring directly as a 
consequence of SLR but high evidence of accommodation measures 
being implemented in response to coastal hazards such as coastal 
ﬂooding, salinisation and other sea-borne hazards such as cyclones. 
Flood prooﬁng may include the use of building designs and materials 
which make structures less vulnerable to ﬂood damages and/or 
prevent ﬂoodwaters from entering structures. Examples include 
ﬂoating houses in Asia, such as in Vietnam (Trang, 2016), raising 
the ﬂoor of houses in the lower Niger delta (Musa et al., 2016), 
construction of verandas with sandbags and shelves in houses to 
elevate goods during ﬂoods in coastal communities in Cameroon 
(Munji et al., 2013). In Semarang City, Indonesia, residents adapted 
to coastal ﬂooding by elevation of their houses by 50–400 cm or by 
moving their goods to safer places, without making structural changes 
(Buchori et al., 2018). Residents of Can Tho City of the Mekong Delta, 
Vietnam elevated houses in response to tidal ﬂooding (Garschagen, 
2015). In urban areas extensive drainage systems contribute to 
accommodation such as in Hong Kong and Singapore, which rely on 
394
Chapter 4 
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities

urban drainage systems to handle large volumes of surface runoff 
generated during storm events (Chan et al., 2018). Farming practices 
have been adapted to frequent ﬂooding in the lower Niger delta: 
farmers raise crops above ﬂoodwaters by planting on mounds of soil 
and apply ridging and terracing on farmlands to form barriers (Musa 
et al., 2016). In the ﬂoodplains of Bangladesh, ﬂoating gardens help 
to maintain food production even if the area is submerged (Irfanullah 
et al., 2011). Here, the traditional way to build homesteads is on a 
raised mound, built with earth from the excavation of canals and 
ponds (ADPC, 2005). Coastal infrastructure, such as ports, having a 
functional need to be at the coast, accommodate SLR with elevated 
piers and critical infrastructure. One example is Los Angeles, where 
PierS was raised to an elevation of 6 m (Aerts, 2018).
Communities in the Netherlands are experimenting with ﬂoating/
amphibious houses capable of adapting to different water levels, 
and similar considerations are also discussed in other geographies, 
such as in Bangkok (Nilubon et al., 2016). Flood prooﬁng is widely 
applied in the USA, where wet and dry ﬂood prooﬁng measures 
are recognised: wet ﬂood prooﬁng reduces damage from ﬂooding 
while dry ﬂood prooﬁng makes a building watertight or substantially 
impermeable to ﬂoodwaters up to the expected ﬂood height (FEMA, 
2014). In that sense, dry ﬂood prooﬁng could also be interpreted as a 
protection measure on the level of individual structures.
Physical accommodation to salinisation and saline water intrusion 
is more poorly documented. It mainly entails agricultural adaptation 
to soil salinity, and saline surface and ground water, as described for 
the land use changes aimed at alternating rice-shrimp systems and 
shrimp aquaculture in the Mekong Delta (Renaud et al., 2015) or using 
methods which decrease soil salinity, such as ﬂushing rice ﬁelds with 
fresh water to wash out salinity (Renaud et al., 2015), or applying 
maize straw in wheat ﬁelds (Xie et al., 2017). Coastal communities 
are also experimenting with the use of salt tolerant varieties as a 
result of breeding programmes, for example, in Indonesia (Rumanti 
et al., 2018), or saline irrigation water in conjunction with fresh 
water, such as for maize in coastal Bangladesh (Murad et al., 2018). 
Adaptation planning for SLR has been incorporated into land use 
planning in several states in the USA (Butler et al., 2016b). In the 
Yangtze River Delta, landscape planning designs ﬂoodplain zones to 
accept ﬂoodwaters (Seavitt, 2013). In the Mekong Delta, different 
land use options, including shifting from freshwater agriculture to 
brackish and saline agriculture, were proposed as seawater intrudes 
farther inland (Smajgl et al., 2015).
EWS are frequently incorporated into overall risk reduction strategies 
and are applied for various coastal hazards such as tsunamis in coastal 
areas of Indonesia (Lauterjung et al., 2017) and hydro-meteorological 
coastal hazards in Bangladesh and Uruguay (Leal Filho et al., 2018). 
They fall under ‘accommodation’ as they allow people to remain in 
the hazard-prone area but provide advance warning or evacuation 
in the face of imminent danger. In contrast to hard protection 
measures, EWS have shorter installation time and lower impact on 
the environment (Sättele et al., 2015). They can work effectively to 
reduce risk arising from predictable hazardous events but are less 
well-suited to accommodate slow onset change (i.e.,  events or 
processes that happen with high certainty under different climate 
change scenarios). 
Climate risk insurance schemes have been recently developed to 
address sudden, and in rare cases, slow onset hazards at the coast, 
and to increase overall resilience. For coastal risks, insurance is 
mainly applicable for sudden onset hazards, including storm surges 
and coastal ﬂooding, to buffer against the ﬁnancial impacts of 
loss events. For slow onset hazards, insurance schemes are not the 
ﬁrst-best tool, whereas resilience building and prevention of loss 
and damage in such instances may be more cost-effective ways 
to address these risks (Warner et al., 2013). In this context, index 
based insurance products are increasingly offered, particularly in 
low-income countries and have also been included in a number 
of countries in their NDCs and in some cases in their National 
Adaptation Plans (NAPs; Kreft et al., 2017). Countries with existing 
climate risk insurance schemes include, for example, Haiti, Maldives, 
Seychelles and Vietnam. The InsuResilience Global Partnership for 
Climate and Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance Solutions was 
launched at the 2017 UN Climate Conference (COP 23) in Bonn. 
InsuResilience aims to enable more timely response after a disaster 
and helps to better prepare for climate and disaster risk through 
the use of climate and disaster risk ﬁnance and insurance solutions. 
So far, climate risk insurance was used mainly in the context of 
agriculture, where it has showed great efﬁcacy in boosting 
investments for increasing productivity (Fernandez and Schäfer, 
2018). However, on the global scale, the uptake of index insurance 
is still low (Yuzva et al., 2018). 
4.4.2.5.2 Projected accommodation
While there is no literature on projected accommodation, current 
trends suggest further uptake of accommodation approaches in 
coming decades, especially where protection approaches are not 
economically viable. Flood prooﬁng of houses and establishment 
of new building codes to accommodate coastal hazards is also 
expected to become more common in coming decades. Similarly, 
accommodation measures for salinity are under further development, 
such as rice breeding programs to improve salt tolerance (Linh et al., 
2012; Quan et al., 2018b). However, the achievements to improve 
salinity tolerance in rice are rather modest so far (Hoang et al., 2016) 
although efforts are expected to continue or even intensify. Given 
that index based insurance products have been included in NDCs and 
NAPs in a number of countries (Kreft et al., 2017), uptake is expected 
to grow. Ports can continue elevating hazard-prone facilities and 
the critical parts of port infrastructure can be protected by ﬂood 
walls. Alternatively, ports can use advance measures to develop port 
facilities seaward (Aerts, 2018).
In summary, due to the large variety of different measures 
implemented in ad hoc ways worldwide, there is low conﬁdence in 
quantitative projections of accommodation measures in response to 
SLR. However, there is high conﬁdence that accommodation measures 
will continue to be a widespread adaptation option especially in 
combination with protection and retreat measures.

4.4.2.5.3 Cost of accommodation
The cost of accommodation varies widely with the measures taken as 
well as the expected ﬂood height. For ﬂood prooﬁng of buildings in 
New York City for instance, Aerts et al. (2014) provided an economic 
rationale for the implementation of improved building codes, such as 
elevating new buildings and protecting critical infrastructure (see also 
Box 4.1). Flood prooﬁng can also be undertaken by individuals and 
even small, inexpensive ﬂood prooﬁng efforts can result in reductions 
in ﬂood damage (Zhu et al., 2010). In general, costs for ﬂood prooﬁng 
increase as the ﬂood protection elevation increases. Other costs 
include those for maintenance and, if applicable, insurance premiums. 
For example, deciding to elevate a building in the USA will increase 
the project’s cost; however, the additional elevation may lead to 
signiﬁcant savings on ﬂood insurance premiums (FEMA, 2014).
4.4.2.5.4 Effectiveness of accommodation
Accommodation measures can be very effective for current 
conditions and small amounts of SLR, also buying time to prepare 
for future SLR. Success stories include the case of Bangladesh 
where improved early warnings, the construction of shelters, and 
development of evacuation plans, helped to reduce fatalities as a 
result of ﬂooding and cyclones (Haque et al., 2012). Illiteracy, lack 
of awareness and poor communication are, however, still hampering 
the effectiveness of early warnings (Haque et al., 2012). If well 
designed, and if the premiums reﬂect individual risks, insurance can 
effectively discourage further investments in risky areas as insurance 
cost provides information on the nature of locality-speciﬁc risks and 
can incentivise investment in risk reduction by requiring that certain 
minimum standards are met before granting insurance coverage 
(Kunreuther, 2015). Limits to such accommodation occur much earlier 
compared to protect, advance and retreat measures. While dikes 
can be raised to 10 m, and retreat can be implemented to the 10 m 
contour or higher, accommodating SLR has practical and economic 
limits, and ultimately retreat or protection will be required.
4.4.2.5.5 Co-beneﬁts and drawbacks of accommodation
The major co-beneﬁt of accommodation is improved resilience of in 
situ communities without retreat or the use of land and resources for 
the construction of protection measures. Flood prooﬁng, for example, 
helps prevent demolition or relocation of structures and it is often 
an affordable and cost effective approach to reducing ﬂood risk 
(Zhu et al., 2010). Speciﬁc accommodation measures have different 
co-beneﬁts such as that stilt houses not only protect from ﬂooding 
but also from wild animals (Biswas et al., 2015). Accommodation – 
depending on the measure implemented  – has the potential to 
maintain landscape connectivity allowing access to the ocean as well 
as landward migration of ecosystems, at least to some degree. It also 
retains ﬂood dynamics and with that the beneﬁts of ﬂooding such as 
sediment re-distribution. Stilt houses leave space for the ﬂoodwater 
while wet-ﬂood prooﬁng maintains a low hydrostatic pressure on the 
buildings so that structures are less prone to failure during ﬂooding 
(FEMA, 2014).
The major drawback of accommodation is that it actually does not 
prevent ﬂooding or salinisation, which might have consequences not 
addressed by the accommodation measure itself. Examples include 
inundation of an area where houses are ﬂood proofed but schooling 
of children and business operations are nevertheless disrupted. 
Signiﬁcant clean up may also be needed after ﬂood water enters 
buildings, including the removal of sediment, debris or chemical 
residues (FEMA, 2014). Also, ﬂood prooﬁng measures require the 
current risk of ﬂooding to be known and communicated to and 
understood by the public through ﬂood hazard mapping studies and 
ﬂood warning information (Zhu et al., 2010). Small businesses in 
particular may face difﬁculties to recover from ﬂooding due to lack of 
forward planning (Hoggart et al., 2014).
Co-beneﬁts of insurance include the possibility that sovereign level 
insurance may improve the credit ratings of vulnerable countries, 
reducing the cost of capital and allowing them to borrow to invest in 
resilient infrastructure (Buhr et al., 2018). Major natural disasters can 
weaken sovereign ratings, especially if there is no insurance in place 
(Moritz Kramer, 2015). One much discussed drawback of insurance is 
the moral hazard that may result: since someone else bears the costs 
of a loss, those insured may be less inclined to take precautionary 
measures or may act recklessly (Duus-Otterström and Jagers, 2011).
4.4.2.5.6 Governance of accommodation
While accommodation measures to coastal hazards are often taking 
place at the local level, and are decided by individual homeowners, 
farmers or communities, from a governance perspective it is important 
to provide guidance on how and to what extent owners can retroﬁt 
their homes to reduce the risk to coastal ﬂooding. In New York City, 
for instance, changes to building codes, require elevating, or ﬂood 
prooﬁng of existing and new buildings in the 100-year ﬂoodplain, 
and prevent construction of critical infrastructure like hospitals in the 
ﬂood zone (NYC, 2014; see also Box 4.1).
Effective coastal risk management efforts rely on good governance 
that includes understanding the probability and consequences of 
hazard impacts like ﬂooding and salinisation, and implementing 
mechanisms to prevent or manage all possible events (EEA, 2013). 
The effectiveness of accommodation measures based on institutional 
measures, such as EWS and evacuation plans, largely depends on the 
governance capabilities they are embedded in. 
4.4.2.5.7 Economic-efﬁciency of accommodation
There is high conﬁdence that many accommodation measures are 
very cost-efﬁcient. Flood EWS coupled with precautionary measures 
have been shown to produce signiﬁcant economic beneﬁts (Parker, 
2017). Elevating areas at high risk and retroﬁtting buildings in Ho Chi 
Minh City, for example, have beneﬁt-cost ratios of 15 under SLR of 
180 cm and a discount rate of 5% during the 21st century (Scussolini 
et al., 2017). In the context of the National Flood Insurance Program 
in the USA, it has been estimated that elevating new houses by 
60 cm might raise mortgage payments by 240 USD yr–1, but reduce 
ﬂood insurance by 1000–2000 USD yr–1 depending on the ﬂood 
zone (FEMA, 2018), although this only addresses present extremes 
396

4
and ignores future SLR (Zhu et al., 2010). In Europe, the beneﬁts of 
installing a cross-border continental-scale ﬂood EWS are estimated 
at 400 EUR per EUR invested (Pappenberger et al., 2015).
4.4.2.6 
Retreat 
4.4.2.6.1 Observed retreat across geographies
There is limited evidence of migration occurring directly as a 
consequence of impacts associated with environmental change 
generally and SLR speciﬁcally. Research examining the linkages 
between migration and environmental change has been conducted 
in the Paciﬁc (Connell, 2012; Janif et al., 2016; Perumal, 2018), South 
Asia (Szabo et al., 2016; Call et al., 2017; Stojanov et al., 2017), Latin 
America (Nawrotzki and DeWaard, 2016; Nawrotzki et al., 2017), 
Alaska, in North America (Marino and Lazrus, 2015; Hamilton et al., 
2016) and Africa (Gray and Wise, 2016). While some limited evidence 
was found on population movement inland associated with shoreline 
encroachment in Louisiana, USA (Hauer et al., 2018), this research 
emphasises that the relationship between climate change impacts 
including SLR and migration is more nuanced than suggested by 
simpliﬁed cause-and-effect models (Adger et al., 2015). Migration 
is driven by a large number of individual, social, economic, political, 
demographic and environmental push and pull factors (Black et al., 
2011; Koubi et al., 2016), interwoven with mega-trends such as 
urbanisation, land use change and globalisation, and is inﬂuenced by 
development and political practices and discourses (Bettini and Gioli, 
2016; Cross-Chapter Box 7). For example, asset endowed individuals 
and households are more able to migrate out from ﬂood-prone 
areas (Milan and Ruano, 2014; Logan et al., 2016), while the poorest 
households are signiﬁcantly susceptible to material and human losses 
following an extreme event or disruptive environmental change 
(Call et al., 2017). Individual and social drivers include perceptions 
of environmental change (Koubi et al., 2016), formed by both direct 
experience of change and indirect information from social networks, 
mass media and governmental agencies. Environmental factors 
include the longer term impacts of climate variability and change, 
which can erode the capacity of ecosystems to provide essential 
services such as availability of freshwater, soil fertility and energy 
production acting as a threat multiplier for other drivers of migration 
(Hunter et al., 2015; McLeman, 2018).
There is robust evidence of disasters displacing people worldwide, 
but limited evidence that climate change or SLR is the direct cause. 
In 2017, 18.8 million people were displaced by disasters, of which 
18  million were displaced by weather-related events including 
8.6  million people displaced by ﬂoods and 7.5  million by storms, 
with hundreds of millions more at risk (IDMC, 2017; Islam and Khan, 
2018). The majority of resultant population movements tend to occur 
within the borders of affected countries (Warner and Aﬁﬁ, 2014; 
Hunter et al., 2015; Nawrotzki et al., 2017). 
We ﬁnd robust evidence of planned relocation taking place worldwide 
in low-lying zones exposed to the impacts of coastal hazards (Hino 
et al., 2017; Mortreux et al., 2018). While relocation plans are usually 
discussed after an extreme event occurs, they generally target the 
reduction of long-term environmental risks, including those of 
SLR (McAdam and Ferris, 2015; Hino et al., 2017; Morrison, 2017). 
For example, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana 
Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast recommended 
the relocation of several communities in the next 50 years due to 
expected RSL rise, and relocation of inhabitants from Isle de Jean 
Charles is already taking place (Barbier, 2015; Coastal Protection 
and Restoration Authority of Louisiana, 2017). In Shismaref, an 
Iñupiat community in Alaska, increased shoreline erosion triggered 
government-led relocation (Bronen and Chapin, 2013; Maldonado 
et al., 2013). In the Paciﬁc, current coastal risks aggravated by rising sea 
level are driving the government led relocation of the inhabitants of 
Taro, the provincial capital of Choiseul Province in the Solomon Islands 
(Albert et al., 2018). In 2014, the government of Kiribati purchased 
land on Vanua Levu, the second largest island of Fiji, with the purpose 
of economic development and food security, but many i-Kiribati 
associated the acquisition with future relocation to Fiji (Hermann and 
Kempf, 2017). In southeast Asia, the government of Vietnam assists 
and manages rural populations’ relocation from disaster prone areas 
exposed to coastal risks in the Mekong Delta to large industrial 
areas with high labour demand, such as Ho Chi Minh City and Can 
Tho City (Collins et al., 2017). Managed realignment carried out for 
the purposes of habitat creation, improved ﬂood risk management 
and more affordable coastal protection, is increasingly popular in 
Europe, but usually involves small-scale projects and few people if any 
(Esteves, 2013). Most of the managed realignment projects in the UK 
and Germany have been carried out for habitat creation and to reduce 
spending on coastal defences (Hino et al., 2017). 
4.4.2.6.2 Projected retreat
There is high agreement that climate change has the potential to 
drastically alter the size and direction of migration ﬂows (Connell, 
2012; Gray and Wise, 2016; Janif et al., 2016; Nawrotzki and DeWaard, 
2016; Szabo et al., 2016; Call et al., 2017; Nawrotzki et al., 2017), but 
there is low conﬁdence in quantitative projections of migration in 
response to SLR and extremes of sea level. The number of modelling 
studies of migration in response to environmental drivers has 
increased rapidly over the past decade (Kumari et al. 2018), but only 
a small portion of these model studies address migration in response 
to SLR and sea level extremes. Amongst these, a variety of different 
modelling approaches have been applied, but no model currently 
accounts for all push and pull factors inﬂuencing migration decisions 
(see Section 4.4.2.6.1).
A model projecting future US county-level populations exposed 
to permanent inundation was combined with an empirical model 
of potential migration destinations to produce the ﬁrst sea level/
migration analysis of migrant destinations (Hauer, 2017). Assuming 
that households with incomes above 100,000 USD yr–1 would have 
resources to stay and adapt, it was found that 1.8 m SLR by 2100 
would displace over two million people in south Florida. Projected 
population gains due to SLR reach several hundred thousand for 
some inland urban areas. A gravity model modiﬁed to account for 
both distance to destinations and their attractiveness (deriving from 
such factors as economic opportunity and environmental amenities) 
projects a net migration into and out of the East African coastal 
zone, ranging from out-migration of 750,000 people between 2020 
397
Sea Level Rise and Implications for Low-Lying Islands, Coasts and Communities 
Chapter 4
4
and 2050 to a small in-migration (Kumari et al., 2018). However, 
this range includes migration stimulated by freshwater availability 
as well as SLR and episodic ﬂooding. A generalised radiation or 
diffusion model predicts 0.9 million people will migrate due to SLR 
in Bangladesh by 2050 and 2.1 million by 2100, largely internally, 
with substantial implications for nutrition, shelter and employment 
in destination areas (Davis et al., 2018).
A global dynamic general equilibrium framework (Desmet et al., 2018) 
provides a more comprehensive approach to accounting for economic 
factors including changes to trade, innovation, and agglomeration, 
and political factors, such as policy barriers to mobility, all of 
which inﬂuence the migration response to environmental change. 
Agent-based models attempt to simulate decisions by individuals who 
face a variety of socioeconomic and environmental changes (Kniveton 
et al., 2012). However, neither general equilibrium nor agent-based 
frameworks have been applied yet to migration responses to SLR. 
Econometric models, common in climate/migration studies (Millock, 
2015), likewise have yet to be applied to the SLR context, except for a 
single case study where an econometric model was used to interpret 
the outcome of a discrete choice experiment (Buchanan et al., 2019). 
For example, an interesting distinction between migration responses 
to long term temperature and precipitation trends in contrast to 
extreme events like ﬂooding has been noted (Bohra-Mishra et al., 
2014; Mueller et al., 2014), but similar econometric studies have yet 
to be done comparing responses to gradual land loss versus ﬂooding 
during ESL events.
4.4.2.6.3 Cost of retreat 
We have limited evidence of estimates on the cost of retreat. There 
are few cost estimates in the literature and these are based on 
stylised assumptions as little empirical data is available. 
The cost of managed relocation, including land acquisition, building of 
roads and infrastructure and other subsidies, was found to vary from 
10,000–270,000 GBP per home in United Kingdom Coastal Change 
Pathﬁnder projects (Regeneris Consulting, 2011), and between 
10,000 USD in Fiji and 100,000 USD per person in Alaska and in the Isle 
of Jean Charles in the USA (Hino et al., 2017). For people involved in 
planned relocation in Shaanxi Province, Northwest China, households 
receive subsidies ranging from 1200–5100 USD (Lei et al., 2017). 
The Louisiana’s National Disaster Resilience Competition, Phase II 
Application states that the proposed relocation of 40 households in the 
Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana is estimated to cost 48,379,249 USD, 
including the cost for land acquisition, infrastructure and construction 
of new dwellings (State of Louisiana, 2015). Generally, maintenance 
costs do not arise if people are moved completely out of the hazard 
zone (Suppasri et al., 2015; Hino et al., 2017). In cases in which people 
are only moved so that short-term but not long-term risk is reduced, 
follow up costs for further responses will occur.
The individual costs associated with displacement after an 
environmental disaster are difﬁcult to obtain. In the literature, there 
are limited estimates of the social costs to residents of Guadeloupe, 
Saint Croix, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico, and the southeast USA displaced 
after Hurricanes Hugo (1989) and Katrina (2005). A survey conducted 
across 18 parishes (i.e. counties) in Louisiana in 2006 revealed 
that non-displaced households had an average income of 36,000 
USD compared to an average income of 30,000 USD recorded for 
displaced households (Hori and Schafer, 2010). 
4.4.2.6.4 Effectiveness of retreat 
There is very high conﬁdence that retreat is effective in reducing 
the risks and impacts of SLR as retreat directly reduces exposure of 
human settlements and activities (Gioli et al., 2016; Shayegh et al., 
2016; Hauer, 2017; Morrison, 2017). 
4.4.2.6.5 Co-beneﬁts and drawbacks of retreat
The other outcomes of retreat responses, beyond the one of 
effectively reducing SLR risks and impacts, are complex and affect 
both origin and destination. Generally, retreat impacts social 
networks, access to services and economic and social opportunities, 
and several well-being indicators (Jones and Clark, 2014; Adams, 
2016; Herath et al., 2017; Kura et al., 2017; McNamara et al., 
2018). The socioeconomic beneﬁts of migration to individuals and 
households may include improved access to health and education 
services, as well as labour markets (Wrathall and Suckall, 2016). 
Destination areas may gain economically as populations and 
capital relocate and provide a new source of labour, capital and 
innovation to inland areas (see Section 4.4.2.6.2; de Haas, 2010). 
Income inequality may be reduced, but only through migration to 
areas with growing economies. Remittances can provide ﬂexibility 
in livelihood options, supply capital for investment and spread risk 
(Scheffran et al., 2012). 
Drawbacks of migration and displacement at the destination can 
be increased competition for resources and within labour markets, 
pressure on frontline services and on social cohesion as a result of 
heightened cultural or ethnic tension (Werz and Hoffman, 2015), as 
well as cultural, social and psychological losses related to disruptions 
to sense of place and identity, self-efﬁcacy, and rights to ancestral 
land and culture (McNamara et al., 2018). The unplanned and 
unassisted voluntary relocation of the inhabitants of Nuatambu and 
Nusa Hope in the Solomon Islands to areas further from the coast 
poses a series of practical challenges with sanitation, access to 
drinking water and transport (Albert et al., 2018). 
The success of planned relocation in terms of the balance of 
co-beneﬁts and drawbacks varies across relocation schemes (Hino 
et al., 2017) and outcomes are highly uneven (Genovese and 
Przyluski, 2013; Ford et al., 2015; Nordstrom et al., 2015; Bukvic 
and Owen, 2017; Hino et al., 2017; Jamero et al., 2017). On the one 
hand, well designed and carefully implemented programmes, such 
as the ongoing resettlement of indigenous communities in Alaska, 
can improve housing standards and reduce vulnerability (Suppasri 
et al., 2015; Albert et al., 2018). On the other hand, relocated 
communities have often become further impoverished (Wilmsen and 
Webber, 2015), because they are removed from cultural and material 
resources on which they rely, compounded by poor implementation 
processes that may fail to ensure fairness, social and environmental

justice and well-being (Herath et al., 2017; Mortreux et al., 2018; 
Nygren and Wayessa, 2018).
4.4.2.6.6 Governance of retreat 
Environmentally driven migration and displacement gained major 
attention over the last decade in the international policy community 
(Goodwin-Gill and McAdam, 2017). Worldwide programmes, such 
as the Nansen Initiative, signed by 110 countries to address the 
serious legal gap around the protection of cross-border migrants 
impacted by natural disasters, have been implemented (Gemenne 
and Brücker, 2015). In 2016, the Platform on Disaster Displacement 
was established to follow up on the work conducted by the Nansen 
Initiative with the objective of implementing the recommendations 
of the Protection Agenda (McAdam and Ferris, 2015). Governments 
are further encouraged by civil society to relocate people at risk and 
displaced populations out of disaster-prone areas to avoid potential 
casualties (Lei et al., 2017; Mortreux et al., 2018). There have been 
discussions among Paciﬁc Island countries and territories and other 
nations in the Paciﬁc Rim around new policy mechanisms that would 
facilitate adaptive migration in the region in response to natural 
hazards including SLR (Burson and Bedford, 2015). There have been 
cases presented at the Immigration and Protection Tribunal of New 
Zealand testing refugee claims associated with climate change from 
Tuvaluan and i-Kiribati applicants, both citing environmental change 
on their home islands as grounds for remaining in New Zealand. 
One applicant was successful in the quest to remain in New Zealand 
on humanitarian grounds, but not on the grounds of refugee status 
(Farbotko et al., 2016).
The is high agreement that outcomes can be improved by upholding 
the principle of procedural justice and respecting the autonomy of 
individuals and their decisions about where and how they live (Warner 
et al., 2013; Schade et al., 2015; McNamara et al., 2018). However, 
there are cases where logistical and political stances constrain the 
application of such approach, such as when the government of Sri 
Lanka prohibited rebuilding along the coastline of the country after 
the 2004 tsunami (Hino et al., 2017). Proactive planning, including 
participation and consultation with those in peril, has the potential 
to improve outcomes (medium conﬁdence; de Sherbinin et al., 2011; 
Gemenne and Blocher, 2017). Governments can assist migrants 
through policy reforms to enable relocation to fast growing economic 
regions in the country. An example of this approach was adopted in 
Vietnam by both the National Target Program to Respond to Climate 
Change and the National Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, 
Response and Mitigation targeted at locations within the Mekong 
Delta exposed to the impacts of SLR (Nguyen et al., 2015; Collins 
et al., 2017). Outcomes of retreat for both community of origin and 
destination can also be improved by building the human capital of 
migrants (skills, health and education), reducing costs of migration 
and remittance transfer, and provision of improved safety nets for 
migrants at their destinations (high agreement) (Gemenne and 
Blocher, 2017).
4.4.2.6.7 Economic efﬁciency of retreat
There is limited evidence on the efﬁciency of retreat responses in the 
scientiﬁc literature.
4.4.3 
Governance Challenges in Responding  
to Sea Level Rise 
4.4.3.1 
Introduction
Governance is pivotal to shaping SLR responses. The assessment of 
SLR responses above has shown that each type of response raises 
speciﬁc governance challenges associated with the distribution 
of costs, beneﬁts and negative consequences of responses across 
societal actors. Hence, SLR responses require governance efforts if 
social conﬂicts are to be resolved and mutual opportunities amongst 
all actors realised. Generally, responses involve the interaction of 
diverse public and private actors at different levels of decision making 
with divergent values, interests and goals on coastal activities, 
lifestyles, livelihoods, risks, resilience and sustainability (high 
conﬁdence; Dovers and Hezri, 2010; Foerster et al., 2015; Giddens, 
2015; Mills et al., 2016; Dolšak and Prakash, 2018; Hinkel et al., 
2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; AR5). This leads to a number of 
overarching governance challenges that arise from the nature of SLR, 
which will be assessed in this section. 
While there is a substantial literature on coastal governance, little 
attention has been focused explicitly on SLR governance, as was 
also the case in AR5 (Wong et al., 2014). Furthermore, much of the 
adaptation governance literature has focused on putting forward 
normative prescriptions on how governance arrangements ought 
to be (e.g.,  transformative governance; Chafﬁn et al., 2016), but 
with limited empirical evidence on the actual effectiveness of these 
prescriptions (Klostermann et al., 2018; Runhaar et al., 2018). Hence, 
understanding the social mechanisms leading to the emergence 
of particular governance arrangements, and how effective they 
are in addressing climate change and SLR, is limited (Wong et al., 
2014; Bisaro and Hinkel, 2016; Oberlack, 2017; Bisaro et al., 2018; 
Roggero et al., 2018a; Roggero et al., 2018b). An important post-AR5 
development has thus been to move beyond descriptions and 
normative prescriptions about ‘good governance’ to explore which 
factors help (called enablers) or hinder (called barriers) how social 
choices are made and implemented on complex issues like climate 
change and SLR, as elaborated in the next subsection. 
4.4.3.2 
Understanding Barriers to Adaptation  
as Governance Challenges
AR5 stated that there are many reasons why adaptation governance 
is complex (Klein et al., 2014). The ﬁrst generation of studies that 
investigated this question empirically identiﬁed many (lists of) 
barriers that people have experienced in adaptation governance 
in speciﬁc case contexts, including political, institutional, 
social-cognitive, economic, ﬁnancial, biophysical and technical 
barriers (Klein et al., 2014). Although insightful for these speciﬁc 
cases, including SLR (Hinkel et al., 2018), accumulation of empirical 
399

ﬁndings in building theory proved to be limited, and it did not result 
in more evidence-informed advice to policy makers on how to deal 
with barriers (Biesbroek et al., 2013; Eisenack et al., 2014).
In response, in a second generation of studies, several frameworks 
have been proposed and tested to advance scholarship on barriers 
to adaptation (Eisenack and Stecker, 2012; Barnett et al., 2015; 
Lehmann et al., 2015; Bisaro and Hinkel, 2016). A frequently used 
framework was developed by Moser and Ekstrom (2010) who 
identiﬁed and linked key barriers to certain stages of the policy 
process: understanding, planning and management stages. Moser 
and Ekstrom (2010) argue that conditions, such as the scope and 
scale of adaptation, have signiﬁcant implications for which barriers 
are activated in the policy process, and how persistent and difﬁcult 
they are to overcome. This and other frameworks have been applied 
in a diversity of contexts, providing valuable insights about the 
governance challenges involved in adapting to climate change and 
suggestions for improvement (Ekstrom and Moser, 2014; Rosendo 
et al., 2018; Thaler et al., 2019).
A recent generation of studies takes more theory based approaches 
and includes contextual factors to analyse the key social mechanisms 
that explain why adaptation processes are often complex, result in 
deadlocks, delays or even failure (Biesbroek et al., 2014; Eisenack 
et al., 2014; Wellstead et al., 2014; Biesbroek et al., 2015; Bisaro 
and Hinkel, 2016; Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018; Sieber et al., 2018; 
Wellstead et al.). Such insights are critical as they can be used by 
practitioners for policy design (e.g.,  to prevent certain deadlocks 
from emerging by (re)designing contextual conditions), or provide 
insights on strategic interventions in ongoing processes to revitalise 
deadlocked adaptation governance (Biesbroek et al., 2017).
4.4.3.3 
Governance Challenges in the Face of Sea Level Rise
There is a wide diversity of governance challenges and opportunities 
for tackling SLR, with marked differences within and between coastal 
communities in developed and developing counties. Five salient 
overarching governance challenges that arise due to distinctive 
features of SLR were highlighted. This typology is then used to assess 
how planning, participation and conﬂict resolution (Section 4.4.4.2), 
decision analysis methods (Section 4.4.4.3), and enabling conditions 
(Section 4.5) can help to address these ﬁve challenges.
Time horizon and uncertainty: The long-term commitment to 
SLR (Section  4.2.3.5) and the large and deep uncertainty about 
the magnitude and timing of SLR beyond 2050 (Section 4.4.4.3.2), 
challenge standard planning and decision making practises for 
several reasons (high conﬁdence; Peters et al., 2017; Pot et al., 2018; 
Hall et al., 2019; Hinkel et al., 2019). The time horizon of SLR extends 
beyond usual political, electoral and budget cycles. Furthermore, 
many planning and decision making practices strive for predictability 
and certainty, which is at odds with the dynamic risk and deep 
uncertainty characterising SLR (Hall et al., 2019). Tensions can arise 
between established risk-based planning that seeks to measure risk, 
and adaptation responses that embrace uncertainty and complexity 
(Kuklicke and Demeritt, 2016; Carlsson Kanyama et al., 2019). For 
example, tensions arise because of the mismatch between the 
relative inﬂexibility of existing law and institutions and the evolving 
nature of SLR risk and impacts (Cosens et al., 2017; Craig et al., 
2017; DeCaro et al., 2017). Possible limits of in situ responses to 
ongoing SLR (e.g.,  protection and accommodation), bring into 
question prevailing legal approaches to property rights and land use 
regulation (Byrne, 2012). In addition, because uncertainty about SLR 
makes it difﬁcult to decide when to wait and when to act, public 
actors fear being held accountable for misjudgments (Kuklicke and 
Demeritt, 2016). The long time horizon and uncertainty of SLR make it 
difﬁcult to mobilise political will and the leadership required to take 
visionary action (Cuevas et al., 2016; Gibbs, 2016; Yusuf et al., 2016; 
Yusuf et al., 2018b).
Cross-scale and cross-domain coordination: SLR creates new 
coordination problems across jurisdictional levels and domains, 
because impacts cut across scales, sectors and policy domains and 
responding often exceeds the capacities of local governments and 
communities (medium conﬁdence; Araos et al., 2017; Termeer et al., 
2017; Pinto et al., 2018; Clar, 2019; Clar and Steurer, 2019; Sections 
4.3.2 and 4.4.2). Local responses are generally nested within a 
hierarchy of local, regional, national and international governance 
arrangements and cut across sectors (Cuevas, 2018; Chhetri 
et al., 2019; Clar, 2019). Furthermore responding to SLR is only one 
administrative priority amongst many, and the choice of SLR response 
is inﬂuenced by multiple co-existing functional responsibilities 
and perspectives (e.g.,  planning, emergency management, asset 
management and community development) that compete for 
legitimacy, further complicating the coordination challenge (Klein 
et al., 2016; Vij et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2019).
Equity and social vulnerability: SLR and responses may affect 
communities and society in ways that are not evenly distributed, 
which can compound vulnerability and inequity, and undermine 
societal aspirations, such as achieving SDGs (high conﬁdence; 
Section 4.3.3.2; Eriksen et al., 2015; Foerster et al., 2015; Sovacool 
et al., 2015; Clark et al., 2016; Gorddard et al., 2016; Adger et al., 
2017; Holland, 2017; Dolšak and Prakash, 2018; Lidström, 2018; 
Matin et al., 2018; Paprocki and Huq, 2018; Sovacool, 2018; Warner 
et al., 2018a). Costs and beneﬁts of action and inaction are distributed 
unevenly, with some coastal nations, particularly small island states, 
being confronted with adaptation costs amounting to several percent 
of GDP in the 21st century (Section 4.3.3.2). Land use planning for 
climate adaptation can exacerbate sociospatial inequalities at the 
local level, as illustrated in a study of eight cities, namely Boston 
(USA), New Orleans (USA), Medellin (Colombia), Santiago (Chile), 
Metro Manila (Philippines), Jakarta (Indonesia), Surat (India), and 
Dhaka (Bangladesh; Anguelovski et al., 2016). Private responses may 
also exacerbate inequalities as, for example, in Miami, USA, where 
purchase of homes in areas at higher elevation has increased property 
prices displacing poorer communities from these areas (Keenan et al., 
2018). In Bangladesh, some adaptation practices have enabled land 
capture by elites, public servants, the military and roving gangs, 
and resulted in various forms of marginalisation that compound 
vulnerability and risk (Sovacool, 2018); a reality also faced by many 
other coastal communities around the world (Sovacool et al., 2015).

Social conﬂict: Ongoing SLR could become a catalyst for possibly 
intractable social conﬂict by impacting human activities, infrastructure 
and development along low-lying shorelines (high conﬁdence). Social 
conﬂict refers here to the non-violent struggle between groups, 
organisations and communities over values, interests, resources, 
and inﬂuence or power, whereby parties seek to achieve their own 
goals, and may seek to prevent others from realising their goals and 
possibly harm rivals (Coser, 1967; Oberschall, 1978; Pruitt et al., 2003). 
SLR impacts that could contribute to conﬂict include: disruptions to 
critical infrastructure, cultural ties to the coast, livelihoods, coastal 
economies, public health, well-being, security, identity and the 
sovereignty of some low-lying island nations  (Sections 4.3.2.4, 
4.3.3.2, 4.3.3.6; Mills et al., 2016; Yusuf et al., 2016; Nursey-Bray, 
2017; Hinkel et al., 2018). SLR responses inevitably raise difﬁcult 
trade-offs between private and public interests, short- and long-term 
concerns, and security and conservation goals, which are difﬁcult to 
reconcile due to divergent problem framing, interests, values and 
ethical positions (Eriksen et al., 2015; Foerster et al., 2015; Mills et al., 
2016; Termeer et al., 2017; Sovacool, 2018). To some countries, SLR 
presents a security risk due to the scale of potential displacement 
and migration of people (Section 4.4.2.6). Climate change, and rising 
seas in particular, could compound sociopolitical stressors (Sovacool 
et al., 2015), challenge the efﬁcacy of prevailing legal processes 
(Byrne, 2012; Busch, 2018; Setzer and Vanhala, 2019), and spark or 
escalate conﬂict (Lusthaus, 2010; Nursey-Bray, 2017).
Complexity: SLR introduces novel and complex problems that are 
difﬁcult to understand and address (high conﬁdence; Moser et al., 
2012; Alford and Head, 2017; Wright and Nichols, 2018; Hall et al., 
2019). As a result of the preceding features of the SLR problem, and the 
complexity of the nonlinear interactions between biogeophysical and 
human systems, SLR challenges may be difﬁcult to frame, understand 
and respond to. Often, disciplinary science is not sufﬁcient for 
understanding complex problems like SLR and traditional technical 
problem solving may not be well suited for crafting enduring SLR 
responses (Lawrence et al., 2015; Termeer et al., 2015). SLR poses a 
challenge for bridging gaps between science, policy and practice (Hall 
et al., 2019). The complexity and rapid pace of SLR in some localities 
is also challenging traditional community decision making practices, 
for example, in some Paciﬁc Island communities (Nunn et al., 2014).
4.4.4 
Planning, Engagement and Decision Tools  
for Choosing Responses
4.4.4.1 
Introduction
A range of established and emerging planning, public participation 
and conﬂict resolution practices can help in making social choices 
and addressing governance challenges in responding to SLR 
(Section 4.4.4.2). Social choice and decision making processes may 
also involve the application of formal decision analysis methods for 
appraising and choosing responses (Section 4.4.4.3). Making social 
choices involves deciding which combination of decision methods, 
modes of participation, conﬂict resolution strategies, and planning 
processes to use when and how, and then implementing the resultant 
decisions, monitoring and reviewing progress over time, and making 
appropriate adjustments in the light of experience, change and 
emerging knowledge and needs. The legal literature on roles played 
by law (Byrne, 2012; Vidas, 2014; Reiblich et al., 2019; Setzer and 
Vanhala, 2019), or informal approaches such as indigenous decision 
making practices (Carter, 2018) were not assessed.
4.4.4.2 
Planning, Public Participation and Conﬂict Resolution 
in the Face of SLR
Land use or spatial planning has the potential to help communities 
prepare for the future and decide how to manage coastal activities 
and land use taking into account the uncertainty, complexity and 
contestation that characterise SLR (high conﬁdence; Hurlimann and 
March, 2012; Hurlimann et al., 2014; Berke and Stevens, 2016; King 
et al., 2016; Reiblich et al., 2017) Planners work with governing 
authorities, the private sector, and local communities to integrate and 
apply tailor-made decision analysis, public participation and conﬂict 
resolution approaches that can be institutionalised in statutory 
provisions, and aligned with informal institutional structures and 
processes carried out at various scales (Hurlimann and March, 2012; 
Smith and Glavovic, 2014; Berke and Stevens, 2016). 
Planning can play an important role in crafting SLR responses, 
addressing several of the governance challenges identiﬁed above 
(Section 4.4.3). Planning is future focused and can assist communities 
to develop and pursue a shared vision, and understand and address 
SLR concerns in locality-speciﬁc ways (Hurlimann and March, 2012; 
Berke and Stevens, 2016). Planning can help articulate and clarify 
roles and responsibilities through statutory planning provisions, 
complemented by non-statutory processes (Vella et al., 2016). It can 
build social and administrative networks that mobilise cross-scale 
SLR responses, and facilitate integration of diverse mitigation and 
adaptation goals alongside other public aspirations and policy 
imperatives (Hurlimann and March, 2012; Vella et al., 2016). Planning 
can also facilitate the establishment of collaborative regional forums 
that cross jurisdictional boundaries and assist local governments 
and other stakeholders to pool resources and coordinate roles 
and responsibilities across multiple governance levels, such as the 
Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact, USA (Shi 
et al., 2015; Vella et al., 2016). Regulatory planning can be used by 
governing authorities to steer future infrastructure, housing, industry 
and related development away from areas exposed to SLR (Hurlimann 
and March, 2012; Hurlimann et al., 2014; Smith and Glavovic, 2014; 
Berke and Stevens, 2016). 
The extent to which planning is effective in reducing coastal risk, 
however, varies widely between and within coastal nations (Glavovic 
and Smith, 2014; Shi et al., 2015; Cuevas et al., 2016; King et al., 2016; 
Woodruff and Stults, 2016). Planning can fail to prevent development 
in at-risk locations, and may even accelerate such development, as 
experienced in settings as diverse as Java, Indonesia (Suroso and 
Firman, 2018), the Philippines (Cuevas, 2018), Australia (Hurlimann 
et al., 2014), and the USA (Vella et al., 2016; Woodruff and Stults, 
2016). Planning has exacerbated sociospatial inequalities in cities 
like Boston, USA, Santiago, Chile, and Jakarta, Indonesia (Anguelovski 
et al., 2016). A study of vulnerability dynamics in Houston, New 
Orleans and Tampa, USA shows that vulnerability can be reinforced 
401

or ameliorated through adaptation planning and decision making 
processes (Kashem et al., 2016). Regulatory planning may be 
non-existent in some settings, such as informal settlements, or 
when used can paradoxically entrench vulnerability and compound 
risk (Berquist et al., 2015; Amoako, 2016; Ziervogel et al., 2016b). 
Planning practice is thus both a contributor to and an outcome of 
local politics and power. Recognising and navigating these challenges 
is key to realising the promise of planning for reducing SLR risk, and 
participatory planning processes that reconcile divergent interests 
are central to this endeavour (Forester, 2006; Smith and Glavovic, 
2014; Anguelovski et al., 2016; Cuevas et al., 2016).
Public participation refers to directly involving citizens in decision 
making processes rather than only indirectly via voting. Citizen 
participation is commonplace in public decision making that 
addresses important societal concerns like SLR (Sarzynski, 2015; 
Berke and Stevens, 2016; Gorddard et al., 2016; Baker and Chapin 
III, 2018; Yusuf et al., 2018b). Practices sit along a continuum from 
manipulation to minimal involvement and more empowering and 
self-determining practices (Arnstein, 1969; International Association 
for Public Participation, 2018). Public participation draws on a wide 
variety of tailored engagement processes and practices, from ‘serious 
games’ (Wu and Lee, 2015) to role-play simulations (Rumore et al., 
2016), and deliberative-analytical engagement (Webler et al., 2016). 
There has been a proliferation of public engagement approaches 
and practices applied to adaptation in recent decades (Webler 
et al., 2016; Kirshen et al., 2018; Mehring et al., 2018; Nkoana 
et al., 2018; Yusuf et al., 2018a; Uittenbroek et al., 2019). Increasing 
citizen participation in adaptation and other public decision making 
processes shifts the role of government from a chieﬂy steering 
and regulating role towards more responsive and enabling roles, 
sometimes referred to as co-design, co-production, and co-delivery 
of adaptation responses (Ziervogel et al., 2016a; Mees et al., 2019). 
Engagement strategies grounded in community deliberation can 
help to improve understanding about SLR and response options, 
reducing the polarising effect of alternative political allegiances and 
worldviews (Akerlof et al., 2016; Uittenbroek et al., 2019). Public 
participation has also the potential to successfully include vulnerable 
groups in multi-level adaptation processes (Kirshen et al., 2018), 
promote justice and enable transformative change (Broto et al., 
2015; Schlosberg et al., 2017). 
It is widely recognised that authentic and meaningful public 
participation is  important and  can help  in  crafting effective and 
enduring adaptation responses, but is invariably difﬁcult to achieve 
in practice (Barton et al., 2015; Cloutier et al., 2015; Sarzynski, 2015; 
Serrao-Neumann et al., 2015; Berke and Stevens, 2016; Chu et al., 
2016; Schlosberg et al., 2017; Baker and Chapin III, 2018; Kirshen et al., 
2018; Lawrence et al., 2018; Mehring et al., 2018; Lawrence et al., 
2019; Uittenbroek et al., 2019). There is limited empirical evidence 
that public participation per se improves environmental outcomes 
(Callahan, 2007; Reed, 2008; Newig and Fritsch, 2009). Major factors 
determining outcomes are tacit, including trust, environmental 
preferences, power relationships and the true motivations of sponsor 
and participants (Reed, 2008; Newig and Fritsch, 2009). Difﬁculties 
in realising the anticipated beneﬁts of public participation have been 
shown in coastal settings including Queensland, Australia (Burton 
and Mustelin, 2013), Germany’s Baltic Sea (Schernewski et al., 
2018), England (Mehring et al., 2018), Sweden (Brink and Wamsler, 
2019), and South Africa (Ziervogel, 2019). Research by Uittenbroek 
et al. (2019) in the Netherlands, for example, shows that public 
participation objectives are more probable if participation objectives 
and process design principles and practices are co-produced by 
community and government stakeholders. In some cities in the 
Global South, experience shows that a focus on building effective 
multi-sector governance institutions can facilitate ongoing public 
involvement in adaptation planning and implementation, and 
enhance long-term adaptation prospects (Chu, 2016b).
Conﬂict resolution refers to formal and informal processes that enable 
parties to create peaceful solutions for their disputes (Bercovitch et al., 
2008). They range from litigation and adjudication to more collaborative 
processes based on facilitation, mediation and negotiation (Susskind 
et al., 1999; Bercovitch et al., 2008). Such processes can be used in 
the public domain to make difﬁcult social choices. Whilst it may be 
impossible to eliminate controversy and disputes due to SLR, conﬂict 
resolution can be foundational for achieving effective, fair and just 
outcomes for coastal communities (Susskind et al., 2015; Nursey-Bray, 
2017). Whereas some responses to social conﬂict (see deﬁnition 
in Section  4.4.3.3) can be destructive (e.g.,  resorting to violence), 
constructive approaches to conﬂict resolution (e.g., negotiation and 
mediation) can help disputants satisfy their interests and even have 
transformational adaptation potential (Laws et al., 2014; Nursey-Bray, 
2017). Laws et al. (2014), for example, use the term ‘hot adaptation’ to 
describe adaptation efforts that harness the energy and engagement 
that conﬂict provokes; and create opportunities for public deliberation 
and social learning about complex problems like SLR. Such an approach 
has particular relevance in settings most at risk to SLR. Realising this 
potential is, however, challenging in the face of local politics and the 
differential power and inﬂuence of disputants. These realities have 
been accounted for in public conﬂict resolution scholarship and 
practice for many decades (Forester, 1987; Dukes, 1993; Forester, 2006), 
and lessons learned are beginning to be applied to adaptation (Laws 
et al., 2014; Nursey-Bray, 2017; Sultana and Thompson, 2017) and SLR 
response planning (Susskind et al., 2015). Conﬂict was turned into 
cooperation in some villages in ﬂoodplains in Bangladesh, for example, 
by facilitated dialogue and incentivised cooperation between local 
communities and government, with external facilitator assistance, 
leading to improved water security in a climate stressed environment 
(Sultana and Thompson, 2017). At a larger scale, the Mekong River 
Commission, with its water diplomacy framework, provides an 
institutional structure and processes, with technical support, and legal 
and strategic mechanisms, that help to negotiate solutions for complex 
delta problems and, in so doing, help avert widespread destruction of 
livelihoods and conﬂict (Kittikhoun and Staubli, 2018). 
Many of the techniques used in planning, public participation and 
conﬂict resolution, at times together with decision analysis and support 
tools, are being applied in combination. In New Zealand, for example, 
a participatory approach was used to combine dynamic adaptive

thereby helped to shift communities towards a longer-term view 
and towards considering a wider range of adaptation options and 
pathways. Such combined approaches are also sometimes referred to 
as Community Based Adaptation, which involve local people directly 
in understanding and addressing the climate change risks they face 
(Box 4.4). These processes and practices are used in many settings, 
from small, isolated indigenous communities to large-scale coastal 
infrastructure projects in both the Global North and South. See 
Table 4.9 in Section 4.4.5 for illustrative examples. 
4.4.4.3 
Decision Analysis Methods
4.4.4.3.1 Introduction
Decision analysis methods are formal methods that help to identify 
alternatives that perform best or well with regard to given objectives. 
An alternative (also called response option or, as a sequence of 
options over time: adaptation pathway) is a speciﬁc combination of 
SLR responses (See Section 4.4.3). Each alternative is characterised 
for each possible future state-of-the world (e.g.,  levels of SLR or 
socioeconomic development) by one or several attributes, which may 
measure any relevant social, ecological, or economic effect associated 
with choosing and implementing the alternative (Kleindorfer 
et al., 1993). Attributes commonly used include cost of adaptation 
alternatives, monetary and non-monetary beneﬁts of the SLR impacts 
avoided, or net present value (NPV), which is the difference between 
discounted monetised beneﬁts over time and discounted costs over 
time. Formal decision analysis is one way to support social choices 
that is generally suggested for decision support if decisions are 
complex and involve large investments, as is frequently the case in 
coastal contexts in the face of SLR. 
In order to be effective, decision analysis needs to be embedded in a 
governance process that accounts for societal needs and objectives 
(Sections 4.4.4.2 and 4.4.5). This is because decision analysis entails 
a number of normative choices about the objectives chosen, the 
criteria used, the speciﬁc methods and data applied, the set of 
alternatives considered, and the attributes used to characterise 
alternatives. These choices need to reﬂect the diversity of values, 
preference and goals of all stakeholders involved in and affected 
by a decision. Furthermore, decision analysis needs to consider 
all available knowledge,  including all major uncertainties in both 
climate and non-climate factors, ambiguities in expert opinions, 
and differences in approaches, because a partial consideration of 
uncertainty and ambiguity could misguide the choice of adaptation 
alternatives (high conﬁdence; Renn, 2008; Jones et al., 2014; Hinkel 
and Bisaro, 2016).
Since AR5, the literature on coastal decision analysis has advanced 
signiﬁcantly, speciﬁcally addressing the large uncertainty about 
post-2050 SLR through i) using robust decision approaches instead 
of expected utility, ii) iterating or adapting decisions over time, and 
iii) increasing ﬂexibility of responses. Each advance is elaborated 
below. Furthermore, the coastal decision analysis literature also 
stresses the consideration of multiple criteria or attributes, because 
adaptation often involves stakeholders with differing objectives 
and ways of valuing alternatives (Oddo et al., 2017). Many decision 
making methods combine each of the three advances highlighted 
here (Marchau et al., 2019). The suitability of each method depends 
strongly on the speciﬁc context, including available resources, 
technical capabilities, policy objectives, stakeholder preferences and 
available information.
4.4.4.3.2 Using robustness criteria instead of expected utility
A growing literature on decision analysis of coastal adaptation 
advocates the use of RDM approaches instead of maximising 
expected utility approaches (Hallegatte et al., 2012; Haasnoot et al., 
2013; Lempert et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2017). The core criterion to 
be considered for choosing between the two types of approaches 
is whether one is confronted with a situation of shallow or deep 
uncertainty (high conﬁdence) (Lempert and Schlesinger, 2001; Kwakkel 
et al., 2010; Kwakkel et al., 2016b; Hinkel et al., 2019). Uncertainty 
is shallow when a single unambiguous objective or subjective 
probability distribution can be attached to states-of-the-world. 
Uncertainty is deep, when this is not possible, either because there 
is no unambiguous method for deriving objective probabilities or 
the subjective probability judgements of parties involved differ 
(Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1; Type 2). 
Expected utility approaches can only be applied for identifying an 
optimal response in situations of shallow uncertainty. This is because 
these approaches require a probability distribution over states of 
the world in order to identify the optimal alternative which leads 
to the highest expected utility (i.e.,  the probability weighted sum 
of the utilities of all outcomes under a given alternative and all 
states-of-the-world; Simpson et al., 2016). A prominent example 
of this approach is cost-beneﬁt analysis under risk, which assesses 
expected outcomes across states of the world in terms of NPV (the 
discounted stream of net beneﬁts). Cost-beneﬁt analysis has several 
well-known limitations, such as its sensitivity to discount rates and 
the difﬁculty to monetise ecological, cultural and other intangible 
beneﬁts (Section  1.1.4) that have been widely discussed in the 
climate change literature (Chambwera et al., 2014; Kunreuther et al., 
2014; Dennig, 2018).
In the context of coastal adaptation, uncertainty is only shallow 
if projected SLR does not signiﬁcantly differ between low end 
(e.g.,  RCP2.6) and high end (e.g., RCP8.5) scenarios (Hinkel et al., 
2019). The point in time when this is the case (i.e., time of scenario 
divergence) depends on what difference in expected utility matters 
to the particular stakeholders involved in a decision. The time of 
scenario divergence also differs across locations. In locations where 
the internal sea level variability is large as compared to relative SLR, 
it takes longer before the differences in sea levels under low end and 
high end scenarios become apparent. Figure 4.15 illustrates this effect 
for the ESL projections of this report (Sections 4.2.3.2 and 4.2.3.4), 
following the approach of Hinkel et al. (2019). Under the assumption 
that a 10% statistical distance between the distributions of RCP2.6 
and RCP8.5 is decision relevant, scenario divergence occurs before 
2050 for approximately two thirds of coastal sites with sufﬁcient 
observational data, but for 7% of locations this occurs later than 2070.
403

Chapter 4

In principle, a single unambiguous probability distribution on future 
sea levels could also be attained beyond the time of scenario 
divergence by attributing subjective probabilities to emission 
scenarios, but individuals may signiﬁcantly disagree in their subjective 
probabilities, which again results in deep uncertainty (Lempert and 
Schlesinger, 2001; Stirling, 2010). For this reason, very few studies 
that assign subjective probabilities to emission scenarios are found in 
the literature (Woodward et al., 2014; Abadie, 2018). But even before 
the year of scenario divergence is reached, uncertainty about relative 
SLR can be deep, because of deep uncertainties about non-climatic 
contributors to relative sea level change, such as VLM during or after 
earthquakes and human-induced subsidence (Cross-Chapter  5 in 
Chapter 1; Section 4.2.2.4; Hinkel et al., 2019).
Under situations of deep uncertainty, RDM approaches aim to identify 
alternatives that perform reasonably well (i.e., ‘are robust’) under a 
wide range of states-of-the-world or scenarios and hence do not 
require probability assessments. These approaches include minimax 
or minimax regret (Savage, 1951), info gap theory (Ben-Haim, 2006), 
robust optimisation (Ben-Tal et al., 2009) and exploratory modelling 
methods that create a large ensemble of plausible future scenarios 
for each alternative, and then use search and visualisation techniques 
to extract robust alternatives (Lempert and Schlesinger, 2000). SLR 
examples of RDM include Brekelmans (2012) who minimise the 
average and maximum regret across a range of SLR scenarios for 
investments in dike rings in the Netherlands and Lempert et al. (2013) 
who apply RDM in Hoh-Chi-Minh City.
But even if SLR uncertainty is shallow, RDM are more suitable than 
expected utility approaches if parties involved or affected by a 
decision have a low uncertainty tolerance, because the goal of the 
uncertainty intolerant decision maker is to avoid major damages 
under most or all circumstances (Hinkel et al., 2019).
An adaptation strategy developed based on the maximisation of 
expected utility may not meet this goal, because worst case damages 
occurring can exceed expected damages by orders of magnitude.
The uncertainty tolerance of stakeholders is also determining how 
large of a SLR range needs to be considered in RDM. Stakeholders 
(i.e., those deciding and those affected by a decision) that have a 
high uncertainty tolerance (e.g., those planning for investments that 
can be very easily adapted) can use the combined likely range of 
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (0.29–1.10 m by 2100) for long-term adaptation 
decisions. For stakeholders with a low uncertainty tolerance (e.g. 
those planning for coastal safety in cities and long term investment in 
critical infrastructure) it is meaningful to also consider SLR above this 
range, because a 17% chance of GMSL exceeding this range under 
RCP8.5 is too high to be tolerated from this point of view (Ranger 
et al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2015; Hinkel et al., 2019).
Independent of the debate about whether to apply expected utility or 
robust decision making approaches, there is an extensive literature 
that applies scenario-based cost-beneﬁt analysis. For example, 
this approach has been applied for setting the safety standards of 
Dutch dike rings (Kind, 2014; Eijgenraam et al., 2016), exploring 
future protection alternatives for New York (Aerts et al., 2014), Ho 
Chi Minh City (Scussolini et al., 2017), and for many other locations. 
Scenario-based cost-beneﬁt analysis differs from cost-beneﬁt analysis 
under risk discussed above in that scenario-based cost-beneﬁt analysis 
is not applied to rank alternatives across scenarios, but a ‘separate’ 
cost-beneﬁt analysis is applied within each emission or SLR scenario 
considered. While this identiﬁes the optimal alternative under each 
scenario, it does not formally address the problem faced by a coastal 
decision maker, namely to decide across scenarios (Lincke and Hinkel, 
2018). Nevertheless, the results of scenario-based cost-beneﬁt analysis 
(i.e., NPV of each alternative under each scenario) provide guidance 
for decision makers and can also be used as inputs (i.e., as attributes) 
to robust and ﬂexible decision making approaches.
4.4.4.3.3 Adapting decisions over time
Irrespective of whether expected utility or robustness criteria are 
applied, there is high conﬁdence that an effective way of dealing with 
large uncertainties is adaptive decision making (also called iterative 
decision making, adaptive planning or adaptive management), which 
maintains that decision and decision analysis should be conducted 
within an iterative policy cycle. This approach includes monitoring of 
sea level variables and evaluation of alternatives in this light in order 
to learn from past decisions and collect information to inform future 
decisions (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Barnett et al., 2014; Burch et al., 
2014; Jones et al., 2014; Wise et al., 2014; Kelly, 2015; Lawrence and 
Haasnoot, 2017). Such a staged approach is especially suitable for 
coastal adaptation due to the long lead and lifetimes of many coastal 
adaptation measures and the deep uncertainties in future sea levels 
(Hallegatte, 2009; Kelly, 2015). Prominent representatives of methods 
that entail this idea are Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (Haasnoot 
et al., 2013) and Dynamic Adaptation Planning (Walker et al., 
2001). An important prerequisite for any adaptive decision-making 
approach is a monitoring system that can detect sea level signals 
sufﬁciently early to enable the required responses (Hermans et al., 
2017; Haasnoot et al., 2018; Stephens et al., 2018).
In recent years, many different frameworks for adaptive decision 
making have been put forward, including Adaptive Policy Making 
(Walker et al., 2001), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (Haasnoot 
et al., 2013), Dynamic Adaptive Planning (Walker et al., 2013), 
Iterative risk management (Jones et al., 2014) and Engineering 
Options Analysis (de Neufville and Smet, 2019). Each frameworks 
emphasises particular aspects of adaptive decision making and has 
merits in speciﬁc situations depending on the preferences, goals, 
uncertainties and information at stake (Marchau et al., 2019). 
Nevertheless, all of these frameworks share the following generic 
and iterative steps
1. Set the stage: Identify current situation, objectives, options 
(alternatives) and uncertainties.
2. Develop a dynamic plan, which consists of a basic plan plus 
contingency actions to be carried out based on observed triggers.
3. Implement basic plan and monitor system for triggers.
4. Monitor and act upon triggers.

4.4.4.3.4 Increasing ﬂexibility of responses
An idea closely related to adaptive decision making is to keep future 
alternatives open by favouring ﬂexible alternatives over non-ﬂexible 
ones. An alternative is said to be ‘ﬂexible’ if it allows switching to 
other alternatives once the implemented alternative is no longer 
effective. For example, a ﬂexible protection approach would be to 
build small dikes on foundations designed for higher dikes, in order 
to be able to raise dikes in the future should SLR necessitate this.
A prominent and straightforward method that addresses the objective 
of ﬂexibility is adaptation pathways analysis (Haasnoot et al., 2011; 
Haasnoot et al., 2012), which is one component of Dynamic Adaptive 
Policy Pathways. The method graphically represents alternative 
combinations of measures over time together with information on 
the conditions under which alternatives cease to be effective in 
meeting agreed objectives, as well as possible alternatives that will 
then be available. As time and SLR progress, monitoring may trigger 
a decision to switch to another alternative. Adaptation pathway 
analysis has been widely applied both in the scientiﬁc literature as 
well as in practical cases. Applications after AR5 include Indonesia 
(Butler et al., 2014), New York City (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014), 
Singapore (Buurman and Babovic, 2016) and Australia (Lin and 
Shullman, 2017). In New Zealand, the method has been included in 
national guidance for coastal hazard and climate change decision 
making (Lawrence et al., 2018). There is high conﬁdence that the 
method is useful in interaction with decision makers and other 
stakeholders, helping to identify possible alternative sequences of 
measures over time, avoiding lock-in, and showing decision makers 
that there are several possible pathways leading to the same desired 
future (Haasnoot et al., 2012; Haasnoot et al., 2013; Brown et al., 
2014; Werners et al., 2015).
Alternatives can also be characterised through multiple attributes 
such as costs, effectiveness, co-beneﬁts, social acceptability, etc., 
which in turn can be used in multi-attribute decision making methods 
(Haasnoot et al., 2013). An important attribute is transfer cost, which 
is the cost of course correction (switching from one alternative to 
another), reﬂecting the potential for path dependency (Haasnoot 
et al., 2019). Delaying decisions and opting for ﬂexible measures 
introduces extra costs, such as transfer costs. Also, ﬂexible measures 
are often more expensive than inﬂexible ones, and damages may 
occur whilst delaying the decision. An important question therefore 
is whether it is cheaper to implement a ﬂexible measure now or to 
wait and implement a less ﬂexible (i.e., cheaper) measure later in 
time when more information is at hand.
Technically more demanding methods such as real-options analysis 
(Dixit et al., 1994), and decision tree analysis (Conrad, 1980), can 
also ﬁnd pathways that are economically efﬁcient in terms of 
ﬂexibility and timing of adaptation. There is little application of 
these approaches in the SLR literature. For example, Woodward et al. 
(2014) applied real-options analysis to determine ﬂood defences 
around the Thames Estuary, London, England; Buurman and Babovic 
(2016) for climate-prooﬁng drainage networks in Singapore; Dawson 
et al. (2018) for coastal rail infrastructure in southern England; and 
Kim et al. (2018) for assessing ﬂood defences in southern England. 
A requirement for applying real-options analysis and decision tree 
analysis is to quantify today how much will have been learned at 
a given point in time in the future. The few applications of these 
methods to SLR-related decisions in the literature have generally used 
ad-hoc assumptions. For example, Woodward et al. (2011) assumed 
either perfect learning (i.e., in 2040, which SLR trajectory is occurring 
will be known) or no learning (i.e., uncertainty ranges and conﬁdence 
in these remains as today). Others have derived learning rates from 
comparing past progress in SLR projections and then applied these to 
the future. An example is given by Dawson et al. (2018) who derive 
learning rates from the 2002 and 2009 SLR projections of the UK 
Climate Impacts Programme and apply these in real-options analysis.
4.4.4.3.5 Research needs
Four general gaps can be identiﬁed in the literature. First, the 
generation of SLR information is insufﬁciently coupled to the use of 
this information in decision analysis. This constitutes a limitation, as 
different coastal decision contexts require different decision analysis 
methods, which in turn require different SLR information. Speciﬁcally, 
applications of decision analysis methods generally convert existing 
sea level information to ﬁt their method, often misinterpreting 
the information, making arbitrary assumptions or losing essential 
information in the process (Hinkel et al., 2015; Bakker et al., 2017; Van 
der Pol and Hinkel, 2018). Second, with the exception of adaptation 
pathway analysis, methods of robust and ﬂexible decision making 
are under-represented in the literature despite their suitability (Van 
der Pol and Hinkel, 2018). Third, research is necessary to compare 
the various methods, to identity which methods are most suitable in 
which context and to develop consistent categorisations of methods 
(Hallegatte et al., 2012; Haasnoot et al., 2013; Hinkel et al., 2015; 
Watkiss et al., 2015; Dittrich et al., 2016; Suckall et al., 2018). Fourth, 
future research needs to address how to embed decision analysis 
better in real world planning and decision making processes, 
recognising that adaptation to SLR is a multi-stakeholder process 
often characterised by conﬂicting interests and interdependence 
between stakeholders (Section  4.4.3). Addressing these gaps 
requires closer cooperation between SLR sciences, decision science, 
and planning and governance scholars. An underlying challenge is 
to design and integrate relevant formal decision making approaches 
into the heterogeneous reality of local planning and decision 
making cultures, institutions, processes and practices, often with 
community-speciﬁc needs and requirements (see Box 4.4).

Box 4.4 |  Community Based Experiences: Canadian Arctic and Hawkes Bay, New Zealand
Climate-Change Adaptation on the Canadian Arctic Coast
Communities of the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR), established under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement (Government of Canada, 
1984), include the delta communities of Aklavik and Inuvik (the regional hub) and the coastal hamlets of Tuktoyaktuk, Paulatuk, Sachs 
Harbour, and Ulukhaktok. The Inuvialuit Regional Corporation (IRC) administers Inuvialuit lands, a portfolio of businesses, and social and 
cultural services, including co-management of food harvest resources. Other social, education, health, and infrastructure services are 
managed by the Government of the Northwest Territories and municipal Councils. Community Corporations and Hunters and Trappers 
Committees handle other aspects of governance and socioeconomic development. Very high ground-ice content renders the coast and 
coastal infrastructure in this region sensitive to rising temperatures and largely precludes conventional hard shore protection. Higher 
temperatures (>3ºC rise since 1948), combined with rising sea level and a lengthening open-water season, contribute to accelerating 
coastal erosion, threatening infrastructure, cultural resources, and the long-term viability of Tuktoyaktuk Harbour, while impacting 
winter travel on ice, access to subsistence resources, food security, safety and well-being (Lamoureux et al., 2015). Despite ongoing 
shore recession, there is strong attachment to the most vulnerable sites and a reluctance to relocate. Adaptation challenges include 
technical issues (e.g., the ice-rich substrate, sea ice impacts), high transportation costs (until recent completion of an all-weather road 
to Tuktoyaktuk, heavy or bulky material had to come in by sea or ice road), availability of experienced labour, and, crucially, ﬁnancial 
resources. Other inhibitors of adaptation include access to knowledge in suitable forms for uptake, gaps in understanding, research 
readiness, and institutional barriers related to multiple levels of decision making (Ford et al., 2016a). The IRC, as the indigenous 
leadership organisation in the ISR, is moving to play a more proactive role in driving adaptation at the regional level (IRC, 2016), 
as indigenous leaders across the country are demanding more control of the northern research agenda for adaptation action (Bell, 
2016; ITK, 2018). For a number of years, IRC has promoted community-based monitoring, incorporating Inuvialuit knowledge in 
partnership with trusted research collaborators. Recently IRC is exploring partnership with the community-based ice awareness service 
and social enterprise, SmartICE Inc. Despite the inherent adaptability of Inuit culture, concentration in locality bound communities 
dependent on physical infrastructure has increased vulnerability, as changing climate has raised exposure. Various government and 
academic initiatives and tools over many years to promote resilience and adaptation strategies have had limited impact. Current 
engagement supporting locally driven knowledge acquisition and management capacity, combined with IRC institutional leadership 
with government support, are expected to enable a more effective co-designed and co-delivered adaptation agenda.
Clifton to Tangoio Coastal Hazards Strategy 2120 Hawkes Bay, New Zealand:  
A community-based and science-informed decision making process
New Zealand is applying tools for decision making under deep uncertainty (Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017; Lawrence et al., 2019)  
to address the changing risk and uncertainties related to SLR impacts on coastal settlements. An opportunity arose in 2017 for 
the Resilience to Nature’s Challenges National Science Challenge, “The Living Edge” research project (https://resiliencechallenge. 
nz/edge), to co-develop a Coastal Hazards Strategy for the Clifton to Tangoio coast in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. The Strategy,  
a joint council/ community/ iwi Māori initiative (Kench et al., 2018), planned to use Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) within 
their decision framework – a static tool in time and space, unsuited for decision making where changing risk and uncertainties exist 
over long timeframes. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (Haasnoot et al., 2013) approach and a modiﬁed Real Options Analysis 
were proposed by the ‘Edge Team’ and integrated with MCDA (Lawrence et al., 2019) in a process comprising a Technical Advisory 
Group of councils and two community panels of directly affected communities, infrastructure agencies, business, conservation interests, 
and iwi Māori. Many adaptation options and pathways were assessed for their ability to reduce risk exposure and maintain ﬂexibility 
for switching pathways over a 100-year timeframe, which is the planning timeframe mandated by the New Zealand Coastal Policy 
Statement (Minister of Conservation, 2010) with the force of law under the Resource Management Act, 1991. The recently revised 
New Zealand national coastal hazards and climate change guidance for local government (Bell et al., 2017a) provided context. This 
novel assessment, engagement and planning approach to the formulation of a Coastal Hazards Strategy was undertaken through a 
non-statutory planning process. The agreed options and pathways have yet to be implemented through statutory processes that will 
test the risk tolerance of the wider community. This example illustrates how tailor-made assessment that addresses SLR uncertainty 
and change by keeping options open and reducing path-dependency, and engagement and planning processes can be initiated with 
leadership across councils, sectors and stakeholders, before being implemented, thus reducing contestation. Lessons learned include 
the central role of: leadership, governance and iwi Māori; Local Authority collaboration; taking time to build trust; independent 
knowledge brokers for credibility; nuanced project leadership and facilitation, enabling a community-based process. The preferred 
intervention options and pathways have been agreed for implementation. The remaining challenges are to cost the range of actions, 
decide funding formulae, develop physical and socioeconomic signals and triggers for monitoring changing risk, embed the strategy 
in statutory plans and practices, and socialise the strategy with the wider public in the context of competing priorities.

Enabling Conditions and Lessons Learned 
From ‘Practice’
In addition to the literature on planning, public participation, conﬂict 
resolution and decision making assessed in the last Section, much is 
being learned from practical experiences gained in adapting to climate 
change and SLR at the coast. Some salient enabling conditions and 
lessons learnt are illustrated in Table  4.9 through case studies or 
examples of real-world experience in diverse coastal communities 
around the world, structured according to the ﬁve overarching SLR 
governance challenges identiﬁed in Section  4.4.3. In these cases, 
the following stands out as being foundational for enabling the 
implementation of SLR responses and addressing the governance 
challenges that arise. First, effective SLR responses take a long-term 
perspective (e.g., 100 years and beyond) and explicitly account for the 
uncertainty of locality-speciﬁc risks beyond 2050. Second, given the 
locality-speciﬁc but cross-cutting nature of SLR impacts, improving 
cross-scale and cross-domain coordination of SLR responses may 
be beneﬁcial. Third, prioritising social vulnerability and equity in SLR 
responses may be essential because SLR impacts and risks are spread 
unevenly across society, and within and between coastal communities. 
Fourth, safe community arenas for working together constructively can 
help to resolve social conﬂict arising from SLR. Fifth, a sharp increase 
may be needed in governance capabilities to tackle the complex 
problems caused by SLR. There is, however, no one-size-ﬁts-all solution 
to SLR, and responses need to be tailored to the environmental, social, 
economic, political, technological, and cultural context in which they 
are to be implemented. Enablers that work in one context might not 
be effective in another case. As sea level rises, more experience in 
addressing SLR governance challenges will be gained, which can in 
turn be evaluated in order to obtain a better contextual understanding 
of enabling conditions and effective SLR governance.

2019) and Bangladesh (Paprocki and Huq, 2018). Lessons include:
 – Develop shared coastal visions (Tuts et al., 2015; Brown et al., 2016; OECD, 2019)
 – Use participatory planning processes that respect and reconcile different values, belief systems and cultures 
(Flynn et al., 2018)
 – Address power imbalances and human development imperatives (Broto et al., 2015; Butler et al., 2016a) 
Long-term adaptation pathways have been developed in New Zealand using ‘serious games’ 
(Flood et al., 2018) and hybrid processes to integrate decision analysis methods (Section 4.4.2) with public partici-
pation and planning (Section 4.4.3) (Cradock-Henry et al., 2018; Lawrence et al., 2019). Lessons include: 
 – Develop enabling national guidance, policy and legislation that requires a long-term focus (e.g., 100 years) 
and prioritises measures to minimise risk escalation
 – Secure buy-in from key governance actors
 – Involve coastal stakeholders in adaptation planning
 – Draw on local, indigenous and scientiﬁc knowledges 
Avoid new development commitments 
in high-risk locations (Section 4.4.3) 
(medium evidence, high agreement)
(Hurlimann and March, 2012; Glavovic

Tuts et al., 2015; Berke and Stevens, 2016; 
Butler et al., 2016b; OECD, 2019)
Spatial planning to regulate development at risk from SLR is underway in many locations, including Victoria, 
Australia (Hurlimann et al., 2014) and Florida, USA (Butler et al., 2016a; Vella et al., 2016). Limiting future develop-
ment in high risk areas is much easier than dealing with existing assets at risk (Tuts et al., 2015; OECD, 2019)
Proactive managed retreat through ﬂexible, tailor-made provisions that address distinctive local circum-
stances is under way in, for example, USA and Australia, revealing the importance of understanding risks politi-
cians face from local opposition, and distributional impacts (Dyckman et al., 2014; Gibbs, 2016; Siders, 2019). Post 
Hurricane Sandy managed retreat from Staten Island, New York City, USA, was enabled by community receptivity 
to buyouts and political expedience (Koslov, 2019; Box 4.1). Lessons include: 
 – Limit new development commitments in high risk areas
 – Facilitate property abandonment as inundation occurs 
 – Leverage the window of opportunity coastal disasters create (Kousky, 2014)

Pinto et al., 2018; Clar, 2019; Pittman 
and Armitage, 2019)
In the Lesser Antilles multiple state and non-state actors are working together, building trust, and coor-
dinating activities through decentralisation and self-organisation (Pittman and Armitage, 2019). Lessons 
include:
 – Participation in collaborative projects 
 – Multilateral agreements between states
 – Boundary spanning organisations connecting governance actors, citizens and states
 – Extreme events can be a catalyst for raising awareness and political salience
 – Leadership by central actors and capacitated teams 
 – Mobilise capabilities of communities and non-state actors 
In South Devon, UK, decentralisation, privatisation and fragmentation impacts adaptation (Den Uyl and 
Russel, 2018). Lessons include:
 – Identify policy inconsistencies and clarify problem-ownership, responsibility and accountability
 – Explore ways to leverage national funding to support local action 
 – Establish networks to facilitate interaction, dialogue and coordination 
Social learning, experimentation 
and innovation inform technical 
solutions, build shared understand-
ing and develop locally appropriate 
SLR responses (high conﬁdence).
(Dyckman et al., 2014; Glavovic and Smith,

2015; Chu et al., 2018; McFadgen 
and Huitema, 2018; Mazeka, 2019; 
Wolfram et al., 2019) 
Innovation is underway to enhance social learning, reﬂexivity and coalition building (Chu et al., 2018; 
Bellinson and Chu, 2019; Wolfram et al., 2019), e.g., Surat, India (Chu, 2016a; Chu, 2016b), Santos, Brazil (Marengo 
et al., 2019), Portland, USA (Fink, 2019), and port cities in Europe and East Asia (Blok and Tschötschel, 2016), In 
Surat, for example, adaptation experiments created valuable arenas for engaging governance actors and stakehold-
ers, understanding climate and development co-beneﬁts, and testing new ideas (Chu, 2016b). Lessons include:
 – Design experiments to account for how local political economic factors shape adaptation, for example, under-
standing local history and politics reveals how adaptation trade-offs are made in city decision making
 – Ensure experiments generate socioeconomic beneﬁts and climate-development co-beneﬁts 
Accelerate social learning and governance innovations through transnational municipal networks 
together with local efforts (Hughes et al., 2018), with processes developed and institutionalised through political 
negotiation, e.g., Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Berkeley, USA (Bellinson and Chu, 2019)
Equity 
and social 
vulnerability
Recognise the political nature of adap-
tation and explicitly address vulnerabil-
ity and equity implications to achieve 
enduring, enabling impact of responses 
(high conﬁdence). 
(Eriksen et al., 2015; Sovacool et al., 2015;

OECD, 2019)
Rights-based approach to participatory adaptation planning in Maputo, Mozambique, fosters a more 
inclusive and potentially fairer city (Broto et al., 2015). Lessons include: 
 – Expose drivers of structural inequity and vulnerability 
 – Link adaptation and human development imperatives
 – Raise awareness and public support for adaptation with equity
Race-aware adaptation planning can reveal racial inequalities and overcome passive indifference as 
shown in, for example, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA (Hardy et al., 2017). Lessons include: 
 – Develop an understanding of historical racial drivers of coastal land ownership, development and risk
 – Address barriers African Americans face in participating in adaptation planning 
Focus on enabling community capabili-
ties for responding to SLR, where neces-
sary complementing community knowl-
edge, skills and resources, and political 
inﬂuence and problem solving abilities, 
with external assistance and govern-
ment support (high conﬁdence). 
(Schlosberg, 2012; Musa et al., 2016; Vedeld 
et al., 2016; Elrick-Barr et al., 2017; Warrick 
et al., 2017; Dolšak and Prakash, 2018)
Various professionals can play valuable support roles in leveraging and building adaptive capacity and resil-
ience of small island communities, recognising diverse needs and capabilities (Robinson, 2017; Weir et al., 2017; 
Kelman, 2018; Petzold and Magnan, 2019). For example, in poor Caribbean communities, social workers are helping 
strengthen social capital, enabling individuals to understand and integrate risk, resilience and sustainability prin-
ciples into day-to-day decision making, and promoting socially and environmentally just adaptation (Joseph, 2017).
In the Solomon Islands, Paciﬁc, community-based approaches enhance community capacity to work with 
external organisations to plan together, obtain resources, and respond to SLR on their own terms (Warrick et al., 
2017). The value of integrating traditional community responses with local government efforts has been demon-
strated in Micronesian islands (Nunn et al., 2017b).
Local collective action in Monkey River, Belize, helped to overcome power asymmetries and to obtain 
support otherwise unavailable to vulnerable community members. Working with journalists, researchers and 
local NGOs, was key for villagers to have concerns heard and a solution found for coastal erosion (Karlsson and 
Hovelsrud, 2015).
Rural coastal community resilience boosted in Albemarle Pamlico Peninsula of North Carolina, USA, by 
focused attention on local needs through capacity building, and ensuring local voices heard in adaptation planning 
(Jurjonas and Seekamp, 2018).

Social conﬂict
Social conﬂict can be reduced by 
tailor-made design and facilitation of 
participation processes, and involving

(Burton and Mustelin, 2013; Berke and

Public participation has been foundational for South Africa’s coastal management, risk reduction and 
adaptation efforts since 1994 (Celliers et al., 2013; Daron and Colenbrander, 2015; Desportes and Colenbrander, 
2016; Glavovic et al., 2018; Colenbrander, 2019). Lessons include:
 – Create opportunities to understand and address technical, sociopolitical and economic realities in an integrated 
way (Colenbrander and Sowman, 2015; Daron and Colenbrander, 2015)
 – Incorporate conﬂict resolution mechanisms into engagement processes (Daron and Colenbrander, 2015; 
Colenbrander et al., 2016; Colenbrander and Bavinck, 2017)
 – Align informal engagement processes with formal statutory provisions (Colenbrander and Bavinck, 2017), taking 
into account visible formal procedures and ‘invisible’ and informal ways in which knowledge is shared and 
shapes government decision making (Leck and Roberts, 2015)
 – Independent facilitators can play a crucial role bringing contending parties together; local government ofﬁcials 
can work as bureaucratic activists to create more inclusive, iterative and reﬂexive participation (Desportes and 
Colenbrander, 2016)
 – Sustain engagement, sequence participatory interventions with political and bureaucratic cycles (Pasquini et al., 
2013) and secure enabling resources, including channelling adaptation ﬁnance to local level (Colenbrander, 2019) 
 – Use practical ways to involve historically disadvantaged and socially vulnerable groups and communities, for 
example, by choosing accessible locations, language(s) and culturally appropriate meeting protocols (Sowman 
and Gawith, 1994; Ziervogel et al., 2016b)
 – Dedicated environmental champions within local political leadership play a key role in mainstreaming adaptation 
into local decision making (Pasquini et al., 2015)
Social conﬂict can be managed by cre-
ating safe arenas for inclusive, informed 
and meaningful deliberation, negotia-
tion and collaborative problem-solving 
(medium evidence, high agreement).

Turning conﬂict into cooperation in Baragaon village, northeast Bangladesh, and eight villages in Narial 
district, southwest Bangladesh: A ﬂexible and enabling process, founded on local institutions judged robust 
and fair, prompted government investment in communities beyond their traditional focus on water infrastructure, 
paid attention to local social dynamics and reduced elite domination and local conﬂict (Sultana & Thompson 2017). 
Lessons include: 
 – Use local knowledge to inform adaptation actions
 – Encourage institutional improvisation to address local concerns, for example, shifting government investment 
from water infrastructure to community development
 – Use external facilitation
 – Incentivise participation by disadvantaged groups 
Innovative collective coastal risk management process, New England (USA) Climate Adaptation Project, 
developed by university researchers with partner communities to address coastal conﬂict by: 
 – Building community risk literacy, optimism and collaborative problem-solving capacity to take action 
 – Joint fact-ﬁnding, scenario planning, negotiating trade-offs, facilitated public dialogue, and securing support for 
collaborative adaptation 
 – Establishing forums for ongoing public deliberation and social learning; and committing to continual adjustments 
in face of change (Rumore, 2014; Susskind et al., 2015)
Complexity
Drawing upon multiple knowledge  
systems to co-design and co-produce 
SLR responses results in more accept-
able and implementable responses 
(high conﬁdence).
(Dannevig and Aall, 2015; Dutra et al., 
2015; Sovacool et al., 2015; Desportes 
and Colenbrander, 2016; Adger et al., 2017; 
Betzold and Mohamed, 2017; Onat et al., 
2018; Warner et al., 2018b; St. John III 
and Yusuf, 2019)
The merits of drawing on scientiﬁc and local and indigenous knowledges is recognised in diverse set-
tings such as Australia (Dutra et al., 2015), Comoros (Betzold and Mohamed, 2017), Arctic (Flynn et al., 2018; 
Huntington et al., 2019), Canada (Chouinard et al., 2015; Chouinard et al., 2017), Portugal (Costas et al., 2015) 
and Brazil (Marengo et al., 2019). 
Storytelling can build shared knowledge and understanding because stories are engaging, help people visu-
alise problems, see things from different positions, and recognise shared goals (Dutra et al., 2015; Elrick-Barr et al., 
2017). Māori, indigenous people of New Zealand, use oral history and storytelling to describe their relationship 
to the coast, which informs how New Zealand responds to SLR (Carter, 2018; Lawrence et al., 2018). 
Gaps between SLR science, policy and practice can be bridged by adaptation policy experiments 
with support of actors and organisations who work across organisational boundaries to bring parties 
together (Dannevig and Aall, 2015; St. John III and Yusuf, 2019).

The Dutch Delta Programme aims to future-proof the Netherlands against SLR (Bloemen et al., 2019). 
Lessons learned in building governance capabilities to deal with associated complex problems include (Dewulf and 
Termeer, 2015; Bloemen et al., 2018; Bloemen et al., 2019):
 – Committing to long-term policy implementation at Cabinet level 
 – Allocate necessary dedicated budget and build capacity of government agencies to tackle complex problems,  
for example, Senate resolution and programme uniting government and knowledge institutes on adaptation
 – Flexible and robust governance approaches and solutions build resilience, for example, independent programme 
alongside traditional administrative structures is more agile 
 – Adaptation pathways help overcome the temporal mismatch between short-term decisions and long-term goals, 
explicitly accounting for uncertainty
 – Enabling provisions for ﬁt-for-purpose local-level policy and practice are key to translating national programme 
goals into local action, for example, liaison ofﬁcers can bridge local, regional and national decision making arenas
 – Institutionalise monitoring and lesson learning (e.g., annual reporting to parliament, forums for politicians to 
share experiences) to track progress, deal with multiple legitimate perspectives and tackle emergent problems
 – Responsive governance arrangements address competing demands legitimately and timeously, for example, 
steering groups, workshops and social media reveal stakeholder concerns
 – Policy deadlocks or lock-in due to vested interests or short-term priorities can be tackled by taking a long-term 
perspective, exploring alternative scenarios and incentivising novel solutions
4.4.6 
Towards Climate Resilient Development Pathways
Our assessment shows that failure to mitigate GHG emissions or to 
adapt to SLR will cause major disruptions to many low-lying coastal 
communities and jeopardise achievement of all UN SDGs and other 
societal aspirations. Immediate and ambitious GHG emissions 
reduction is necessary (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) to contain the 
rate and magnitude of SLR, and consequently adaptation prospects. 
Under unmitigated emissions (RCP8.5), coastal societies, especially 
poorer, rural and small islands societies, will struggle to maintain 
their livelihoods and settlements during the 21st century (Sections 
4.3.4; 4.4.2). Without mitigation, sea levels will continue to rise for 
centuries, reaching 2.3–5.4 m by 2300 (likely range) and much more 
beyond (Section 4.2.3.5), making adaptation extremely challenging, 
if not impossible, for all low-lying coasts, including more intensively 
developed urbanised coasts. But even with ambitious mitigation 
(RCP2.6), sea levels will continue to rise, reaching 0.6–1.1 m by 2300 
(likely range; Figure  4.2 Panel B). Hence, adaptation will continue 
to be imperative irrespective of the uncertainties about future GHG 
emissions and key physical processes such as those determining the 
Antarctic contribution to SLR. Our assessment also shows that all types 
of responses, from hard protection to EbA, advance and retreat, have 
important and synergistic roles to play in an integrated and sequenced 
response to SLR. The merits of a particular type of response, at a 
particular point in time, critically depends on the biophysical, cultural, 
economic, technical, institutional and political context.
In this context, AR5 put forward the vision of Climate Resilient 
Development Pathways, which is “a continuing process for 
managing changes in the climate and other driving forces affecting 
development, combining ﬂexibility, innovativeness, and participative 
problem solving with effectiveness in mitigating and adapting to 
climate change” (Denton et al., 2014: 1106). Charting Climate 
Resilient Development Pathways in the face of rising sea level 
depends on how well mitigation, adaption and other sustainable 
development efforts are combined, and the governance challenges 
introduced by SLR are resolved. There are no panaceas for solving 
these complex issues. However, the wise application of the planning, 
public participation, conﬂict resolution, and decision analysis 
methods assessed above can help coastal communities, cities and 
settlements develop locally relevant, enabling and adaptive SLR 
responses. Difﬁcult social choices will nonetheless need to be made 
as sea levels continue to rise. Given the SLR projections outlined here, 
it is concluded that global resilience and sustainability prospects 
depend, to a large extent, on how effectively coastal communities 
develop and implement ambitious, forward-looking adaptation plans 
in synchrony with drastic mitigation of GHG emissions.

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 4.1 | 
 What challenges does the inevitability of sea level rise present to coastal communities 
and how can communities adapt?
As the global climate changes, rising sea levels, combined with high tides, storms and ﬂooding, put coastal and island 
communities increasingly at risk. Protection can be achieved by building dikes or seawalls and by maintaining natural features 
like mangroves or coral reefs. Communities can also adjust by reclaiming land from the sea and adapting buildings to cope 
with ﬂoods. However, all measures have their limits, and once these are reached people may ultimately have to retreat. 
Choices made today inﬂuence how coastal ecosystems and communities can respond to sea level rise (SLR) in the future. 
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would not just reduce risks, but also open up more adaptation options.
Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) is rising and it will continue to do so for centuries. Sustainable development 
aspirations are at risk because many people, assets and vital resources are concentrated along low-lying coasts 
around the world. Many coastal communities have started to consider the implications of SLR. Measures are 
being taken to address coastal hazards exacerbated by rising sea level, such as coastal ﬂooding due to extreme 
events (e.g. storm surges, tropical cyclones, coastal erosion and salinisation). However, many coastal communities 
are still not sufﬁciently adapted to today’s ESLs.
Scientiﬁc evidence about SLR is clear: GMSL rose by 1.5 mm yr–1 during the period 1901–1990, accelerating to 
3.6 mm yr–1 during the period 2005–2015. It is likely to rise 0.61–1.10 m by 2100 if global GHG emissions are not 
mitigated (RCP8.5). However, a rise of two or more metres cannot be ruled out. It could rise to more than 3 m 
by 2300, depending on the level of GHG emissions and the response of the AIS, which are both highly uncertain. 
Even if efforts to mitigate emissions are very effective, ESL events that were rare over the last century will 
become common before 2100, and even by 2050 in many locations. Without ambitious adaptation, the combined 
impact of hazards like coastal storms and very high tides will drastically increase the frequency and severity of 
ﬂooding on low-lying coasts.
SLR, as well as the context for adaptation, will vary regionally and locally, thus action to reduce risks related 
to SLR takes different forms depending on the local circumstances. ‘Hard protection’, like dikes and seawalls, 
can effectively reduce risk under two or more metres of SLR but it is inevitable that limits will be reached. Such 
protection produces beneﬁts that exceed its costs in low-lying coastal areas that are densely populated, as is the 
case for many coastal cities and some small islands, but in general, poorer regions will not be able to afford hard 
protection. Maintaining healthy coastal ecosystems, like mangroves, seagrass beds or coral reefs, can provide ‘soft 
protection’ and other beneﬁts. SLR can also be ‘accommodated’ by raising buildings on the shoreline, for example. 
Land can be reclaimed from the sea by building outwards and upwards. In coastal locations where the risk is very 
high and cannot be effectively reduced, ‘retreat’ from the shoreline is the only way to eliminate such risk. Avoiding 
new development commitments in areas exposed to coastal hazards and SLR also avoids additional risk.
For those unable to afford protection, accommodation or advance measures, or when such measures are no 
longer viable or effective, retreat becomes inevitable. Millions of people living on low-lying islands face this 
prospect, including inhabitants of Small Island Developing States (SIDS), of some densely populated but less 
intensively developed deltas, of rural coastal villages and towns, and of Arctic communities who already face 
melting sea ice and unprecedented changes in weather. The resultant impacts on distinctive cultures and ways 
of life could be devastating. Difﬁcult trade-offs are therefore inevitable when making social choices about rising 
sea level. Institutionalising processes that lead to fair and just outcomes is challenging, but vitally important.
Choices being made now about how to respond to SLR profoundly inﬂuence the trajectory of future exposure 
and vulnerability to SLR. If concerted emissions mitigation is delayed, risks will progressively increase as SLR 
accelerates. Prospects for global climate-resilience and sustainable development therefore depend in large part 
on coastal nations, cities and communities taking urgent and sustained locally-appropriate action to mitigate 
GHG emissions and adapt to SLR.
