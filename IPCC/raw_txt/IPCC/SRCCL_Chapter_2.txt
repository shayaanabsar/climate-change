Chapter 2

Executive summary
Land and climate interact in complex ways through changes in 
forcing and multiple biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks 
across different spatial and temporal scales. This chapter assesses 
climate impacts on land and land impacts on climate, the human 
contributions to these changes, as well as land-based adaptation and 
mitigation response options to combat projected climate changes.
Implications of climate change, variability 
and extremes for land systems
It is certain that globally averaged land surface air 
temperature (LSAT) has risen faster than the global mean 
surface temperature (i.e., combined LSAT and sea surface 
temperature) from the preindustrial period (1850–1900) to 
the present day (1999–2018). According to the single longest 
and most extensive dataset, from 1850–1900 to 2006–2015 
mean land surface air temperature has increased by 1.53°C 
(very likely range from 1.38°C to 1.68°C) while global mean 
surface temperature has increased by 0.87°C (likely range 
from 0.75°C to 0.99°C). For the 1880–2018 period, when four 
independently produced datasets exist, the LSAT increase 
was 1.41°C (1.31–1.51°C), where the range represents the 
spread in the datasets’ median estimates. Analyses of paleo 
records, historical observations, model simulations and underlying 
physical principles are all in agreement that LSATs are increasing 
at a higher rate than SST as a result of differences in evaporation, 
land–climate feedbacks and changes in the aerosol forcing over land 
(very high confidence). For the 2000–2016 period, the land-to-ocean 
warming ratio (about 1.6) is in close agreement between different 
observational records and the CMIP5 climate model simulations 
(the likely range of 1.54–1.81). {2.2.1}
Anthropogenic warming has resulted in shifts of climate zones, 
primarily as an increase in dry climates and decrease of polar 
climates (high confidence). Ongoing warming is projected to 
result in new, hot climates in tropical regions and to shift climate 
zones poleward in the mid- to high latitudes and upward in 
regions of higher elevation (high confidence). Ecosystems in these 
regions will become increasingly exposed to temperature and rainfall 
extremes beyonwd the climate regimes they are currently adapted 
to (high confidence), which can alter their structure, composition 
and functioning. Additionally, high-latitude warming is projected to 
accelerate permafrost thawing and increase disturbance in boreal 
forests through abiotic (e.g., drought, fire) and biotic (e.g.,  pests, 
disease) agents (high confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.5.3}
Globally, greening trends (trends of increased photosynthetic 
activity in vegetation) have increased over the last 2–3 decades 
by 22–33%, particularly over China, India, many parts of 
Europe, central North America, southeast Brazil and southeast 
Australia (high confidence). This results from a combination 
of direct (i.e., land use and management, forest conservation and 
expansion) and indirect factors (i.e., CO2 fertilisation, extended 
growing season, global warming, nitrogen deposition, increase 
of diffuse radiation) linked to human activities (high confidence). 
Browning trends (trends of decreasing photosynthetic activity) are 
projected in many regions where increases in drought and heatwaves 
are projected in a warmer climate. There is low confidence in the 
projections of global greening and browning trends. {2.2.4, Cross-
Chapter Box 4 in this chapter}
The frequency and intensity of some extreme weather and 
climate events have increased as a consequence of global 
warming and will continue to increase under medium and high 
emission scenarios (high confidence). Recent heat-related events, 
for example, heatwaves, have been made more frequent or intense 
due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in most land 
regions and the frequency and intensity of drought has increased in 
Amazonia, north-eastern Brazil, the Mediterranean, Patagonia, most 
of Africa and north-eastern China (medium confidence). Heatwaves 
are projected to increase in frequency, intensity and duration in most 
parts of the world (high confidence) and drought frequency and 
intensity is projected to increase in some regions that are already 
drought prone, predominantly in the Mediterranean, central Europe, 
the southern Amazon and southern Africa (medium confidence). 
These changes will impact ecosystems, food security and land 
processes including GHG fluxes (high confidence). {2.2.5}
Climate change is playing an increasing role in determining 
wildfire 
regimes 
alongside 
human 
activity 
(medium 
confidence), with future climate variability expected to 
enhance the risk and severity of wildfires in many biomes such 
as tropical rainforests (high confidence). Fire weather seasons 
have lengthened globally between 1979 and 2013 (low confidence). 
Global land area burned has declined in recent decades, mainly 
due to less burning in grasslands and savannahs (high confidence). 
While drought remains the dominant driver of fire emissions, 
there has recently been increased fire activity in some tropical and 
temperate regions during normal to wetter than average years 
due to warmer temperatures that increase vegetation flammability 
(medium confidence). The boreal zone is also experiencing larger and 
more frequent fires, and this may increase under a warmer climate 
(medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in this chapter}
Terrestrial greenhouse gas fluxes on unmanaged 
and managed lands
Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) is a significant 
net source of GHG emissions (high confidence), contributing 
to about 23% of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) combined as CO2 
equivalents in 2007–2016 (medium confidence). AFOLU results in 
both emissions and removals of CO2, CH4 and N2O to and from the 
atmosphere (high confidence). These fluxes are affected simultaneously 
by natural and human drivers, making it difficult to separate natural 
from anthropogenic fluxes (very high confidence). {2.3}
The total net land-atmosphere flux of CO2 on both managed 
and unmanaged lands very likely provided a global net removal 
from 2007 to 2016 according to models (-6.0 ± 3.7 GtCO2 yr–1, 
134
Chapter 2 
Land–climate interactions

likely range). This net removal is comprised of two major 
components: (i) modelled net anthropogenic emissions from AFOLU 
are 5.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely range) driven by land cover change, 
including deforestation and afforestation/reforestation, and wood 
harvesting (accounting for about 13% of total net anthropogenic 
emissions of CO2) (medium confidence), and (ii) modelled net removals 
due to non-anthropogenic processes are 11.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely 
range) on managed and unmanaged lands, driven by environmental 
changes such as increasing CO2, nitrogen deposition and changes in 
climate (accounting for a removal of 29% of the CO2 emitted from 
all anthropogenic activities (fossil fuel, industry and AFOLU) (medium 
confidence). {2.3.1}
Global models and national GHG inventories use different 
methods to estimate anthropogenic CO2 emissions and 
removals for the land sector. Consideration of differences 
in methods can enhance understanding of land sector net 
emission such as under the Paris Agreement’s global stocktake 
(medium confidence). Both models and inventories produce 
estimates that are in close agreement for land-use change involving 
forest (e.g., deforestation, afforestation), and differ for managed 
forest. Global models consider as managed forest those lands that 
were subject to harvest whereas, consistent with IPCC guidelines, 
national GHG inventories define managed forest more broadly. On 
this larger area, inventories can also consider the natural response 
of land to human-induced environmental changes as anthropogenic, 
while the global model approach {Table SPM.1} treats this response 
as part of the non-anthropogenic sink. For illustration, from 2005 to 
2014, the sum of the national GHG inventories net emission estimates 
is 0.1 ± 1.0 GtCO2 yr–1, while the mean of two global bookkeeping 
models is 5.1 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely range). 
The gross emissions from AFOLU (one-third of total global 
emissions) are more indicative of mitigation potential 
of reduced deforestation than the global net emissions 
(13% of total global emissions), which include compensating 
deforestation and afforestation fluxes (high confidence). The 
net flux of CO2 from AFOLU is composed of two opposing gross fluxes: 
(i) gross emissions (20 GtCO2 yr–1) from deforestation, cultivation 
of soils and oxidation of wood products, and (ii) gross removals 
(–14 GtCO2 yr–1), largely from forest growth following wood harvest 
and agricultural abandonment (medium confidence). {2.3.1}
Land is a net source of CH4, accounting for 44% of anthropogenic 
CH4 emissions for the 2006–2017 period (medium confidence). 
The pause in the rise of atmospheric CH4 concentrations between 
2000 and 2006 and the subsequent renewed increase appear to be 
partially associated with land use and land use change. The recent 
depletion trend of the 13C isotope in the atmosphere indicates that 
higher biogenic sources explain part of the current CH4 increase and 
that biogenic sources make up a larger proportion of the source 
mix than they did before 2000 (high confidence). In agreement 
with the findings of AR5, tropical wetlands and peatlands continue 
to be important drivers of inter-annual variability and current CH4 
concentration increases (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Ruminants and the expansion of rice cultivation are also important 
contributors to the current trend (medium evidence, high agreement). 
There is significant and ongoing accumulation of CH4 in the 
atmosphere (very high confidence). {2.3.2}
AFOLU is the main anthropogenic source of N2O primarily due 
to nitrogen application to soils (high confidence). In croplands, 
the main driver of N2O emissions is a lack of synchronisation between 
crop nitrogen demand and soil nitrogen supply, with approximately 
50% of the nitrogen applied to agricultural land not taken up by the 
crop. Cropland soils emit over 3 MtN2O-N yr–1 (medium confidence). 
Because the response of N2O emissions to fertiliser application rates 
is non-linear, in regions of the world where low nitrogen application 
rates dominate, such as sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Eastern 
Europe, increases in nitrogen fertiliser use would generate relatively 
small increases in agricultural N2O emissions. Decreases in application 
rates in regions where application rates are high and exceed crop 
demand for parts of the growing season will have very large effects 
on emissions reductions (medium evidence, high agreement). {2.3.3}
While managed pastures make up only one-quarter of grazing 
lands, they contributed more than three-quarters of N2O 
emissions from grazing lands between 1961 and 2014 
with rapid recent increases of nitrogen inputs resulting 
in disproportionate growth in emissions from these lands 
(medium confidence). Grazing lands (pastures and rangelands) 
are responsible for more than one-third of total anthropogenic N2O 
emissions or more than one-half of agricultural emissions (high 
confidence). Emissions are largely from North America, Europe, 
East Asia, and South Asia, but hotspots are shifting from Europe to 
southern Asia (medium confidence). {2.3.3}
Increased emissions from vegetation and soils due to climate 
change in the future are expected to counteract potential 
sinks due to CO2 fertilisation (low confidence). Responses of 
vegetation and soil organic carbon (SOC) to rising atmospheric 
CO2 concentration and climate change are not well constrained 
by observations (medium confidence). Nutrient (e.g.,  nitrogen, 
phosphorus) availability can limit future plant growth and carbon 
storage under rising CO2 (high confidence). However, new evidence 
suggests that ecosystem adaptation through plant-microbe 
symbioses could alleviate some nitrogen limitation (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Warming of soils and increased litter 
inputs will accelerate carbon losses through microbial respiration 
(high confidence). Thawing of high latitude/altitude permafrost will 
increase rates of SOC loss and change the balance between CO2 and 
CH4 emissions (medium confidence). The balance between increased 
respiration in warmer climates and carbon uptake from enhanced 
plant growth is a key uncertainty for the size of the future land 
carbon sink (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.7.2, Box 2.3}
Biophysical and biogeochemical land forcing 
and feedbacks to the climate system 
Changes in land conditions from human use or climate change 
in turn affect regional and global climate (high confidence). On 
the global scale, this is driven by changes in emissions or removals of 
CO2, CH4 and N2O by land (biogeochemical effects) and by changes 
135
Land–climate interactions  
Chapter 2

in the surface albedo (very high confidence). Any local land changes 
that redistribute energy and water vapour between the land and 
the atmosphere influence regional climate (biophysical effects; 
high confidence). However, there is no confidence in whether such 
biophysical effects influence global climate. {2.1, 2.3, 2.5.1, 2.5.2} 
Changes in land conditions modulate the likelihood, intensity 
and duration of many extreme events including heatwaves 
(high confidence) and heavy precipitation events (medium 
confidence). Dry soil conditions favour or strengthen summer 
heatwave conditions through reduced evapotranspiration and 
increased sensible heat. By contrast wet soil conditions, for example 
from irrigation or crop management practices that maintain a cover 
crop all year round, can dampen extreme warm events through 
increased evapotranspiration and reduced sensible heat. Droughts 
can be intensified by poor land management. Urbanisation increases 
extreme rainfall events over or downwind of cities (medium 
confidence). {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3} 
Historical changes in anthropogenic land cover have resulted 
in a mean annual global warming of surface air from 
biogeochemical effects (very high confidence), dampened 
by a cooling from biophysical effects (medium confidence). 
Biogeochemical warming results from increased emissions of GHGs 
by land, with model-based estimates of +0.20 ± 0.05°C (global 
climate models) and +0.24 ± 0.12°C – dynamic global vegetation 
models (DGVMs) as well as an observation-based estimate of +0.25 
± 0.10°C. A net biophysical cooling of –0.10 ± 0.14°C has been 
derived from global climate models in response to the increased 
surface albedo and decreased turbulent heat fluxes, but it is smaller 
than the warming effect from land-based emissions. However, when 
both biogeochemical and biophysical effects are accounted for 
within the same global climate model, the models do not agree on 
the sign of the net change in mean annual surface air temperature. 
{2.3, 2.5.1, Box 2.1}
The future projected changes in anthropogenic land cover that 
have been examined for AR5 would result in a biogeochemical 
warming and a biophysical cooling whose magnitudes depend 
on the scenario (high confidence). Biogeochemical warming has 
been projected for RCP8.5 by both global climate models (+0.20 ± 
0.15°C) and DGVMs (+0.28 ± 0.11°C) (high confidence). A global 
biophysical cooling of 0.10 ± 0.14°C is estimated from global climate 
models and is projected to dampen the land-based warming (low 
confidence). For RCP4.5, the biogeochemical warming estimated 
from global climate models (+0.12 ± 0.17°C) is stronger than the 
warming estimated by DGVMs (+0.01 ± 0.04°C) but based on limited 
evidence, as is the biophysical cooling (–0.10 ± 0.21°C). {2.5.2}
Regional climate change can be dampened or enhanced by 
changes in local land cover and land use (high confidence) 
but this depends on the location and the season (high 
confidence). In boreal regions, for example, where projected climate 
change will migrate the treeline northward, increase the growing 
season length and thaw permafrost, regional winter warming will 
be enhanced by decreased surface albedo and snow, whereas 
warming will be dampened during the growing season due to larger 
evapotranspiration (high confidence). In the tropics, wherever climate 
change will increase rainfall, vegetation growth and associated 
increase in evapotranspiration will result in a dampening effect on 
regional warming (medium confidence). {2.5.2, 2.5.3} 
According to model-based studies, changes in local land 
cover or available water from irrigation will affect climate in 
regions as far as few hundreds of kilometres downwind (high 
confidence). The local redistribution of water and energy following 
the changes on land affect the horizontal and vertical gradients of 
temperature, pressure and moisture, thus altering regional winds and 
consequently moisture and temperature advection and convection 
and subsequently, precipitation. {2.5.2, 2.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 4} 
Future increases in both climate change and urbanisation will 
enhance warming in cities and their surroundings (urban heat 
island), especially during heatwaves (high confidence). Urban 
and peri-urban agriculture, and more generally urban greening, 
can contribute to mitigation (medium confidence) as well as to 
adaptation (high confidence), with co-benefits for food security and 
reduced soil-water-air pollution. {Cross-Chapter Box 4}
Regional climate is strongly affected by natural land aerosols 
(medium confidence) (e.g., mineral dust, black, brown and 
organic carbon), but there is low confidence in historical 
trends, inter-annual and decadal variability and future 
changes. Forest cover affects climate through emissions of biogenic 
volatile organic compounds (BVOC) and aerosols (low confidence). 
The decrease in the emissions of BVOC resulting from the historical 
conversion of forests to cropland has resulted in a positive radiative 
forcing through direct and indirect aerosol effects, a negative 
radiative forcing through the reduction in the atmospheric lifetime of 
methane and it has contributed to increased ozone concentrations in 
different regions (low confidence). {2.4, 2.5}
Consequences for the climate system of land-based 
adaptation and mitigation options, including carbon 
dioxide removal (negative emissions) 
About one-quarter of the 2030 mitigation pledged by countries 
in their initial nationally determined contributions (NDCs) 
under the Paris Agreement is expected to come from land-
based mitigation options (medium confidence). Most of the 
NDCs submitted by countries include land-based mitigation, although 
many lack details. Several refer explicitly to reduced deforestation 
and forest sinks, while a few include soil carbon sequestration, 
agricultural management and bioenergy. Full implementation of 
NDCs (submitted by February 2016) is expected to result in net 
removals of 0.4–1.3 GtCO2 y–1 in 2030 compared to the net flux in 
2010, where the range represents low to high mitigation ambition in 
pledges, not uncertainty in estimates (medium confidence). {2.6.3}
Several mitigation response options have technical potential 
for >3 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050 through reduced emissions and 
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) (high confidence), some of 
which compete for land and other resources, while others may 
136
Chapter 2

reduce the demand for land (high confidence). Estimates of the 
technical potential of individual response options are not necessarily 
additive. The largest potential for reducing AFOLU emissions are 
through reduced deforestation and forest degradation (0.4–5.8 
GtCO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence), a shift towards plant-based 
diets (0.7–8.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence) and reduced food 
and agricultural waste (0.8–4.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence). 
Agriculture measures combined could mitigate 0.3–3.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(medium confidence). The options with largest potential for CDR 
are afforestation/reforestation (0.5–10.1 GtCO2-eq yr–1) (medium 
confidence), soil carbon sequestration in croplands and grasslands 
(0.4–8.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1) (high confidence) and Bioenergy with 
Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) (0.4–11.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1) 
(medium confidence). While some estimates include sustainability 
and cost considerations, most do not include socio-economic barriers, 
the impacts of future climate change or non-GHG climate forcings. 
{2.6.1}
Response options intended to mitigate global warming 
will also affect the climate locally and regionally through 
biophysical effects (high confidence). Expansion of forest area, 
for example, typically removes CO2 from the atmosphere and thus 
dampens global warming (biogeochemical effect, high confidence), 
but the biophysical effects can dampen or enhance regional warming 
depending on location, season and time of day. During the growing 
season, afforestation generally brings cooler days from increased 
evapotranspiration, and warmer nights (high confidence). During 
the dormant season, forests are warmer than any other land cover, 
especially in snow-covered areas where forest cover reduces albedo 
(high confidence). At the global level, the temperature effects of 
boreal afforestation/reforestation run counter to GHG effects, while 
in the tropics they enhance GHG effects. In addition, trees locally 
dampen the amplitude of heat extremes (medium confidence). 
{2.5.2, 2.5.4, 2.7, Cross-Chapter Box 4}
Mitigation response options related to land use are a key 
element of most modelled scenarios that provide strong 
mitigation, alongside emissions reduction in other sectors 
(high confidence). More stringent climate targets rely more 
heavily on land-based mitigation options, in particular, CDR 
(high confidence). Across a range of scenarios in 2100, CDR is 
delivered by both afforestation (median values of –1.3, –1.7 and –2.4 
GtCO2 yr–1 for scenarios RCP4.5, RCP2.6 and RCP1.9 respectively) 
and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (–6.5, –11 
and –14.9 GtCO2 yr–1 respectively). Emissions of CH4 and N2O are 
reduced through improved agricultural and livestock management as 
well as dietary shifts away from emission-intensive livestock products 
by 133.2, 108.4 and 73.5 MtCH4 yr–1; and 7.4, 6.1 and 4.5 MtN2O yr–1 
for the same set of scenarios in 2100 (high confidence). High levels 
of bioenergy crop production can result in increased N2O emissions 
due to fertiliser use. The Integrated Assessment Models that produce 
these scenarios mostly neglect the biophysical effects of land-use on 
global and regional warming. {2.5, 2.6.2}
Large-scale implementation of mitigation response options 
that limit warming to 1.5°C or 2°C would require conversion 
of large areas of land for afforestation/reforestation and 
bioenergy crops, which could lead to short-term carbon losses 
(high confidence). The change of global forest area in mitigation 
pathways ranges from about –0.2 to +7.2 Mkm2 between 2010 
and 2100 (median values across a range of models and scenarios: 
RCP4.5, RCP2.6, RCP1.9), and the land demand for bioenergy crops 
ranges from about 3.2 to 6.6 Mkm2 in 2100 (high confidence). Large-
scale land-based CDR is associated with multiple feasibility and 
sustainability constraints (Chapters 6 and 7). In high carbon lands 
such as forests and peatlands, the carbon benefits of land protection 
are greater in the short-term than converting land to bioenergy crops 
for BECCS, which can take several harvest cycles to ‘pay-back’ the 
carbon emitted during conversion (carbon-debt), from decades to 
over a century (medium confidence). {2.6.2, Chapters 6, 7}
It is possible to achieve climate change targets with low need 
for land-demanding CDR such as BECCS, but such scenarios 
rely more on rapidly reduced emissions or CDR from forests, 
agriculture and other sectors. Terrestrial CDR has the technical 
potential to balance emissions that are difficult to eliminate 
with current technologies (including food production). Scenarios 
that achieve climate change targets with less need for terrestrial 
CDR rely on agricultural demand-side changes (diet change, 
waste reduction), and changes in agricultural production such as 
agricultural intensification. Such pathways that minimise land use for 
bioenergy and BECCS are characterised by rapid and early reduction 
of GHG emissions in all sectors, as well as earlier CDR in through 
afforestation. In contrast, delayed mitigation action would increase 
reliance on land-based CDR (high confidence). {2.6.2}

2.1 
Introduction: Land–climate interactions 
This chapter assesses the literature on two-way interactions between 
climate and land, with focus on scientific findings published since 
AR5 and some aspects of the land–climate interactions that were 
not assessed in previous IPCC reports. Previous IPCC assessments 
recognised that climate affects land cover and land surface processes, 
which in turn affect climate. However, previous assessments mostly 
focused on the contribution of land to global climate change via 
its role in emitting and absorbing greenhouse gases (GHGs) and 
short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), or via implications of changes 
in surface reflective properties (i.e., albedo) for solar radiation 
absorbed by the surface. This chapter examines scientific advances in 
understanding the interactive changes of climate and land, including 
impacts of climate change, variability and extremes on managed and 
unmanaged lands. It assesses climate forcing of land changes from 
direct (e.g.,  land use change and land management) and indirect 
(e.g.,  increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration and nitrogen 
deposition) effects at local, regional and global scales.
2.1.1 
Recap of previous IPCC and other relevant 
reports as baselines
The evidence that land cover matters for the climate system have 
long been known, especially from early paleoclimate modelling 
studies and impacts of human-induced deforestation at the margin 
of deserts (de Noblet et  al. 1996; Kageyama et  al. 2004). The 
understanding of how land use activities impact climate has been put 
forward by the pioneering work of Charney (1975) who examined the 
role of overgrazing-induced desertification on the Sahelian climate. 
Since then there have been many modelling studies that reported 
impacts of idealised or simplified land cover changes on weather 
patterns (e.g., Pielke et al. 2011). The number of studies dealing with 
such issues has increased significantly over the past 10 years, with 
more studies that address realistic past or projected land changes. 
However, very few studies have addressed the impacts of land cover 
changes on climate as very few land surface models embedded within 
climate models (whether global or regional), include a representation 
of land management. Observation-based evidence of land-induced 
climate impacts emerged even more recently (e.g.,  Alkama and 
Cescatti 2016; Bright et  al. 2017; Lee et  al.  2011; Li  et  al. 2015; 
Duveiller  et  al. 2018; Forzieri et  al. 2017) and the literature is 
therefore limited.
In previous IPCC reports, the interactions between climate change 
and land were covered separately by three working groups. AR5 WGI 
assessed the role of land use change in radiative forcing, land-based 
GHGs source and sink, and water cycle changes that focused on 
changes of evapotranspiration, snow and ice, runoff and humidity. 
AR5 WGII examined impacts of climate change on land, including 
terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, managed ecosystems, and 
cities and settlements. AR5 WGIII assessed land-based climate 
change mitigation goals and pathways related to the agriculture, 
forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Here, this chapter assesses 
land–climate interactions from all three working groups. It also 
builds on previous special reports such as the Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15). It links to the IPCC Guidelines on 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories in the land sector. Importantly, 
this chapter assesses knowledge that has never been reported in any 
of those previous reports. Finally, the chapter also tries to reconcile 
the possible inconsistencies across the various IPCC reports.
Land-based water cycle changes
AR5 reported an increase in global evapotranspiration from the 
early 1980s to 2000s, but a constraint on further increases from low 
soil moisture availability. Rising CO2 concentration limits stomatal 
opening and thus also reduces transpiration, a component of 
evapotranspiration. Increasing aerosol levels, declining surface wind 
speeds and declining levels of solar radiation reaching the ground 
are additional regional causes of the decrease in evapotranspiration. 
Land area precipitation change
Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the northern 
hemisphere, precipitation has increased since 1901 (medium 
confidence before 1951 and high confidence thereafter). For other 
latitudes, area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends 
have low confidence. There are likely more land regions where the 
number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it 
has decreased. Extreme precipitation events over most of the mid-
latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely 
become more intense and more frequent (IPCC 2013a).
Land-based GHGs
AR5 reported that annual net CO2 emissions from anthropogenic 
land use change were 0.9 [0.1–1.7] GtC yr–1 on average during 
2002–2011 (medium confidence). From 1750–2011, CO2 emissions 
from fossil fuel combustion have released an estimated 375 
[345–405] GtC to the atmosphere, while deforestation and other 
land use change have released an estimated 180 [100–260] GtC. 
Of these cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions, 240 [230–250] 
GtC have accumulated in the atmosphere, 155 [125–185] GtC have 
been taken up by the ocean and 160 [70–250] GtC have accumulated 
in terrestrial ecosystems (i.e., the cumulative residual land sink) 
(Ciais et al. 2013a). Updated assessment and knowledge gaps are 
covered in Section 2.3.
Future terrestrial carbon source/sink
AR5 projected with high confidence that tropical ecosystems 
will uptake less carbon and with medium confidence that at high 
latitudes, land carbon sink will increase in a warmer climate. Thawing 
permafrost in the high latitudes is potentially a large carbon source 
in warmer climate conditions, however the magnitude of CO2 and 
CH4 emissions due to permafrost thawing is still uncertain. The SR15 
further indicates that constraining warming to 1.5°C would prevent 
the melting of an estimated permafrost area of 2 million km2 over the 
next centuries compared to 2°C. Updates to these assessments are 
found in Section 2.3.

Land use change altered albedo
AR5 stated with high confidence that anthropogenic land use 
change has increased the land surface albedo, which has led to 
a RF of –0.15 ± 0.10 W m–2. However, it also underlined that the 
sources of the large spread across independent estimates were 
caused by differences in assumptions for the albedo of natural and 
managed surfaces and for the fraction of land use change before 
1750. Generally, our understanding of albedo changes from land use 
change has been enhanced from AR4 to AR5, with a narrower range 
of estimates and a higher confidence level. The radiative forcing from 
changes in albedo induced by land use changes was estimated in 
AR5 at–0.15 W m–2 (–0.25 to about –0.05), with medium confidence 
in AR5 (Myhre et al. 2013). This was an improvement over AR4 in 
which it was estimated at –0.2 W m–2 (–0.4 to about 0), with low 
to medium confidence (Forster et al. 2007). Section 2.5 shows that 
albedo is not the only source of biophysical land-based climate 
forcing to be considered.
Hydrological feedback to climate
Land use changes also affect surface temperatures through non-
radiative processes, and particularly through the hydrological cycle. 
These processes are less well known and are difficult to quantify 
but tend to offset the impact of albedo changes. As a consequence, 
there is low agreement on the sign of the net change in global mean 
temperature as a result of land use change (Hartmann et al. 2013a). 
An updated assessment on these points is covered in Sections 2.5 
and 2.2.
Climate-related extremes on land
AR5 reported that impacts from recent climate-related extremes 
reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems to 
current climate variability. Impacts of such climate-related extremes 
include alteration of ecosystems, disruption of food production and 
water supply, damage to infrastructure and settlements, morbidity 
and mortality, and consequences for mental health and human well-
being (Burkett et al. 2014). The SR15 further indicates that limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C limits the risks of increases in heavy 
precipitation events in several regions (high confidence). In urban 
areas, climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, 
economies and ecosystems (very high confidence). These risks are 
amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or 
living in exposed areas. An updated assessment and a knowledge gap 
for this chapter are covered in Section 2.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 4.
Land-based climate change adaptation and mitigation
AR5 reported that adaptation and mitigation choices in the near-
term will affect the risks related to climate change throughout the 
21st century (Burkett et al. 2014). AFOLU are responsible for about 
10–12 GtCO2eq yr–1 anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, 
mainly from deforestation and agricultural production. Global CO2 
emissions from forestry and other land use have declined since AR4, 
largely due to increased afforestation. The SR15 further indicates 
that afforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS) are important land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
options. It also states that land use and land-use change emerge as a 
critical feature of virtually all mitigation pathways that seek to limit 
global warming to 1.5oC. The Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report 
concluded that co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation 
could affect achievement of other objectives, such as those related to 
human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, 
energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development. 
Updated assessment and knowledge gaps are covered in Section 2.6 
and Chapter 7.
Overall, sustainable land management is largely  constrained  by 
climate change and extremes, but also puts bounds on the capacity 
of land to effectively adapt to climate change and mitigate its 
impacts. Scientific knowledge has advanced on how to optimise our 
adaptation and mitigation efforts while coordinating sustainable land 
management across sectors and stakeholders. Details are assessed in 
subsequent sections.
2.1.2 
Introduction to the chapter structure
This chapter assesses the consequences of changes in land cover 
and functioning, resulting from both land use and climate change, to 
global and regional climates. The chapter starts with an assessment 
of the historical and projected responses of land processes to climate 
change and extremes (Section 2.2). Subsequently, the chapter assesses 
historical and future changes in terrestrial GHG fluxes (Section 2.3) 
as well as non-GHG fluxes and precursors of SLCFs (Section 2.4). 
Section  2.5 focuses on how historical and future changes in land 
use and land cover influence climate change/variability through 
biophysical and biogeochemical forcing and feedbacks, how specific 
land management affects climate, and how, in turn, climate-
induced land changes feed back to climate. Section 2.6 assesses 
the consequences of land-based adaptation and mitigation options 
for the climate system in GHG and non-GHG exchanges. Sections 
2.3 and 2.6 address implications of the Paris Agreement for land–
climate interactions, and the scientific evidence base for ongoing 
negotiations around the Paris rulebook, the global stocktake and 
credibility in measuring, reporting and verifying the climate impacts 
of anthropogenic activities on land. This chapter also examines how 
land use and management practices may affect climate change 
through biophysical feedbacks and radiative forcing (Section 2.5), and 
assesses policy-relevant projected land use changes and sustainable 
land management for mitigation and adaptation (Section 2.6). 
Finally, the chapter concludes with a brief assessment of advances 
in the understanding of the ecological and biogeochemical processes 
underlying land–climate interactions (Section 2.7).
The chapter includes three chapter boxes providing general overview 
of (i) processes underlying land–climate interactions (Box 2.1), 
(ii)  methodological approaches for estimating anthropogenic land 
carbon fluxes from national to global scales (Box 2.2), and (iii) CO2 
fertilisation and enhanced terrestrial uptake of carbon (Box 2.3). In 
addition, this chapter includes two cross-chapter boxes on climate 
change and fire (Cross-Chapter Box 3), and on urbanisation and 
climate change (Cross-Chapter Box 4).

In summary, the chapter assesses scientifi c understanding related to 
(i) how a changing climate affects terrestrial ecosystems, including 
those on managed lands, (ii) how land affects climate through 
biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks, and (iii) how land use or 
cover change and land management play an important and complex 
role in the climate system. This chapter also pays special attention to 
advances in understanding cross-scale interactions, emerging issues, 
heterogeneity and teleconnections.
B ox 2.1 |  Processes underlying land–climate interactions 
Land continuously interacts with the atmosphere through exchanges of, for instance, GHGs (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O), water, energy 
or precursors of short lived-climate forcers (e.g., biogenic volatile organic compounds, dust, black carbon). The terrestrial biosphere 
also interacts with oceans through processes such as the infl ux of freshwater, nutrients, carbon and particles. These interactions 
affect where and when rain falls and thus irrigation needs for crops, frequency and intensity of heatwaves, and air quality. They are 
modifi ed by global and regional climate change, decadal, inter-annual and seasonal climatic variations, and weather extremes, as 
well as human actions on land (e.g., crop and forest management, afforestation and deforestation). This in turn affects atmospheric 
composition, surface temperature, hydrological cycle and thus local, regional and global climate. This box introduces some of the 
fundamental land processes governing biophysical and biogeochemical effects and feedbacks to the climate (Box 2.1, Figure 1).
B ox 2.1, Figure 1 |  The structure and functioning of managed and unmanaged ecosystems that affect local, regional and global climate. Land 
surface characteristics such as albedo and emissivity determine the amount of solar and long-wave radiation absorbed by land and refl ected or emitted to the 
atmosphere. Surface roughness infl uences turbulent exchanges of momentum, energy, water and biogeochemical tracers. Land ecosystems modulate the atmospheric 
composition through emissions and removals of many GHGs and precursors of SLCFs, including biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and mineral dust. 
Atmospheric aerosols formed from these precursors affect regional climate by altering the amounts of precipitation and radiation reaching land surfaces through their 
role in clouds physics.
‘Biophysical interactions’ are exchanges of water and energy between the land and the atmosphere (Section 2.5). Land warms up 
from absorbing solar and long-wave radiation; it cools down through transfers of sensible heat (via conduction and convection) and 
latent heat (energy associated with water evapotranspiration) to the atmosphere and through long-wave radiation emission from 
the land surface (Box 2.1, Figure 1). These interactions between the land and the atmosphere depend on land surface characteristics, 
including refl ectivity of shortwave radiation (albedo), emissivity of long wave radiation by vegetation and soils, surface roughness 
and soil water access by vegetation, which depends on both soil characteristics and amounts of roots. Over seasonal, inter-annual 
and decadal timescales, these characteristics vary among different land cover and land-use types and are affected by both natural 
processes and land management (Anderson et al. 2011). A dense vegetation with high leaf area index, like forests, may absorb more 
energy than nearby herbaceous vegetation partly due to differences in surface albedo (especially when snow is on the ground). 
However, denser vegetation also sends more energy back to the atmosphere in the form of evapotranspiration (Bonan, 2008; 
Burakowski et al., 2018; Ellison et al., 2017) (Section 2.5.2) and this contributes to changes in atmospheric water vapour content, and 
subsequently to changes in rainfall. 
Particularly in extra-tropical regions, these characteristics exhibit strong seasonal patterns with the development and senescence of the 
vegetation (e.g., leaf colour change and drop). For example, in deciduous forests, seasonal growth increases albedo by 20–50% from the 
spring minima to growing season maxima, followed by rapid decrease during leaf fall, whereas in grasslands, spring greening causes 
albedo decreases and only increases with vegetation browning (Hollinger et al. 2010). The seasonal patterns of sensible and latent heat 
fl uxes are also driven by the cycle of leaf development and senescence in temperate deciduous forests: sensible heat fl uxes peak in spring 
and autumn and latent heat fl uxes peak in mid-summer (Moore et al. 1996; Richardson et al. 2013).

Land–climate interactions

Box 2.1 (continued)
Exchanges of GHGs between the land and the atmosphere are referred to as ‘biogeochemical interactions’ (Section 2.3), which 
are driven mainly by the balance between photosynthesis and respiration by plants, and by the decomposition of soil organic matter by 
microbes. The conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic compounds by plant photosynthesis, known as terrestrial net 
primary productivity, is the source of plant growth, food for human and other organisms, and soil organic carbon. Due to strong 
seasonal patterns of growth, northern hemisphere terrestrial ecosystems are largely responsible for the seasonal variations in global 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In addition to CO2, soils emit methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Section 2.3). Soil temperature 
and moisture strongly affect microbial activities and resulting fluxes of these three GHGs.
Much like fossil fuel emissions, GHG emissions from anthropogenic land cover change and land management are ‘forcers’ on 
the climate system. Other land-based changes to climate are described as ‘feedbacks’ to the climate system – a process by which 
climate change influences some property of land, which in turn diminishes (negative feedback) or amplifies (positive feedback) 
climate change. Examples of feedbacks include the changes in the strength of land carbon sinks or sources, soil moisture and 
plant phenology (Section 2.5.3). 
Incorporating these land–climate processes into climate projections allows for increased understanding of the land’s response 
to climate change (Section 2.2), and to better quantify the potential of land-based response options for climate change mitigation 
(Section 2.6). However, to date Earth system models (ESMs) incorporate some combined biophysical and biogeochemical processes 
only to limited extent and many relevant processes about how plants and soils interactively respond to climate changes are still 
to be included (Section 2.7). And even within this class of models, the spread in ESM projections is large, in part because of their 
varying ability to represent land–climate processes (Hoffman et al. 2014). Significant progress in understanding of these processes 
has nevertheless been made since AR5.
2.2 
The effect of climate variability 
and change on land
2.2.1 
Overview of climate impacts on land
2.2.1.1 
Climate drivers of land form and function
Energy is redistributed from the warm equator to the colder 
poles through large-scale atmospheric and oceanic processes 
driving the Earth’s weather and climate (Oort and Peixóto 1983; 
Carissimo et al. 1985; Yang et al. 2015a). Subsequently, a number of 
global climate zones have been classified ranging from large-scale 
primary climate zones (tropical, sub-tropical, temperate, sub-polar, 
polar) to much higher-resolution, regional climate zones (e.g.,  the 
Köppen-Geiger classification, Kottek et al. 2006). Biomes are adapted 
to regional climates (Figure 2.1) and may shift as climate, land surface 
characteristics (e.g., geomorphology, hydrology), CO2 fertilisation and 
fire interact. These biomes and the processes therein are subject to 
modes of natural variability in the ocean-atmosphere system that result 
in regionally wetter/dryer or hotter/cooler periods having temporal 
scales from weeks to months (e.g., Southern Annular Mode), months to 
seasons (e.g., Madden-Julian Oscillation), years (e.g., El Niño Southern 
Oscillation) and decades (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Furthermore, 
climate and weather extremes (such as drought, heatwaves, very heavy 
rainfall, strong winds), whose frequency, intensity and duration are 
often a function of large-scale modes of variability, impact ecosystems 
at various space and timescales. 
It is very likely that changes to natural climate variability as a result of 
global warming has and will continue to impact terrestrial ecosystems 
with subsequent impacts on land processes (Hulme  et  al.  1999; 
Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Di Lorenzo et al. 2008; Kløve et al. 2014; 
Berg et al. 2015; Lemordant et al. 2016; Pecl et al. 2017). This chapter 
assesses climate variability and change, particularly extreme weather 
and climate, in the context of desertification, land degradation, food 
security and terrestrial ecosystems more generally. This section does 
specifically assess the impacts of climate variability and climate 
change on desertification, land degradation and food security as 
these impacts are assessed respectively in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. This 
chapter begins with an assessment of observed warming on land.
2.2.1.2 
Changes in global land surface air temperature
Based on analysis of several global and regional land surface air 
temperature (LSAT) datasets, AR5 concluded that the global LSAT had 
increased over the instrumental period of record, with the warming 
rate approximately double that reported over the oceans since 1979 
and that ‘it is certain that globally averaged LSAT has risen since the 
late 19th century and that this warming has been particularly marked 
since the 1970s’. Warming found in the global land datasets is also in 
a broad agreement with station observations (Hartmann et al. 2013a).
Since AR5, LSAT datasets have been improved and extended. The 
National Center for Environmental Information, which is a part of the US 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), developed 
a new, fourth version of the Global Historical Climatology Network 
monthly dataset (GHCNm, v4). The dataset provides an expanded set 
of station temperature records with more than 25,000 total monthly 
temperature stations compared to 7200 in versions v2 and v3 (Menne 
et al. 2018). Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is a part of 
141
Land–climate interactions

the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration, (NASA/
GISS), provides estimate of land and ocean temperature anomalies 
(GISTEMP). The GISTEMP land temperature anomalies are based upon 
primarily NOAA/GHCN version 3 dataset (Lawrimore et al. 2011) and 
account for urban effects through nightlight adjustments (Hansen 
et  al. 2010). The  Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University 
of East Anglia, UK (CRUTEM) dataset, now version CRUTEM4.6, 
incorporates additional stations (Jones et  al. 2012). Finally, the 
Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) dataset provides LSAT 
from 1750 to present based on almost 46,000 time series and has the 
longest temporal coverage of the four datasets (Rohde et al. 2013). 
This dataset was derived with methods distinct from those used for 
development of the NOAA GHCNm, NASA/GISS GISTEMP and the 
University of East Anglia CRUTEM datasets.

According to the available observations in the four datasets, the 
globally averaged LSAT increased by 1.44°C from the preindustrial 
period (1850–1900) to the present day (1999–2018). The warming from 
the late 19th century (1881–1900) to the present day (1999–2018) 
was 1.41°C (1.31°C–1.51°C) (Table 2.1). The 1.31°C–1.51°C range 
represents the spread in median estimates from the four available 
land datasets and does not reflect uncertainty in data coverage or 
methods used. Based on the BEST dataset (the longest dataset with 
the most extensive land coverage) the total observed increase in 
LSAT between the average of the 1850–1900 period and the 2006–
2015 period was 1.53°C, (1.38–1.68°C; 95% confidence), while the 
GMST increase for the same period was 0.87°C (0.75–0.99°C; 90% 
confidence) (IPCC, 2018: Summary for policymakers, Allen et al. 2018).
The extended and improved land datasets reaffirmed the AR5 
conclusion that it is certain that globally averaged LSAT has risen 
since the preindustrial period and that this warming has been 
particularly marked since the 1970s (Figure 2.2).
Recent analyses of LSAT and sea surface temperature (SST) 
observations, as well as analyses of climate model simulations, have 
refined our understanding of underlying mechanisms responsible for 
a faster rate of warming over land than over oceans. Analyses of paleo 
records, historical observations, model simulations and underlying 
physical principles are all in agreement that the land is warming faster 
than the oceans as a result of differences in evaporation, land–climate 
feedbacks (Section 2.5) and changes in the aerosol forcing over land 
(very high confidence) (Braconnot et al. 2012; Joshi et al. 2013; Sejas 
et al. 2014; Byrne and O’Gorman 2013, 2015; Wallace and Joshi 2018; 
Allen et al. 2019). There is also high confidence that difference in land 
and ocean heat capacity is not the primary reason for faster land than 
ocean warming. For the recent period, the land-to-ocean warming 
ratio is in close agreement between different observational records 
(about 1.6) and the CMIP5 climate model simulations (the likely range 
of 1.54°C to 1.81°C). Earlier studies analysing slab ocean models 
(models in which it is assumed that the deep ocean has equilibrated) 
produced a higher land temperature increases than sea surface 
temperature (Manabe et al. 1991; Sutton et al. 2007).
It is certain that globally averaged LSAT has risen faster than 
GMST from the preindustrial period (1850–1900) to the present 
day (1999–2018). This is because the warming rate of the land 
compared to the ocean is substantially higher over the historical 
period (by approximately 60%) and because the Earth’s surface 
is approximately one-third land and two-thirds ocean. This 
enhanced land warming impacts land processes with implications 
for desertification (Section 2.2.2 and Chapter 3), food security 
(Section  2.2.3 and Chapter 5), terrestrial ecosystems (Section 
2.2.4), and GHG and non-GHG fluxes between the land and climate 
(Sections 2.3 and 2.4). Future changes in land characteristics 
through adaptation and mitigation processes and associated 
land–climate feedbacks can dampen warming in some regions 
and enhance warming in others (Section 2.5).
2.2.2 
Climate-driven changes in aridity
Desertification is defined and discussed at length in Chapter 3 and is 
a function of both human activity and climate variability and change. 
There are uncertainties in distinguishing between historical climate-
caused aridification and desertification and  future projections of 
aridity as different measurement methods of aridity do not agree on 
historical or projected changes (Sections 3.1.1 and 3.2.1). However, 
warming trends over drylands are twice the global average (Lickley 
and Solomon 2018) and some temperate drylands are projected to 
convert to subtropical drylands as a result of an increased drought 
frequency causing reduced soil moisture availability in the growing 
season (Engelbrecht et al. 2015; Schlaepfer et al. 2017). We therefore 
assess with medium confidence that a warming climate will result in 
regional increases in the spatial extent of drylands under mid- and 
high emission scenarios and that these regions will warm faster than 
the global average warming rate.
2.2.3 
The influence of climate change on food security
Food security and the various components thereof are addressed in 
depth in Chapter 5. Climate variables relevant to food security and food 
systems are predominantly temperature and precipitation-related, 
but also include integrated metrics that combine these and other 
variables (e.g., solar radiation, wind, humidity) and extreme weather 
and climate events including storm surge (Section 5.2.1). The impact 
of climate change through changes in these variables is projected to 
negatively impact all aspects of food security (food availability, access, 
utilisation and stability), leading to complex impacts on global food 
security (high confidence) (Chapter 5, Table 5.1).

Climate change will have regionally distributed impacts, even under 
aggressive mitigation scenarios (Howden et al. 2007; Rosenzweig et al. 
2013; Challinor et al. 2014; Parry et al. 2005; Lobell and Tebaldi 2014; 
Wheeler and Von Braun 2013). For example, in the northern 
hemisphere the northward expansion of warmer temperatures in 
the middle and higher latitudes will lengthen the growing season 
(Gregory and Marshall 2012; Yang et al. 2015b) which may benefit 
crop productivity (Parry et al. 2004; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Deryng 
et  al. 2016). However, continued rising temperatures are expected 
to impact global wheat yields by about 4–6% reductions for every 
degree of temperature rise (Liu et al. 2016a; Asseng et al. 2015) and 
across both mid- and low latitude regions, rising temperatures are 
also expected to be a constraining factor for maize productivity by 
the end of the century (Bassu et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2017). Although 
there has been a general reduction in frost occurrence during winter 
and spring, and a lengthening of the frost free season in response 
to growing concentrations of GHGs (Fischer and Knutti 2014; 
Wypych et al. 2017), there are regions where the frost season length 
has increased, for example, in southern Australia (Crimp et al. 2016). 
Despite the general reduced frost season length, late spring frosts may 
increase risk of damage to warming induced precocious vegetation 
growth and flowering (Meier et al. 2018). Observed and projected 
warmer minimum temperatures have, and will continue to, reduce the 
number of winter chill units required by temperate fruit and nut trees 
(Luedeling 2012). Crop yields are impacted negatively by increases of 
seasonal rainfall variability in the tropics, sub-tropics, water-limited 
and high elevation environments, while drought severity and growing 
season temperatures also have a negative impact on crop yield 
(Nelson et al. 2009; Schlenker and Lobell 2010; Müller et al. 2017; 
Parry et al. 2004; Wheeler and Von Braun 2013; Challinor et al. 2014). 
Changes in extreme weather and climate (Section 2.2.5) have 
negative impacts on food security through regional reductions of 
crop yields. A recent study shows that 18–43% of the explained yield 
variance of four crops (maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat) is 
attributable to extremes of temperature and rainfall, depending on 
the crop type (Vogel et al. 2019). Climate shocks, particularly severe 
drought impact low-income small-holder producers disproportionately 
(Vermeulen et al. 2012; Rivera Ferre 2014). Extremes also compromise 
critical food supply chain infrastructure, making transport of 
and access to  harvested food more difficult (Brown et  al. 2015; 
Fanzo  et  al.  2018). There is high confidence that the impacts of 
enhanced climate extremes, together with non-climate factors such 
as nutrient limitation, soil health and competitive plant species, 
generally outweighs the regionally positive impacts of warming 
(Lobell et al. 2011; Leakey et al. 2012; Porter et al. 2014; Gray et al. 
2016; Pugh et al. 2016; Wheeler and Von Braun 2013; Beer 2018). 
2.2.4 
Climate-driven changes in terrestrial ecosystems
Previously, the IPCC AR5 reported high confidence that the Earth’s 
biota composition and ecosystem processes have been strongly 
affected by past changes in global climate  and that the magnitudes 
of projected changes for the 21st century under high warming 
scenarios (for example, RCP8.5) are higher than those under historic 
climate change (Settele et al. 2014). There is high confidence that as a 
result of climate changes over recent decades many plant and animal 
species have experienced range size and location changes, altered 
abundances and shifts in seasonal activities (Urban 2015; Ernakovich 
et  al. 2014; Elsen and Tingley 2015; Hatfield and Prueger 2015; 
Savage and Vellend 2015; Yin et al. 2016; Pecl et al. 2017; Gonsamo 
et al. 2017; Fadrique et al. 2018; Laurance et al. 2018). There is high 
confidence that climate zones have already shifted in many parts of 
the world, primarily as an increase of dry, arid climates accompanied 
by a decrease of polar climates (Chan and Wu 2015; Chen and Chen 
2013; Spinoni et al. 2015b). Regional climate zones shifts have been 
observed over the Asian monsoon region (Son and Bae 2015), Europe 
(Jylhä et al. 2010), China (Yin et al. 2019), Pakistan (Adnan et al. 
2017), the Alps (Rubel et al. 2017) and north-eastern Brazil, southern 
Argentina, the Sahel, Zambia and Zimbabwe, the Mediterranean 
area, Alaska, Canada and north-eastern Russia (Spinoni et al. 2015b).
There is high confidence that bioclimates zones will further shift as 
the climate warms (Williams et  al. 2007; Rubel and Kottek 2010; 
Garcia et al. 2016; Mahony et al. 2017; Law et al. 2018). There is also 
high confidence that novel, unprecedented climates (climate conditions 
with no analogue in the observational record) will emerge, particularly 
in the tropics (Williams and Jackson 2007; Colwell  et  al.  2008a; 
Mora et al. 2013, 2014; Hawkins et al. 2014; Mahony et al. 2017; 
Maule et al. 2017). It is very likely that terrestrial ecosystems and land 
processes will be exposed to disturbances beyond the range of current 
natural variability as a result of global warming, even under low- to 
medium-range warming scenarios, and that these disturbances 
will alter the structure, composition and functioning of the system 
(Settele et al. 2014; Gauthier et al. 2015; Seddon et al. 2016). 
In a warming climate, many species will be unable to track their 
climate niche as it moves, especially those in extensive flat landscapes 
with low dispersal capacity and in the tropics whose thermal optimum 
is already near current temperature (Diffenbaugh and Field 2013; 
Warszawski et  al. 2013). Range expansion in higher latitudes and 
elevations as a result of warming often, but not exclusively, occurs 
in abandoned lands (Harsch et  al. 2009; Landhäusser et  al. 2010; 
Gottfried et al. 2012; Boisvert-Marsh et al. 2014; Bryn and Potthoff 
2018; Rumpf et al. 2018; Buitenwerf et al. 2018; Steinbauer et al. 2018). 
This expansion typically favours thermophilic species at the expense 
of cold adapted species as the climate becomes suitable for lower 
latitude/altitude species (Rumpf et al. 2018). In temperate drylands, 
however, range expansion can be countered by intense and frequent 
drought conditions which result in accelerated rates of taxonomic 
change and spatial heterogeneity in an ecotone (Tietjen et al. 2017). 
Since the advent of satellite observation platforms, a global increase 
in vegetation photosynthetic activity (i.e., greening) as evidenced 
through remotely sensed indices such as leaf area index (LAI) and 
normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Three satellite-based 
leaf area index records (GIMMS3g, GLASS and GLOMAP) imply 
increased growing season LAI (greening) over 25–50% and browning 
over less than 4% of the global vegetated area, resulting in greening 
trend of 0.068 ± 0.045 m2 m−2 yr−1 over 1982–2009 (Zhu et al. 2016). 
Greening has been observed in southern Amazonia, southern 
Australia, the Sahel and central Africa, India, eastern China and the 
northern extratropical latitudes (Myneni et al. 1997; de Jong et al.

2012; Los 2013; Piao et al. 2015; Mao et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2016; 
Carlson et al. 2017; Forzieri et al. 2017; Pan et al. 2018; Chen et al. 
2019). Greening has been attributed to direct factors, namely human 
land use management and indirect factors such as CO2 fertilisation, 
climate change, and nitrogen deposition (Donohue et  al. 2013; 
Keenan et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 2016). Indirect factors have been used 
to explain most greening trends primarily through CO2 fertilisation in 
the tropics and through an extended growing season and increased 
growing season temperatures as a result of climate change in the 
high latitudes (Fensholt et al. 2012; Zhu et al. 2016). The extension 
of the growing season in high latitudes has occurred together with 
an earlier spring greenup (the time at which plants begin to produce 
leaves in northern mid- and high-latitude ecosystems) (Goetz et al. 
2015; Xu et al. 2016a, 2018) with subsequent earlier spring carbon 
uptake (2.3 days per decade) and gross primary productivity (GPP) 
(Pulliainen et  al. 2017). The role of direct factors of greening are 
being increasingly investigated and a recent study has attributed 
over a third of observed global greening between 2000 and 2017 to 
direct factors, namely afforestation and croplands, in China and India 
(Chen et al. 2019). 
It should be noted that measured greening is a product of satellite-
derived radiance data and, as such, does not provide information 
on ecosystem health indicators such as species composition and 
richness, homeostasis, absence of disease, vigour, system resilience 
and the different components of ecosystems (Jørgensen et  al. 
2016). For example, a regional greening attributable to croplands 
expansion or intensification might occur at the expense of 
ecosystem biodiversity. 
Within the global greening trend are also detected regional 
decreases in vegetation photosynthetic activity (i.e., browning) in 
northern Eurasia, the southwestern USA, boreal forests in North 
America, inner Asia and the Congo Basin, largely as a result of 
intensified drought stress. Since the late 1990s rates and extents 
of browning have exceeded those of greening in some regions, 
the collective result of which has been a slowdown of the global 
greening rate (de Jong et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2018). Within these 
long-term trends, inter-annual variability of regional greening and 
browning is attributable to regional climate variability, responses to 
extremes such as drought, disease and insect infestation and large-
scale tele-connective controls such as ENSO and the Atlantic Multi-
decadal Organization (Verbyla 2008; Revadekar et al. 2012; Epstein 
et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018). 
Projected increases in drought conditions in many regions suggest 
long-term global vegetation greening trends are at risk of reversal to 
browning in a warmer climate (de Jong et al. 2012; Pan et al. 2018; 
Pausas and Millán 2018). On the other hand, in higher latitudes 
vegetation productivity is projected to increase as a result of 
higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations and longer growing periods 
as a result of warming (Ito et al. 2016) (Section 2.3 and Box 2.3). 
Additionally, climate-driven transitions of ecosystems, particularly 
range changes, can take years to decades for the equilibrium state 
to be realised and the rates of these ‘committed ecosystem changes’ 
(Jones et al. 2009) vary between low and high latitudes (Jones et al. 
2010). Furthermore, as direct factors are poorly integrated into Earth 
systems models (ESMs) uncertainties in projected trends of greening 
and browning are further compounded (Buitenwerf et al. 2018; Chen 
et al. 2019). Therefore, there is low confidence in the projection of 
global greening and browning trends.
Increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations have both direct and 
indirect effects on terrestrial ecosystems (Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, 
and Box 2.3). The direct effect is primarily through increased 
vegetation photosynthetic activity as described above. Indirect 
effects include decreased evapotranspiration that may offset the 
projected impact of drought in some water-stressed plants through 
improved water use efficiency in temperate regions, suggesting that 
some rain-fed cropping systems and grasslands will benefit from 
elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Roy et al. 2016; Milly and 
Dunne 2016; Swann et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2017; Zhu et al. 2017). 
In tropical regions, increased flowering activity is associated 
primarily with increasing atmospheric CO2, suggesting that a long-
term increase in flowering activity may persist in some vegetation, 
particularly mid-story trees and tropical shrubs, and may enhance 
reproduction levels until limited by nutrient availability or climate 
factors such as drought frequency, rising temperatures, and reduced 
insolation (Pau et al. 2018). 
2.2.5 
Climate extremes and their impact 
on land functioning
Extreme weather events are generally defined as the upper or lower 
statistical tails of the observed range of values of climate variables 
or climate indicators (e.g., temperature/rainfall or drought/aridity 
indices respectively). Previous IPCC reports have reported with 
high confidence on the increase of many types of observed extreme 
temperature events (Seneviratne et al. 2012; Hartmann et al. 2013b; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). However, as a result of observational 
constraints, increases in precipitation extremes are less confident, 
except in observations-rich regions with dense, long-lived station 
networks, such as Europe and North America, where there have been 
likely increases in the frequency or intensity of heavy rainfall.
Extreme events occur across a wide range of time and space scales 
(Figure 2.3) and may include individual, relatively short-lived weather 
events (e.g., extreme thunderstorms storms) or a combination or 
accumulation of non-extreme events (Colwell et al. 2008b; Handmer 
et al. 2012), for example, moderate rainfall in a saturated catchment 
having the flood peak at mean high tide (Leonard et  al. 2014). 
Combinatory processes leading to a significant impact are referred to 
as a compound event and are a function of the nature and number of 
physical climate and land variables, biological agents such as pests 
and disease, the range of spatial and temporal scales, the strength 
of dependence between processes and the perspective of the 
stakeholder who defines the impact (Leonard et al. 2014; Millar and 
Stephenson 2015). Currently, there is low confidence in the impact 
of compound events on land as the multi-disciplinary approaches 
needed to address the problem are few (Zscheischler et al. 2018) and 
the rarity of compound extreme climatic events renders the analysis 
of impacts difficult.

2.2.5.1 
Changes in extreme temperatures, 
heatwaves and drought
It is very likely that most land areas have experienced a decrease in 
the number of cold days and nights, and an increase in the number 
of warm days and unusually hot nights (Orlowsky and Seneviratne 
2012; Seneviratne et al. 2012; Mishra et al. 2015; Ye et al. 2018). 
Although there is no consensus defi nition of heatwaves, as some 
heatwave indices have relative thresholds and others absolute 
thresholds, trends between indices of the same type show that recent 
heat-related events have been made more frequent or more intense 
due to anthropogenic GHG emissions in most land regions (Lewis 
and Karoly 2013; Smith et al. 2013b; Scherer and Diffenbaugh 2014; 
Fischer and Knutti 2015; Ceccherini et al. 2016; King et al. 2016; Bador 
et al. 2016; Stott et al. 2016; King 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). 
Globally, 50–80% of the land fraction is projected to experience 
signifi cantly more intense hot extremes than historically recorded 
(Fischer and Knutti 2014; Diffenbaugh et al. 2015; Seneviratne et al. 
2016). There is high confi dence that heatwaves will increase in 
frequency, intensity and duration into the 21st century (Russo et al. 
2016; Ceccherini et al. 2017; Herrera-Estrada and Sheffi eld 2017) and 
under high emission scenarios, heatwaves by the end of the century 
may become extremely long (more than 60 consecutive days) and 
frequent (once every two years) in Europe, North America, South 
America, Africa, Indonesia, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia 
and Australia (Rusticucci 2012; Cowan et al. 2014; Russo et al. 2014; 
Scherer and Diffenbaugh 2014; Pal and Eltahir 2016; Rusticucci et al. 
2016; Schär 2016; Teng et al. 2016; Dosio 2017; Mora et al. 2017; 
Dosio et al. 2018; Lehner et al. 2018; Lhotka et al. 2018; Lopez et al. 
2018; Tabari  and Willems 2018). Furthermore, unusual heatwave 
conditions today will occur regularly by 2040 under the RCP 8.5 
scenario (Russo  et  al. 2016). The intensity of heat events may be 
modulated by land cover and soil characteristics (Miralles et al. 2014; 
Lemordant et  al. 2016; Ramarao et  al. 2016). Where temperature 
increase results in decreased soil moisture, latent heat fl ux is 
reduced while sensible heat fl uxes are increased, allowing surface air 
temperature to rise further. However, this feedback may be diminished 
if the land surface is irrigated through enhanced evapotranspiration 
(Mueller et al. 2015; Siebert et al. 2017) (Section 2.5.2.2). 
Drought (IPCC 2013c), including megadroughts of the last century, 
for example, the Dustbowl drought (Hegerl et al. 2018) (Chapter 5), 
is a normal component of climate variability (Hoerling et al. 2010; 
Dai 2011) and may be seasonal, multi-year (Van Dijk et al. 2013) 
or multi-decadal (Hulme 2001) with increasing degrees of impact 
on regional activities. This inter-annual variability is controlled 
particularity through remote sea surface temperature (SST) forcings, 
such as the Inter-decadal Pacifi c Oscillation (IPO) and the Atlantic 
Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), El Niño/Southern Oscillation 
(ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), that cause drought as 
a result of reduced rainfall (Kelley et al. 2015; Dai 2011; Hoell et al. 
2017; Espinoza et al. 2018). In some cases however, large scale SST

modes do not fully explain the severity of drought some recent event 
attribution studies have identified a climate change fingerprint 
in several regional droughts, for example, the western Amazon 
(Erfanian et al. 2017), southern Africa (Funk et al. 2018; Yuan et al. 
2018), southern Europe and the Mediterranean including North 
Africa (Kelley et al. 2015; Wilcox et al. 2018), parts of North America 
(Williams et al. 2015; Mote et al. 2016), Russia (Otto et al. 2012), 
India (Ramarao et al. 2015) and Australia (Lewis and Karoly 2013). 
Long-term global trends in drought are difficult to determine because 
of this natural variability, potential deficiencies in drought indices 
(especially in how evapotranspiration is treated) and the quality 
and availability of precipitation data (Sheffield et al. 2012; Dai 2013; 
Trenberth et  al. 2014; Nicholls and Seneviratne 2015; Mukherjee 
et  al. 2018). However, regional trends in frequency and intensity 
of drought are evident in several parts of the world, particularly in 
low latitude land areas, such as the Mediterranean, North Africa 
and the Middle East (Vicente-Serrano et  al. 2014; Spinoni et  al. 
2015a; Dai and Zhao 2017; Páscoa et  al. 2017), many regions of 
sub-Saharan Africa (Masih et al. 2014; Dai and Zhao 2017), central 
China (Wang  et  al. 2017e), the southern Amazon (Fu et  al. 2013; 
Espinoza et al. 2018), India (Ramarao et al. 2016), east and south 
Asia, parts of North America and eastern Australia (Dai and Zhao 
2017). A recent analysis of 4500 meteorological droughts globally 
found increased drought frequency over the East Coast of the USA, 
Amazonia and north-eastern Brazil, Patagonia, the Mediterranean 
region, most of Africa and north-eastern China with decreased 
drought frequency over northern Argentina, Uruguay and northern 
Europe (Spinoni et al. 2019). The study also found drought intensity 
has become more severe over north-western USA, parts of Patagonia 
and southern Chile, the Sahel, the Congo River basin, southern 
Europe, north-eastern China, and south-eastern Australia, whereas 
the eastern USA, south-eastern Brazil, northern Europe, and central-
northern Australia experienced less severe droughts. In addition 
to the IPCC SR15 assessment of medium confidence in increased 
drying over the Mediterranean region (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), 
it is further assessed with medium confidence that frequency and 
intensity of droughts in Amazonia, north-eastern Brazil, Patagonia, 
most of Africa, and north-eastern China has increased.
There is low confidence in how large-scale modes of variability will 
respond to a warming climate (Deser et al. 2012; Liu 2012; Christensen 
et al. 2013; Hegerl et al. 2015; Newman et al. 2016). Although, there 
is evidence for an increased frequency of extreme ENSO events, such 
as the 1997/98 El Niño and 1988/89 La Niña (Cai et al. 2014a, 2015) 
and extreme positive phases of the IOD (Christensen et al. 2013; Cai 
et al. 2014b). However, the assessment by the SR15 was retained on 
an increased regional drought risk (medium confidence), specifically 
over the Mediterranean and South Africa at both 1.5°C and 2°C 
warming levels compared to present day, with drought risk at 2°C 
being significantly higher than at 1.5°C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). 
2.2.5.2 
Impacts of heat extremes and drought on land
There is high confidence that heat extremes such as unusually 
hot nights, extremely high daytime temperatures, heatwaves and 
drought are damaging to crop production (Chapter 5). Extreme heat 
events impact a wide variety of tree functions including reduced 
photosynthesis, increased photooxidative stress, leaves abscise, 
a decreased growth rate of remaining leaves and decreased growth of 
the whole tree (Teskey et al. 2015). Although trees are more resilient to 
heat stress than grasslands (Teuling et al. 2010), it has been observed 
that different types of forest (e.g., needleleaf vs broadleaf) respond 
differently to drought and heatwaves (Babst et al. 2012). For example, 
in the Turkish Anatolian forests net primary productivity (NPP) generally 
decreased during drought and heatwave events between 2000 and 
2010 but in a few other regions, NPP of needle leaf forests increased 
(Erşahin et al. 2016). However, forests may become less resilient to heat 
stress in future due to the long recovery period required to replace lost 
biomass and the projected increased frequency of heat and drought 
events (Frank et al. 2015a; McDowell and Allen 2015; Johnstone et al. 
2016; Stevens-Rumann et al. 2018). Additionally, widespread regional 
tree mortality may be triggered directly by drought and heat stress 
(including warm winters) and exacerbated by insect outbreak and fire 
(Neuvonen et al. 1999; Breshears et al. 2005; Berg et al. 2006; Soja et al. 
2007; Kurz et al. 2008; Allen et al. 2010).
Gross primary production (GPP) and soil respiration form the first 
and second largest carbon fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems to 
the atmosphere in the global carbon cycle (Beer et al. 2010; Bond-
Lamberty and Thomson 2010). Heat extremes impact the carbon 
cycle through altering these and change ecosystem-atmosphere 
CO2 fluxes and the ecosystem carbon balance. Compound heat and 
drought events result in a stronger carbon sink reduction compared 
to single-factor extremes as GPP is strongly reduced and ecosystem 
respiration less so (Reichstein et al. 2013; Von Buttlar et al. 2018). 
In forest biomes, however, GPP may increase temporarily as a result 
of increased insolation and photosynthetic activity as was seen 
during the 2015–2016 ENSO related drought over Amazonia (Zhu 
et al. 2018). Longer extreme events (heatwave or drought or both) 
result in a greater reduction in carbon sequestration and may also 
reverse long-term carbon sinks (Ciais et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2009; 
Wolf et al. 2016b; Ummenhofer and Meehl 2017; Von Buttlar et al. 
2018; Reichstein et  al. 2013). Furthermore, extreme heat events 
may impact the carbon cycle beyond the lifetime of the event. These 
lagged effects can slow down or accelerate the carbon cycle: it will 
slow down if reduced vegetation productivity and/or widespread 
mortality after an extreme drought are not compensated by 
regeneration, or speed up if productive tree and shrub seedlings 
cause rapid regrowth after windthrow or fire (Frank et al. 2015a). 
Although some ecosystems may demonstrate resilience to a single 
heat climate stressor like drought (e.g., forests), compound effects 
of, for example, deforestation, fire and drought, potentially can result 
in changes to regional precipitation patterns and river discharge, 
losses of carbon storage and a transition to a disturbance-dominated 
regime (Davidson et al. 2012). Additionally, adaptation to seasonal 
drought may be overwhelmed by multi-year drought and their legacy 
effects (Brando et al. 2008; da Costa et al. 2010). 
Under medium- and high-emission scenarios, global warming will 
exacerbate heat stress, thereby amplifying deficits in soil moisture 
and runoff despite uncertain precipitation changes (Ficklin and Novick 
2017; Berg and Sheffield 2018; Cook et al. 2018; Dai et al. 2018; 
Engelbrecht et al. 2015; Ramarao et al. 2015; Grillakis 2019). This will 
147

increase the rate of drying causing drought to set in quicker, become 
more intense and widespread, last longer and could result in an 
increased global aridity (Dai 2011; Prudhomme et al. 2014). 
The projected changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme 
temperatures and drought is expected to result in decreased carbon 
sequestration by ecosystems and degradation of ecosystems health 
and loss of resilience (Trumbore et  al. 2015). Also affected are 
many aspects of land functioning and type including agricultural 
productivity (Lesk et al. 2016), hydrology (Mosley 2015; Van Loon and 
Laaha 2015), vegetation productivity and distribution (Xu et al. 2011; 
Zhou et al. 2014), carbon fluxes and stocks, and other biogeochemical 
cycles (Frank et  al. 2015b; Doughty et  al. 2015; Schlesinger et  al. 
2016). Carbon stocks are particularly vulnerable to extreme events 
due to their large carbon pools and fluxes, potentially large lagged 
impacts and long recovery times to regain lost stocks (Frank et al. 
2015a) (Section 2.2).
2.2.5.3 
 Changes in heavy precipitation
A large number of extreme rainfall events have been documented 
over the past decades (Coumou and Rahmstorf 2012; Seneviratne 
et  al. 2012; Trenberth 2012; Westra et  al. 2013; Espinoza et  al. 
2014; Guhathakurta et al. 2017; Taylor et al. 2017; Thompson et al. 
2017; Zilli et al. 2017). The observed shift in the trend distribution 
of precipitation extremes is more distinct than for annual mean 
precipitation and the global land fraction experiencing more intense 
precipitation events is larger than expected from internal variability 
(Fischer and Knutti 2014; Espinoza et al. 2018; Fischer et al. 2013). As 
a result of global warming, the number of record-breaking rainfall 
events globally has increased significantly by 12% during the period 
1981–2010 compared to those expected due to natural multi-decadal 
climate variability (Lehmann et al. 2015). The IPCC SR15 reports robust 
increases in observed precipitation extremes for annual maximum 
1-day precipitation (RX1day) and consecutive 5-day precipitation 
(RX5day) (Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 2018; Schleussner et  al. 2017). 
A number of extreme rainfall events have been attributed to human 
influence (Min et al. 2011; Pall et al. 2011; Sippel and Otto 2014; 
Trenberth et al. 2015; Krishnan et al. 2016) and the largest fraction 
of anthropogenic influence is evident in the most rare and extreme 
events (Fischer and Knutti 2014). 
A warming climate is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle as 
a warmer climate facilitates more water vapour in the atmosphere, 
as approximated by the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relationship, 
with subsequent effects on regional extreme precipitation events 
(Christensen and Christensen 2003; Pall et al. 2007; Berg et al. 2013; 
Wu et  al. 2013; Guhathakurta et  al. 2017; Thompson et  al. 2017; 
Taylor et al. 2017; Zilli et al. 2017; Manola et al. 2018). Furthermore, 
changes to the dynamics of the atmosphere amplify or weaken 
future precipitation extremes at the regional scale (O’Gorman 2015; 
Pfahl et  al. 2017). Continued anthropogenic warming is very likely 
to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall in many 
regions of the globe (Seneviratne et al. 2012; Mohan and Rajeevan 
2017; Prein et  al. 2017; Stott et  al. 2016) although many general 
circulation models (GCMs) underestimate observed increased trends in 
heavy precipitation suggesting a substantially stronger intensification 
of future heavy rainfall than the multi-model mean (Borodina 
et al. 2017; Min et al. 2011). Furthermore, the response of extreme 
convective precipitation to warming remains uncertain because GCMs 
and regional climate models (RCMs) are unable to explicitly simulate 
sub-grid scale processes such as convection, the hydrological cycle 
and surface fluxes and have to rely on parameterisation schemes for 
this (Crétat et al. 2012; Rossow et al. 2013; Wehner 2013; Kooperman 
et al. 2014; O’Gorman 2015; Larsen et al. 2016; Chawla et al. 2018; 
Kooperman et al. 2018; Maher et al. 2018; Rowell and Chadwick 2018). 
High-resolution RCMs that explicitly resolve convection have a better 
representation of extreme precipitation but are dependent on the GCM 
to capture the large scale environment in which the extreme event 
may occur (Ban et al. 2015; Prein et al. 2015; Kendon et al. 2017). Inter-
annual variability of precipitation extremes in the convective tropics 
are not well captured by global models (Allan and Liu 2018). 
There is low confidence in the detection of long-term observed 
and projected seasonal and daily trends of extreme snowfall. The 
narrow rain–snow transition temperature range at which extreme 
snowfall can occur is relatively insensitive to climate warming 
and subsequent large interdecadal variability (Kunkel et al. 2013; 
O’Gorman 2014, 2015).
2.2.5.4 
Impacts of precipitation extremes 
on different land cover types 
More intense rainfall leads to water redistribution between surface 
and ground water in catchments as water storage in the soil 
decreases (green water) and runoff and reservoir inflow increases 
(blue water) (Liu and Yang 2010; Eekhout et al. 2018). This results 
in increased surface flooding and soil erosion, increased plant water 
stress and reduced water security, which in terms of agriculture 
means an increased dependency on irrigation and reservoir storage 
(Nainggolan et al. 2012; Favis-Mortlock and Mullen 2011; García-
Ruiz et al. 2011; Li and Fang 2016; Chagas and Chaffe 2018). As 
there is high confidence of a positive correlation between global 
warming and future flood risk, land cover and processes are likely 
to be negatively impacted, particularly near rivers and in floodplains 
(Kundzewicz et al. 2014; Alfieri et al. 2016; Winsemius et al. 2016; 
Arnell and Gosling 2016; Alfieri et al. 2017; Wobus et al. 2017). 
In agricultural systems, heavy precipitation and inundation can 
delay planting, increase soil compaction and cause crop losses 
through anoxia and root diseases (Posthumus et al. 2009). In tropical 
regions, flooding associated with tropical cyclones can lead to crop 
failure from both rainfall and storm surge. In some cases, flooding 
can affect yield more than drought, particularly in tropical regions 
(e.g., India) and in some mid/high latitude regions such as China and 
central and northern Europe (Zampieri et al. 2017). Waterlogging of 
croplands and soil erosion also negatively affect farm operations 
and block important transport routes (Vogel and Meyer 2018; 
Kundzewicz and Germany 2012). Flooding can be beneficial in 
drylands if the floodwaters infiltrate and recharge alluvial aquifers 
along ephemeral river pathways, extending water availability into 
dry seasons and drought years, and supporting riparian systems 
and human communities (Kundzewicz and Germany 2012; Guan 
et al. 2015). Globally, the impact of rainfall extremes on agriculture 
148
Chapter 2

is less than that of temperature extremes and drought, although in 
some regions and for some crops, extreme precipitation explains 
a greater component of yield variability, for example, of maize in 
the Midwestern USA and southern Africa (Ray et al. 2015; Lesk et al. 
2016; Vogel et al. 2019).
Although many soils on floodplains regularly suffer from inundation, 
the increases in the magnitude of flood events mean that new 
areas with no recent history of flooding are now becoming severely 
affected (Yellen et  al. 2014). Surface flooding and associated soil 
saturation often results in decreased soil quality through nutrient 
loss, reduced plant productivity, stimulated microbial growth and 
microbial community composition, negatively impacted soil redox 
and increased GHG emissions (Bossio and Scow 1998; Niu et  al. 
2014; Barnes et al. 2018; Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. 2019). The impact 
of flooding on soil quality is influenced by management systems that 
may mitigate or exacerbate the impact. Although soils tend to recover 
quickly after floodwater removal, the impact of repeated extreme 
flood events over longer timescales on soil quality and function is 
unclear (Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. 2017).
Flooding in ecosystems may be detrimental through erosion or 
permanent habitat loss, or beneficial, as a flood pulse brings nutrients 
to downstream regions (Kundzewicz et al. 2014). Riparian forests can 
be damaged through flooding; however, increased flooding may also 
be of benefit to forests where upstream water demand has lowered 
stream flow, but this is difficult to assess and the effect of flooding 
on forests is not well studied (Kramer et al. 2008; Pawson et al. 2013). 
Forests may mitigate flooding, however flood mitigation potential 
is limited by soil saturation and rainfall intensity (Pilaš et al. 2011; 
Ellison et  al. 2017). Some grassland species under heavy rainfall 
and soil saturated conditions responded negatively with decreased 
reproductive biomass and germination rates (Gellesch et al. 2017), 
however overall productivity in grasslands remains constant in 
response to heavy rainfall (Grant et al. 2014). 
Extreme rainfall alters responses of soil CO2 fluxes and CO2 uptake 
by plants within ecosystems, and therefore result in changes in 
ecosystem carbon cycling (Fay et  al. 2008; Frank et  al. 2015a). 
Extreme rainfall and flooding limits oxygen in soil which may 
suppress the activities of soil microbes and plant roots and lower 
soil respiration, therefore lowering carbon cycling (Knapp et  al. 
2008; Rich and Watt 2013; Philben et al. 2015). However, the impact 
of extreme rainfall on carbon fluxes in different biomes differs. For 
example, extreme rainfall in mesic biomes reduces soil CO2 flux 
to the atmosphere and GPP whereas in xeric biomes the opposite 
is true, largely as a result of increased soil water availability 
(Knapp  and Smith 2001; Heisler and Knapp 2008; Heisler-White 
et al. 2009; Zeppel et al. 2014; Xu and Wang 2016; Liu et al. 2017b; 
Connor and Hawkes 2018). 
As shown above GHG fluxes between the land and atmosphere are 
affected by climate. The next section assesses these fluxes in greater 
detail and the potential for land as a carbon sink.
Cross-Chapter Box 3 |  Fire and climate change
Raman Sukumar (India), Almut Arneth (Germany), Werner Kurz (Canada), Andrey Sirin (Russian Federation), Louis Verchot (Colombia/The 
United States of America)
Fires have been a natural part of Earth’s geological past and its biological evolution since at least the late Silurian, about 
400 million years ago (Scott 2000). Presently, roughly 3% of the Earth’s land surface burns annually which affects both energy 
and  matter exchanges between the land and atmosphere (Stanne et  al. 2009). Climate is a major determinant of fire regimes 
through its control of fire weather, as well as through its interaction with vegetation productivity (fuel availability) and structure (fuel 
distribution and flammability) (Archibald et al. 2013) at the global (Krawchuk and Moritz 2011), regional (Pausas and Paula 2012) 
and local (Mondal and Sukumar 2016) landscape scales. Presently, humans are the main cause of fire ignition with lightning playing a 
lesser role globally (Bowman et al. 2017; Harris et al. 2016), although the latter factor has been predominantly responsible for large fires 
in regions such as the North American boreal forests (Veraverbeke et al. 2017). Humans also influence fires by actively extinguishing 
them, reducing spread and managing fuels.
Historical trends and drivers in land area burnt
While precipitation has been the major influence on fire regimes before the Holocene, human activities have become the dominant drivers 
since then (Bowman et al. 2011). There was less biomass burning during the 20th century than at any time during the past two millennia 
as inferred from charcoal sedimentary records (Doerr and Santín 2016), though there has been an increase in the most recent decades 
(Marlon et al. 2016). Trends in land area burnt have varied regionally (Giglio et al. 2013). Northern hemisphere Africa has experienced a fire 
decrease of 1.7 Mha yr–1 (–1.4% yr–1) since 2000, while southern hemisphere Africa saw an increase of 2.3 Mha yr–1 (+1.8% yr–1) during 
the same period. Southeast Asia witnessed a small increase of 0.2 Mha yr–1 (+2.5% yr–1) since 1997, while Australia experienced a sharp 
decrease of about 5.5 Mha yr–1 (–10.7% yr–1) during 2001–2011, followed by an upsurge in 2011 that exceeded the annual area burned 
in the previous 14 years. A recent analysis using the Global Fire Emissions Database v.4 (GFED4s) that includes small fires concluded that 
the net reduction in land area burnt globally during 1998–2015 was –24.3 ± 8.8% (–1.35 ± 0.49% yr–1) (Andela et al. 2017). However, 
from the point of fire emissions it is important to consider the land cover types which have experienced changes in area burned; in 
this instance, most of the declines have come from grasslands, savannas and other non-forest land cover types (Andela et al. 2017). 
Significant increases in forest area burned (with higher fuel consumption per unit area) have been recorded in western and boreal 
149

Cross-Chapter Box 3 (continued)
North America (Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Ansmann et al. 2018) and in boreal Siberia (Ponomarev et al. 2016) in recent times. 
The 2017 and 2018 fires in British Columbia, Canada, were the largest ever recorded since the 1950s with 1.2 Mha and 1.4 Mha of forest 
burnt, respectively (Hanes et al. 2018) and smoke from these fires reaching the stratosphere over central Europe (Ansmann et al. 2018). 
Climate variability and extreme climatic events such as severe drought, especially those associated with the El Niño Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO), play a major role in fire upsurges, as in equatorial Asia (Huijnen et al. 2016). Fire emissions in tropical forests 
increased by 133% on average during and following six El Niño years compared to six La Niña years during 1997–2016, due to 
reductions in precipitation and terrestrial water storage (Chen et al. 2017). The expansion of agriculture and deforestation in the humid 
tropics has also made these regions more vulnerable to drought-driven fires (Davidson et al. 2012; Brando et al. 2014). Even when 
deforestation rates were overall declining, as in the Brazilian Amazon during 2003–2015, the incidence of fire increased by 36% 
during the drought of 2015 (Aragão et al. 2018). 
GHG emissions from fires
Emissions from wildfires and biomass burning are a significant source of GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), carbonaceous 
aerosols, and an array of other gases including non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) (Akagi et al. 2011; Van Der Werf 
et al. 2010). GFED4s has updated fire-related carbon emission estimates biome-wise (regionally and globally), using higher resolution 
input data gridded at 0.25˚, a new burned area dataset with small fires, improved fire emission factors (Akagi et al. 2011; Urbanski 
2014) and better fire severity characterisation of boreal forests (van der Werf et al. 2017). The estimates for the period 1997–2016 are 
2.2 GtC yr–1, being highest in the 1997 El Nino (3.0 GtC yr–1) and lowest in 2013 (1.8 GtC yr–1). Furthermore, fire emissions during 
1997–2016 were dominated by savanna (65.3%), followed by tropical forest (15.1%), boreal forest (7.4%), temperate forest (2.3%), 
peatland (3.7%) and agricultural waste burning (6.3%) (van der Werf et al. 2017).
Fires not only transfer carbon from land to the atmosphere but also between different terrestrial pools: from live to dead biomass 
to soil, including partially charred biomass, charcoal and soot constituting 0.12–0.39 GtC yr–1 or 0.2–0.6% of annual terrestrial NPP 
(Doerr and Santín 2016). Carbon from the atmosphere is sequestered back into regrowing vegetation at rates specific to the type of 
vegetation and other environmental variables (Loehman et al. 2014). Fire emissions are thus not necessarily a net source of carbon 
into the atmosphere, as post-fire recovery of vegetation can sequester a roughly equivalent amount back into biomass over a time 
period of one to a few years (in grasslands and agricultural lands) to decades (in forests) (Landry and Matthews 2016). Fires from 
deforestation (for land use change) and on peatlands (which store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation) obviously are a net 
source of carbon from the land to the atmosphere (Turetsky et al. 2014); these types of fires were estimated to emit 0.4 GtC yr–1 
in recent decades (van der Werf et al. 2017). Peatland fires dominated by smouldering combustion under low temperatures and 
high moisture conditions can burn for long periods (Turetsky et al. 2014).
Fires, land degradation/desertification and land-atmosphere exchanges 
Flammable ecosystems are generally adapted to their specific fire regimes (Bond et al. 2005). A fire regime shift alters vegetation 
and soil properties in complex ways, both in the short- and the long-term, with consequences for carbon stock changes, albedo, 
fire-atmosphere-vegetation feedbacks and the ultimate biological capacity of the burnt land (Bond et al. 2004; Bremer and Ham 1999; 
MacDermott et al. 2016; Tepley et al. 2018; Moody et al. 2013; Veraverbeke et al. 2012) A fire-driven shift in vegetation from a forested 
state to an alternative stable state such as a grassland (Fletcher et al. 2014; Moritz 2015) with much less carbon stock is a distinct 
possibility. Fires cause soil erosion through action of wind and water (Moody et al. 2013) thus resulting in land degradation (Chapter 4) 
and eventually desertification (Chapter 3). Fires also affect carbon exchange between land and atmosphere through ozone (which 
retards photosynthesis) and aerosol (which slightly increases diffuse radiation) emissions. The net effect from fire on global GPP during 
2002–2011 is estimated to be –0.86 ± 0.74 GtC yr–1 (Yue and Unger 2018).
Fires under future climate change
Temperature increase and precipitation decline would be the major driver of fire regimes under future climates as evapotranspiration 
increases and soil moisture decreases (Pechony and Shindell 2010; Aldersley et al. 2011; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Fernandes et al. 
2017). The risk of wildfires in future could be expected to change, increasing significantly in North America, South America, central Asia, 
southern Europe, southern Africa and Australia (Liu et al. 2010). There is emerging evidence that recent regional surges in wildland 
fires are being driven by changing weather extremes, thereby signalling geographical shifts in fire proneness (Jolly et al. 2015). Fire 
weather season has already lengthened by 18.7% globally between 1979 and 2013, with statistically significant increases across 
25.3% but decreases only across 10.7% of Earth’s land surface covered with vegetation. Even sharper changes have been observed 
during the second half of this period (Jolly et al. 2015). Correspondingly, the global area experiencing long fire weather seasons 
(defined as experiencing a fire weather season greater than one standard deviation (SD) 
150
Chapter 2

from the mean global value) has increased by 3.1% per annum or 108.1% during 1979–2013. Fire frequencies under 2050 conditions 
are projected to increase by approximately 27% globally, relative to the 2000 levels, with changes in future fire meteorology playing 
the most important role in enhancing global wildfires, followed by land cover changes, lightning activities and land use, while changes 
in population density exhibit the opposite effects (Huang et al. 2014). 
However, climate is only one driver of a complex set of environmental, ecological and human factors in infl uencing fi re regimes 
(Bowman et al. 2011). While these factors lead to complex projections of future burnt area and fi re emissions (Knorr et al. 2016a, b), 
human exposure to wildland fi res could still increase due to population expansion into areas already under high risk of fi res (Knorr 
et al. 2016a, b). There are still major challenges in projecting future fi re regimes and how climate, vegetation and socio/economic 
factors will interact (Hantson et al. 2016; Harris et al. 2016). There is also need for integrating various fi re management strategies, such 
as fuel-reduction treatments in natural and planted forests, with other environmental and societal considerations to achieve the goals 
of carbon emissions reductions, maintain water quality, biodiversity conservation and human safety (Moritz et al. 2014; Gharun 
et al. 2017).
Cross-Chapter Box 3, Figure 1 |  The probability of low-fi re regions becoming fi re prone (positive values), or of fi re-prone areas changing to 
a low-fi re state (negative values) between 1971–2000 and 2071–2100 based on eight-Earth system model (ESM) ensembles, two Shared Socio-economic 
Pathways (SSPs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Light grey: areas where at least one ensemble simulation predicts a positive and one 
a negative change (lack of agreement). Dark grey: area with >50% past or future cropland. Fire-prone areas are defi ned as having a fi re frequency of >0.01 yr–1, 
(a) RCP4.5 emissions with SSP3 demographics, and (b) RCP8.5 emissions with SSP5 demographics (Knorr et al. 2016a).
In summary, climate change is playing an increasing role in determining wildfi re regimes alongside human activity (medium confi dence), 
with future climate variability expected to enhance the risk and severity of wildfi res in many biomes, such as tropical rainforests (high 
confi dence). Fire weather seasons have lengthened globally between 1979 and 2013 (low confi dence). Global land area burned has 
declined in recent decades, mainly due to less burning in grasslands and savannas (high confi dence). While drought remains the 
dominant driver of fi re emissions, there has recently been increased fi re activity in some tropical and temperate regions during normal 
to wetter-than-average years due to warmer temperatures that increase vegetation fl ammability (medium confi dence). The boreal 
zone is also experiencing larger and more frequent fi res, and this may increase under a warmer climate (medium confi dence).

2.3 
Greenhouse gas fluxes between 
land and atmosphere
Land is simultaneously a source and sink for several GHGs. Moreover, 
both natural and anthropogenic processes determine fluxes of GHGs, 
making it difficult to separate ‘anthropogenic’ and ‘non-anthropogenic’ 
emissions and removals. A meeting report by the IPCC (2010) divided 
the processes responsible for fluxes from land into three categories: 
(i) the direct effects of anthropogenic activity due to changing land 
cover and land management, (ii) the indirect effects of anthropogenic 
environmental change, such as climate change, carbon dioxide (CO2) 
fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, and (iii) natural climate variability 
and natural disturbances (e.g.,  wildfires, windrow, disease). The 
meeting report (IPCC 2010) noted that it was impossible with any 
direct observation to separate direct anthropogenic effects from 
non-anthropogenic (indirect and natural) effects in the land sector. 
As a result, different approaches and methods for estimating the 
anthropogenic fluxes have been developed by different communities 
to suit their individual purposes, tools and data availability.
The major GHGs exchanged between land and the atmosphere 
discussed in this chapter are CO2 (Section 2.3.1), methane (CH4) 
(Section 2.3.2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Section 2.3.3). We estimate 
the total emissions from AFOLU to be responsible for approximately 
23% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions over the period 
2007–2016 (Smith et  al.  2013a; Ciais et  al.  2013a) (Table 2.2). 
The estimate is similar to that reported in AR5 (high confidence), 
with slightly more than half these emissions coming as non-CO2 
GHGs from agriculture. Emissions from AFOLU have remained 
relatively constant since AR4, although their relative contribution 
to anthropogenic emissions has decreased due to increases in 
emissions from the energy sector.

5 The natural response of land to human-induced environmental changes is the response of vegetation and soils to environmental changes such as increasing atmospheric CO2 
concentration, nitrogen deposition, and climate change. The estimate shown represents the average from Dynamic Global Vegetation Models.
6 All values expressed in units of CO2-eq are based on AR5 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP) values without climate-carbon feedbacks (N2O = 265; CH4 = 28). Note 
that the GWP has been used across fossil fuel and biogenic sources of methane. If a higher GWP for fossil fuel CH4 (30 per AR5), then total anthropogenic CH4 emissions 
expressed in CO2-eq would be 2% greater.

2.3.1 
Carbon dioxide
This section is divided into four sub-sections (Figure 2.4): (i) the total 
net fl ux of CO2 between land and atmosphere, (ii) the contributions 
of AFOLU fl uxes and the non-AFOLU land sink to that total net CO2 
fl ux, (iii) the gross emissions and removals comprising the net AFOLU 
fl ux, and (iv) the gross emissions and removals comprising the land 
sink. Emissions to the atmosphere are positive; removals from the 
atmosphere are negative.
2.3.1.1 
The total net fl ux of CO2 between land 
and atmosphere 
The net effects of all anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic processes 
on managed and unmanaged land result in a net removal of CO2 from 
the atmosphere (high confi dence). This total net land-atmosphere 
removal (defi ned here as the total net land ﬂ ux) is estimated to 
have averaged 6.0 ± 2.0 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely range) from 2007–2016 
(Table 2.3). The estimate is determined from summing the AFOLU and 
non-AFOLU fl uxes due to transient climate change, CO2 fertilisation 
and nitrogen deposition calculated by models in the global carbon 
budget (Le Quéré et al. 2018), and is consistent with inverse modelling 
techniques based on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and air transport 
(range: 5.1–8.8 GtCO2 yr–1) (Peylin et al. 2013; Van Der Laan-Luijkx 
et al. 2017; Saeki and Patra 2017; Le Quéré et al. 2018) (see Box 2.2 
for methods). A recent inverse analysis, considering carbon transport 
in rivers and oceans, found a net fl ux of CO2 for land within this range, 
but a lower source from southern lands and a lower sink in northern 
lands (Resplandy et al. 2018). 
The net removal of CO2 by land has generally increased over 
the last 60 years in proportion to total emissions of CO2 (high 
confi dence). Although land has been a net sink for CO2 since around 
the middle of last century, it was a net source to the atmosphere 
before that time, primarily as a result of emissions from AFOLU 
(Le Quéré et al. 2018).
2.3.1.2 
Separation of the total net land fl ux into AFOLU 
fl uxes and the land sink
The total net fl ux of carbon between land and the atmosphere can 
be divided into fl uxes due to direct human activities (i.e., AFOLU) 
and fl uxes due to indirect anthropogenic and natural effects 
(i.e.,  the  land sink) (Table 2.3). These two components are 
less certain than their sums, the total net fl ux of CO2 between 
atmosphere and land. The land sink, estimated with DGVMs, is least 
certain (Figure 2.5). 
Fluxes attributed to AFOLU 
The modelled AFOLU fl ux was a net emission of 5.2 ± 2.6 
GtCO2 yr–1 (likely range) for 2007–2016, approximately 13% of total 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions (Le Quéré et al. 2018) (Table 2.3). This 
net fl ux was due to direct anthropogenic activities, predominately 
tropical deforestation, but also afforestation/reforestation, and fl uxes 
due to forest management (e.g., wood harvest) and other types of 
land management, as well as peatland drainage and burning. The 
AFOLU fl ux is the mean of two estimates from bookkeeping models 
(Hansis et al. 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017), and this estimated

mean is consistent with the mean obtained from an assemblage of 
DGVMs (Le Quéré et al. 2018) (Box 2.2 and Figure 2.5), although 
not all individual DGMVs include the same types of land use. Net 
CO2 emissions from AFOLU have been relatively constant since 1900. 
AFOLU emissions were the dominant anthropogenic emissions until 
around the middle of the last century when fossil fuel emissions 
became dominant (Le Quéré et  al. 2018). AFOLU activities have 
resulted in emissions of CO2 over recent decades (robust evidence, 
high agreement) although there is a wide range of estimates from 
different methods and approaches (Smith et al. 2014; Houghton et al. 
2012; Gasser and Ciais 2013; Pongratz et  al. 2014; Tubiello et  al. 
2015; Grassi et al. 2018) (Box 2.2, Figure 2.5 and Figure 2.7). 
DGVMs and one bookkeeping model (Hansis et al. 2015) used spatially 
explicit, harmonised land-use change data (LUH2) (Hurtt et al. 2017) 
based on HYDE 3.2. The HYDE data, in turn, are based on changes 
in the areas of croplands and pastures. In contrast, the Houghton 
bookkeeping approach (Houghton and Nassikas 2017) used primarily 
changes in forest area from the FAO Forest Resource Assessment 
(FAO 2015) and FAOSTAT to determine changes in land use. To the 
extent that forests are cleared for land uses other than crops and 
pastures, estimates from Houghton and Nassikas (2017, 2018) are 
higher than estimates from DGMVs. In addition, both bookkeeping 
models (Hansis et al. 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017) included 
estimates of carbon emissions in Southeast Asia from peat burning 
from GFED4s (Randerson et  al. 2015) and from peat drainage 
(Hooijer et al. 2010). 
Satellite-based estimates of CO2 emissions from losses of tropical 
forests during 2000–2010 corroborate the modelled emissions 
but are quite variable; 4.8 GtCO2 yr–1 (Tyukavina et  al. 2015), 
3.0 GtCO2 yr–1 (Harris et al. 2015), 3.2 GtCO2 yr–1 (Achard et al. 2014) 
and 1.6 GtCO2  yr–1 (Baccini et  al. 2017). Differences in estimates 
can be explained to a large extent by the different approaches used. 
For example, the analysis by Tyukavina et al. (2015) led to a higher 
estimate because they used a finer spatial resolution. Three of the 
estimates considered losses in forest area and ignored degradation 
and regrowth of forests. Baccini et al. (2017) in contrast, included 
both losses and gains in forest area and losses and gains of carbon 
within forests (i.e., forest degradation and growth). The four remote 
sensing studies cited above also reported committed emissions; in 
essence, all of the carbon lost from deforestation was assumed to 
be released to the atmosphere in the year of deforestation. In reality, 
only some of the carbon in trees is released immediately to the 
atmosphere at the time of deforestation. The unburned portion is 
transferred to woody debris and wood products. Both bookkeeping 
models and DGVMs account for the delayed emissions in growth and 
decomposition. Finally, the satellite-based estimates do not include 
changes in soil carbon.
In addition to differences in land-cover data sets between models 
and satellites, there are many other methodological reasons for 
differences (Houghton et al. 2012; Gasser and Ciais 2013; Pongratz 
et  al. 2014; Tubiello et  al. 2015) (Box 2.2). There are different 
definitions of land-cover type, including forest (e.g., FAO uses a tree 
cover threshold for forests of 10%, Tyukavina et al. (2017) used 25%), 
different estimates of biomass and soil carbon density (MgC ha–1), 
different approaches to tracking emissions through time (legacy 
effects) and different types of activity included (e.g., forest harvest, 
peatland drainage and fires). Most DGVMS only recently (since AR5) 
included forest management processes, such as tree harvesting and 
land clearing for shifting cultivation, leading to larger estimates of 
CO2 emissions than when these processes are not considered (Arneth 
et al. 2017; Erb et al. 2018). Grazing management has likewise been 
found to have large effects (Sanderman et  al. 2017), and is not 
included in most DGVMs (Pugh et al. 2015; Pongratz et al., 2018). 
Nationally reported greenhouse gas inventories versus  
global model estimates
There are large differences globally between estimates of net 
anthropogenic land-atmosphere fluxes of CO2 from national GHGIs 
and from global models, and the same is true in many regions 
(Figure 2.5). Fluxes reported to the UNFCCC through country GHGIs 
were noted as about 4.3 GtCO2 yr–1 lower (Grassi et al. 2018) than 
estimates from the bookkeeping model (Houghton et al. 2012) used 
in the carbon budget for AR5 (Ciais et al. 2013a). The anthropogenic 
emissions of CO2 from AFOLU reported in countries’ GHG inventories 
were 0.1 ± 1.0 GtCO2 yr–1 globally during 2005–2014 (Grassi 
et  al. 2018) much lower than emission estimates from the two 
global bookkeeping models of 5.1 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely range) 
over the same time period (Le Quéré et  al. 2018). Transparency 
and comparability in estimates can support measuring, reporting 
and verifying GHG fluxes under the UNFCCC, and also the global

F igure 2.6 |  Summary of the main conceptual differences between GHG Inventories and global models in considering what is the ‘anthropogenic land 
CO2 fl ux’. Adapted from Grassi et al. (2018), effects of key processes on the land fl ux as defi ned by IPCC (2010) including where these effects occur (in managed and/or 
unmanaged lands) and how these effects are captured in (a) bookkeeping models that do not explicitly model the effects of environmental change (although some is implicitly 
captured in data on carbon densities and growth and decay rates), (b) DGVMs that include the effects of environmental change on all lands, and run the models with and 
without land use change to diagnose ‘land use change’. The ‘land sink’ is then conceptually assumed to be a natural response of land to the anthropogenic perturbation of 
environmental change, DGVMs include the effects of inter-annual climate variability, and some include fi res but no other natural disturbances, and (c) GHG Inventories reported 
by countries to the UNFCCC that report all fl uxes in areas the countries defi ne as ‘managed land’ but do not report unmanaged land. This is the CO2 fl ux due to Land Use Land 
Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) which is a part of the overall AFOLU fl ux. The area of land considered as managed in the inventories is greater than that considered as subject 
to direct management activities (harvest and regrowth) in the models.

stocktake, which will assess globally the progress towards achieving 
the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. These differences can 
be reconciled largely by taking account of the different approaches 
to defining ‘anthropogenic’ in terms of different areas of land and 
treatment of indirect environmental change (Grassi et al. 2018). 
To date there has been one study that quantitatively reconciles the 
global model estimates with GHGIs (Grassi et al. 2018). The separation 
of anthropogenic from non-anthropogenic effects is impossible with 
direct observation (IPCC 2010). The different approaches of models 
and GHGIs to estimating anthropogenic emissions and removals 
are shown in (Figure 2.6). The difficulty is that indirect effects of 
environmental changes (e.g., climate change and rising atmospheric 
CO2) affect both manged and unmanaged lands, and some approaches 
treat these as anthropogenic while others do not. Bookkeeping 
models (e.g., Houghton and Nassikas 2017) attempt to estimate the 
fluxes of CO2 driven by direct anthropogenic effects alone. DGVMs 
model the indirect environmental effects of climate and CO2. If the 
indirect effects happen on land experiencing anthropogenic land 
cover change or management (harvest and regrowth), DGVMs 
treat this as anthropogenic. Country GHGIs separately report fluxes 
due to land conversion (e.g., forests to croplands) and fluxes due 
to land management (e.g., forest land remaining forest land). The 
‘managed land proxy’ is used as a pragmatic approach to estimate 
anthropogenic fluxes on managed lands, whereby countries define 
the areas they consider managed and include all of the emissions 
and removals that occur on those lands. Emissions and removals are 
caused simultaneously by direct, indirect and natural drivers and are 
captured in the reporting, which often relies on inventories. 
Grassi et  al. (2018) demonstrated that estimates of CO2 emissions 
from global models and from nationally reported GHGIs were similar 
for deforestation and afforestation, but different for managed forests. 
Countries generally reported larger areas of managed forests than the 
models and the carbon removals by these managed forests were also 
larger. The flux due to indirect effects on managed lands was quantified 
using post-processing of results from DGVMs, looking at the indirect 
effects of CO2 and climate change on secondary forest areas. The derived 
DGVM indirect managed forest flux was found to account for most of 
the difference between the bookkeeping models and the inventories.
Regional differences
Figure 2.7 shows regional differences in emissions due to AFOLU. 
Recent increases in deforestation rates in some tropical countries have 
been partially balanced by increases in forest area in India, China, the 
USA and Europe (FAO-FRA 2015). The trend in emissions from AFOLU 
since the 1990s is uncertain because some data suggest a declining rate 
of deforestation (FAO-FRA 2015), while data from satellites suggest 
an increasing rate (Kim 2014; Hansen et al. 2012). The disagreement 
results in part from differences in the definition of forest and 
approaches to estimating deforestation. The FAO defines deforestation 
as the conversion of forest to another land use (FAO-FRA 2015), while 
the measurement of forest loss by satellite may include wood harvests 
(forests remaining forests) and natural disturbances that are not 
directly caused by anthropogenic activity (e.g., forest mortality from 
droughts and fires). Trends in anthropogenic and natural disturbances 
may be in opposite directions. For example, recent drought-induced 
fires in the Amazon have increased the emissions from wildfires at 
the same time that emissions from anthropogenic deforestation have 
declined (Aragão et al. 2018). Furthermore, there have been advances 
since AR5 in estimating the GHG effects of different types of forest 
management (e.g., Valade et al. 2017). Overall, there is robust evidence 
and high agreement for a net loss of forest area and tree cover in the 
tropics and a net gain, mainly of secondary forests and sustainably 
managed forests, in the temperate and boreal zones (Chapter 1).
Processes responsible for the land sink
Just over half of total net anthropogenic CO2 emissions (AFOLU and 
fossil fuels) were taken up by oceanic and land sinks (robust evidence, 
high agreement) (Table 2.3). The land sink was referred to in AR5 
as the ‘residual terrestrial flux’, as it was not estimated directly, but 
calculated by difference from the other directly estimated fluxes in 
the budget (Table 2.3). In the 2018 budget (Le Quéré et al. 2018), 
the land sink term was instead estimated directly by DGVMs, leaving 
a budget imbalance of 2.2 GtCO2 yr–1 (sources overestimated or sinks 
underestimated). The budget imbalance may result from variations 
in oceanic uptake or from uncertainties in fossil fuel or AFOLU 
emissions, as well as from land processes not included in DGVMs.
The land sink is thought to be driven largely by the indirect effects of 
environmental change (e.g., climate change, increased atmospheric 
CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition) on unmanaged and managed 
lands (robust evidence, high agreement). The land sink has generally 
increased since 1900 and was a net sink of 11.7 ± 3.7 GtCO2 yr–1 
during the period 2008–2017 (Table 2.3), absorbing 29% of global 
anthropogenic emissions of CO2. The land sink has slowed the rise 
in global land-surface air temperature by 0.09 ± 0.02°C since 1982 
(medium confidence) (Zeng et al. 2017). 
The rate of CO2 removal by land accelerated from –0.026 ± 0.24 
GtCO2 yr–1 during the warming period (1982–1998) to –0.436 ± 0.260 
GtCO2 yr–1 during the warming hiatus (1998–2012). One explanation 
is that respiration rates were lower during the warming hiatus 
(Ballantyne et  al. 2017). However, the lower rate of growth in 
atmospheric CO2 during the warming hiatus may have resulted, not 
from lower rates of respiration, but from declining emissions from 
AFOLU (lower rates of tropical deforestation and increased forest 
growth in northern mid-latitudes) (Piao et al. 2018). Changes in the 
growth rate of atmospheric CO2, by themselves, do not identify the 
processes responsible and the cause of the variation is uncertain. 
While year-to-year variability in the indirect land sink is high in 
response to climate variability, DGVM fluxes are influenced far more 
on decadal timescales by CO2 fertilisation. A DGVM intercomparison 
(Sitch et al. 2015) for 1990–2009 found that CO2 fertilisation alone 
contributed a mean global removal of –10.54 ± 3.68 GtCO2 yr–1 
(trend –0.444 ± 0.202 GtCO2 yr–1). Data from forest inventories 
around the world corroborate the modelled land sink (Pan et  al. 
2011). The geographic distribution of the non-AFOLU land sink is 
less certain. While it seems to be distributed globally, its distribution 
between the tropics and non-tropics is estimated to be between 1:1 
(Pan et al. 2011) and 1:2 (Houghton et al. 2018).

because reporting in many developing countries became more consistent/reliable after 2005. For more details on methods see Box 2.2.
As described in Box 2.3, rising CO2 concentrations have a fertilising 
effect on land, while climate has mixed effects; for example, rising 
temperature increases respiration rates and may enhance or reduce 
photosynthesis depending on location and season, while longer 
growing seasons might allow for higher carbon uptake. However, 
these processes are not included in DGVMs, which may account for 
at least some of the land sink. For example, a decline in the global 
area burned by fires each year (Andela et al. 2017) accounts for 
an estimated net sink (and/or reduced emissions) of 0.5 GtCO2 yr–1 
(limited evidence, medium agreement) (Arora and Melton  2018). 
Boreal forests represent an exception to this decline (Kelly et  al. 
2013). The reduction in burning not only reduces emissions, but also 
allows more growth of recovering forests. There is also an estimated 
net carbon sink of about the same magnitude (0.5 GtCO2 yr–1) as 
a result of soil erosion from agricultural lands and redeposition 
in anaerobic environments where respiration is reduced (limited 
evidence, low agreement) (Wang et  al. 2017d). A recent study 
attributes an increase in land carbon to a longer-term (1860–2005) 
aerosol-induced cooling (Zhang et al. 2019). Recent evidence also 
suggests that DGVMs and ESMs underestimate the effects of

drought on CO2 emissions (Humphrey et al. 2018; Green et al. 2019; 
Kolus et al. 2019).
2.3.1.3 
Gross emissions and removals contributing 
to AFOLU emissions
The modelled AFOLU flux of 5.5 ± 3.7 GtCO2 yr–1 over the period 
2008–2017 represents a net value. It consists of both gross emissions 
of CO2 from deforestation, forest degradation and the oxidation of 
wood products, as well as gross removals of CO2 in forests and soils 
recovering from harvests and agricultural abandonment (Figure 2.4). 
The uncertainty of these gross fluxes is high because few studies 
report gross fluxes from AFOLU. Houghton and Nassikas (2017) 
estimated gross emissions to be as high as 20.2 GtCO2 yr–1 (limited 
evidence, low agreement) (Figure 2.4), and even this may be an 
underestimate because the land-use change data used from FAOSTAT 
(Tubiello et al. 2013) is itself a net of all changes within a country. 
Gross emissions and removals of CO2 result from rotational uses 
of land, such as wood harvest and shifting cultivation, including 
regrowth. These gross fluxes are more informative for assessing 
the timing and potential for mitigation than estimates of net fluxes, 
because the gross fluxes include a more complete accounting of 
individual activities. Gross emissions from rotational land use in the 
tropics are approximately 37% of total CO2 emissions, rather than 
14%, as suggested by net AFOLU emissions (Houghton and Nassikas 
2018). Further, if the forest is replanted or allowed to regrow, gross 
removals of nearly the same magnitude would be expected to 
continue for decades. 
2.3.1.4 
Gross emissions and removals contributing 
to the non-anthropogenic land sink
The net land sink averaged 11.2 ± 2.6 GtCO2 yr–1 (likely range) over 
2007–2016 (Table 2.3.2), but its gross components have not been 
estimated at the global level. There are many studies that suggest 
increasing emissions of carbon are due to indirect environmental 
effects and natural disturbance, for example, temperature-induced 
increases in respiration rates (Bond-Lamberty et al. 2018), increased 
tree mortality (Brienen et  al. 2015; Berdanier and Clark 2016; 
McDowell et al. 2018) and thawing permafrost (Schuur et al. 2015). 
The global carbon budget indicates that land and ocean sinks 
have increased over the last six decades in proportion to total CO2 
emissions (Le Quéré et al. 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement). 
That means that any emissions must have been balanced by even 
larger removals (likely driven by CO2 fertilisation, climate change, 
nitrogen deposition, erosion and redeposition of soil carbon, 
a reduction in areas burned, aerosol-induced cooling and changes in 
natural disturbances) (Box 2.3).
Climate change is expected to impact terrestrial biogeochemical 
cycles via an array of complex feedback mechanisms that will act to 
either enhance or decrease future CO2 emissions from land. Because 
the gross emissions and removals from environmental changes 
are not constrained at present, the balance of future positive and 
negative feedbacks remains uncertain. Estimates from climate models 
in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) exhibit large 
differences for different carbon and nitrogen cycle feedbacks and how 
they change in a warming climate (Anav et al. 2013; Friedlingstein et al. 
2006; Friedlingstein, et al. 2014). The differences are in large part due to 
the uncertainty regarding how primary productivity and soil respiration 
will respond to environmental changes, with many of the models 
not even agreeing on the sign of change. Furthermore, many models do 
not include a nitrogen cycle, which may limit the CO2 fertilisation effect 
in the future (Box 2.3). There is an increasing amount of observational 
data available and methods to constrain models (e.g., Cox et al. 2013; 
Prentice, et al., 2015) which can reduce uncertainty.
2.3.1.5 
Potential impact of mitigation on 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations
If CO2 concentrations decline in the future as a result of low 
emissions and large negative emissions, the global land and 
ocean sinks are expected to weaken (or even reverse). The oceans 
are expected to release CO2 back to the atmosphere when the 
concentration declines (Ciais et  al. 2013a; Jones et  al. 2016). 
This means that to maintain atmospheric CO2 and temperature 
at low levels, both the excess CO2 from the atmosphere and the 
CO2 progressively outgassed from the ocean and land sinks will 
need to be removed. This outgassing from the land and ocean 
sinks is called the ‘rebound effect’ of the global carbon cycle 
(Ciais et  al. 2013a). It will reduce the effectiveness of negative 
emissions and increase the deployment level needed to achieve 
a climate stabilisation target (Jackson et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2016) 
(limited evidence, high agreement). 
2.3.2

2.3.2.1 
Atmospheric trends
In 2017, the globally averaged atmospheric concentration of CH4 
was 1850 ± 1 ppbv (Figure 2.8A). Systematic measurements of 
atmospheric CH4 concentrations began in the mid-1980s and 
trends show a steady increase between the mid-1980s and early-
1990s, slower growth thereafter until 1999, a period of no growth 
between 1999 and 2006, followed by a resumption of growth in 
2007. The growth rates show very high inter-annual variability with 
a negative trend from the beginning of the measurement period until 
about 2006, followed by a rapid recovery and continued high inter-
annual variability through 2017 (Figure 2.8B). The growth rate has 
been higher over the past 4 years (high confidence) (Nisbet et al. 
2019). The trend in δ13C-CH4 prior to 2000 with less depleted ratios 
indicated that the increase in atmospheric concentrations was due 
to thermogenic (fossil) CH4 emissions; the reversal of this trend after 
2007 indicates a shift to biogenic sources (Figure 2.8C). 
Understanding the underlying causes of temporal variation in 
atmospheric CH4 concentrations is an active area of research. Several 
studies concluded that inter-annual variability of CH4 growth was 
driven by variations in natural emissions from wetlands (Rice et al. 
2016; Bousquet et al. 2006; Bousquet et al. 2011). These modelling 
efforts concluded that tropical wetlands were responsible for between 
50 and 100% of the inter-annual fluctuations and the renewed 
158

growth in atmospheric concentrations after 2007. However, results 
were inconsistent for the magnitude and geographic distribution of 
the wetland sources between the models. Pison et al. (2013) used 
two atmospheric inversion models and the ORCHIDEE model and 
found greater uncertainty in the role of wetlands in inter-annual 
variability between 1990 and 2009 and during the 1999–2006 
pause. Poulter et  al. (2017) used several biogeochemical models 
and inventory-based wetland area data to show that wetland CH4 
emissions increases in the boreal zone have been offset by decreases 
in the tropics, and concluded that wetlands have not contributed 
significantly to renewed atmospheric CH4 growth.
The models cited above assumed that atmospheric hydroxyl radical 
(OH) sink over the period analysed did not vary. OH reacts with CH4 
as the first step toward oxidation to CO2. In global CH4 budgets, 
the atmospheric OH sink has been difficult to quantify because its 
short lifetime (about 1 second) and its distribution is controlled by 
precursor species that have non-linear interactions (Taraborrelli et al., 
2012; Prather et al., 2017). Understanding of the atmospheric OH 
sink has evolved recently. The development of credible time series 
of methyl chloroform (MCF: CH3CCl3) observations offered a way 
to understand temporal dynamics of OH abundance and applying 
this to global budgets further weakened the argument for the role 
of wetlands in determining temporal trends since 1990. Several 
authors used the MCF approach and concluded that changes in the 
atmospheric OH sink explained a large portion of the suppression 
in global CH4 concentrations relative to the pre-1999 trend 
(Turner et al. 2017; Rigby et al. 2013; McNorton et al. 2016). These 
studies could not reject the null hypothesis that OH has remained 
constant in recent decades and they did not suggest a mechanism

for the inferred OH concentration changes (Nisbet et al. 2019). Nicely 
et al. (2018) used a mechanistic approach and demonstrated that 
variation in atmospheric OH was much lower than what MCF studies 
claimed that positive trends in OH due to the effects of water vapour, 
nitrogen oxides (NOx), tropospheric ozone and expansion of the 
tropical Hadley cells offsets the decrease in OH that is expected from 
increasing atmospheric CH4 concentrations.
The depletion of δ13Catm beginning in 2009 could be due to changes 
in several sources. Decreased fire emissions combined with increased 
tropical wetland emissions compared to earlier years could explain 
the δ13C perturbations to atmospheric CH4 sources (Worden et al. 
2017; Schaefer et  al. 2016). However, because tropical wetland 
emissions are higher in the southern hemisphere, and the remote 
sensing observations show that CH4 emissions increases are largely 
in the north tropics (Bergamaschi et al. 2013; Melton et al. 2013; 
Houweling et  al. 2014), an increased wetland source does not 
fit well with the southern hemisphere δ13C observations. New 
evidence shows that tropical wetland CH4 emissions are significantly 
underestimated, perhaps by a factor of 2, because estimates do 
not account for release by tree stems (Pangala et al. 2017). Several 
authors have concluded that agriculture is a more probable source 
of increased emissions, particularly from rice and livestock in the 
tropics, which is consistent with inventory data (Wolf et al. 2017; 
Patra et al. 2016; Schaefer et al. 2016).
The importance of fugitive emissions in the global atmospheric 
accumulation rate is growing (medium evidence, high agreement). 
The increased production of natural gas in the US from the mid 
2000s is of particular interest because it coincides with renewed 
atmospheric CH4 growth (Rice et al. 2016; Hausmann et al. 2015). 
Reconciling increased fugitive emissions with increased isotopic 
depletion of atmospheric CH4 indicates that there are likely multiple 
changes in emissions and sinks that affect atmospheric accumulation 
(medium confidence).
With respect to atmospheric CH4 growth rates, we conclude 
that there is significant and ongoing accumulation of CH4 in the 
atmosphere (very high confidence). The reason for the pause in 
growth rates and subsequent renewed growth is at least partially 
associated with land use and land use change. Evidence that 
variation in the atmospheric OH sink plays a role in the year-to-year 
variation of the CH4 is accumulating, but results are contradictory 
(medium evidence, low agreement) and refining this evidence is 
constrained by lack of long-term isotopic measurements at remote 
sites, particularly in the tropics. Fugitive emissions likely contribute to 
the renewed growth after 2006 (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Additionally, the recent depletion trend of 13C isotope in the 
atmosphere indicates that growth in biogenic sources explains part 
of the current growth and that biogenic sources make up a larger 
proportion of the source mix compared to the period before 1997 
(robust evidence, high agreement). In agreement with the findings 
of AR5, we conclude that wetlands are important drivers of inter-
annual variability and current growth rates (medium evidence, high 
agreement). Ruminants and the expansion of rice cultivation are 
also important contributors to the current growth trend (medium 
evidence, high agreement). 
2.3.2.2 
Land use effects
Agricultural emissions are predominantly from enteric fermentation 
and rice, with manure management and waste burning contributing 
small amounts (Figure 2.9). Since 2000, livestock production has 
been responsible for 33% of total global emissions and 66% of 
agricultural emissions (EDGAR 4.3.2 database, May 2018; USEPA 
2012; Tubiello et al. 2014; Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2017b). Asia has 
the largest livestock emissions (37%) and emissions in the region 
have been growing by around 2% per year over the same period. 
North America is responsible for 26% and emissions are stable; 
Europe is responsible for around 8% of emissions, and these are 
decreasing slightly (<1% per year). Africa is responsible for 14%, but 
emissions are growing fastest in this region at around 2.5% y–1. In 
Latin America and the Caribbean, livestock emissions are decreasing 
at around 1.6% per year and the region makes up 16% of emissions. 
Rice emissions are responsible for about 24% of agricultural emissions 
and 89% of these are from Asia. Rice emissions are increasing by 
0.9% per year in that region. These trends are predicted to continue 
through 2030 (USEPA 2013).
Upland soils are a net sink of atmospheric CH4, but soils both produce 
and consume the gas. On the global scale, climatic zone, soil texture 
and land cover have an important effect on CH4 uptake in upland 
soils (Tate 2015; Yu et al. 2017; Dutaur and Verchot 2007). Boreal 
soils take up less than temperate or tropical soils, coarse textured 
soils take up more CH4 than medium and fine textured soils, and 
forests take up more than other ecosystems. Low levels of nitrogen 
fertilisation or atmospheric deposition can affect the soil microbial 
community and stimulate soil CH4 uptake in nitrogen-limited soils, 
while higher fertilisation rates decrease uptake (Edwards et  al. 
2005; Zhuang et  al., 2013). Globally, nitrogen fertilisation on 
agricultural lands may have suppressed CH4 oxidation by as much 
as 26 Tg between 1998 and 2004 (low confidence, low agreement) 
(Zhuang et al., 2013). The effect of nitrogen additions is cumulative 
and repeated fertilisation events have progressively greater 
suppression effects (robust evidence, high agreement) (Tate 2015). 
Other factors such as higher temperatures, increased atmospheric 
concentrations and changes in rainfall patterns stimulate soil CH4 
consumption in unfertilised ecosystems. Several studies (Yu et al. 
2017; Xu et al. 2016; Curry 2009) have shown that globally, uptake 
has been increasing during the second half of the 20th century and 
is expected to continue to increase by as much as 1 Tg in the 21st 
century, particularly in forests and grasslands (medium evidence, 
high agreement). 
Northern peatlands (40–70°N) are a significant source of atmospheric 
CH4, emitting about 48 TgCH4, or about 10% of the total emissions 
to the atmosphere (Zhuang et al. 2006; Wuebbles and Hayhoe 2002). 
CH4 emissions from natural northern peatlands are highly variable, 
with the highest rate from fens (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Peatland management and restoration alters the exchange of CH4 with 
the atmosphere (medium evidence, high agreement). Management of 
peat soils typically converts them from CH4 sources to sinks (Augustin 
et  al. 2011; Strack and Waddington 2008; Abdalla et  al. 2016) 
(robust evidence, high agreement). While restoration decreases CO2 
emissions (Section 4.9.4), CH4 emissions often increase relative to the 
160

drained conditions (robust evidence, high agreement) (Osterloh et al. 
2018; Christen et al. 2016; Koskinen et al. 2016; Tuittila et al. 2000; 
Vanselow-Algan et al. 2015; Abdalla et al. 2016). Drained peatlands 
are usually considered to be negligible methane sources, but they 
emit CH4 under wet weather conditions and from drainage ditches 
(Drösler et al. 2013; Sirin et al. 2012). While ditches cover only a small 
percentage of the drained area, emissions can be suffi ciently high that 
drained peatlands emit comparable CH4 as undrained ones (medium 
evidence, medium agreement) (Sirin et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 2016). 
Because of the large uncertainty in the tropical peatland area, 
estimates of the global fl ux are highly uncertain. A meta-analysis of 
the effect of conversion of primary forest to rice production showed 
that emissions increased by a factor of four (limited evidence, high 
agreement) (Hergoualc’h and Verchot, 2012). For land uses that 
required drainage, emissions decreased by a factor of three (limited 
evidence, high agreement). There are no representative measurements 
of emissions from drainage ditches in tropical peatlands. 
2.3.3 
Nitrous oxide
2.3.3.1 
Atmospheric trends
The atmospheric abundance of N2O has increased since 1750, from 
a pre-industrial concentration of 270 ppbv to 330 ppbv in 2017 
(high agreement, robust evidence) (US National Oceanographic 
and Atmospheric Agency, Earth Systems Research Laboratory) 
(Figure  2.10). The rate of increase has also increased, from 
approximately 0.15 ppbv yr–1 100 years ago, to 0.85 ppbv yr–1 over 
the period 2001–2015 (Wells et al. 2018). Atmospheric N2O isotopic 
composition (14/15N) was relatively constant during the pre-industrial 
period (Prokopiou et al. 2018) and shows a decrease in the δ15N as 
the N2O mixing ratio in the atmosphere has increased between 1940 
and 2005. This recent decrease indicates that terrestrial sources are 
the primary driver of increasing trends and marine sources contribute 
around 25% (Snider  et  al. 2015). Microbial denitrifi cation and 
nitrifi cation processes are responsible for more than 80% of total 
global N2O emissions, which includes natural soils, agriculture and 
oceans, with the remainder coming from non-biological sources such 
as biomass burning and fossil-fuel combustion (Fowler et al. 2015). The 
isotopic trend also indicates a shift from denitrifi cation to nitrifi cation 
as the primary source of N2O as a result of the use of synthetic nitrogen 
fertiliser (high evidence, high agreement) (Park et  al. 2012; Toyoda 
et al. 2013; Snider et al. 2015; Prokopiou et al. 2018).
The three independent sources of N2O emissions estimates from 
agriculture at global, regional and national levels are: USEPA, EDGAR 
and FAOSTAT (USEPA 2013; Tubiello et al. 2015; Janssens-Maenhout 
et al. 2017a). EDGAR and FAOSTAT have temporal resolution beyond 
2005 and these databases compare well with national inventory 
data (Figure 2.10). USEPA has historical estimates through 2005 and 
projections thereafter. The independent data use IPCC methods, with 
Tier 1 emission factors and national reporting of activity data. Tier 2 
approaches are also available based on top-down and bottom-up 
approaches. Recent estimates using inversion modelling and process

models estimate total annual global N2O emissions of 16.1–18.7 
(bottom-up) and 15.9–17.7 TgN (top-down), demonstrating relatively 
close agreement (Thompson et al. 2014). Agriculture is the largest 
source and has increased with extensification and intensification. 
Recent modelling estimates of terrestrial sources show a higher 
emissions range that is slightly more constrained than what was 
reported in AR5: approximately 9 (7–11) TgN2O-N yr–1 (Saikawa et al. 
2014; Tian et al. 2016) compared to 6.6 (3.3–9.0) TgN2O-N yr–1 (Ciais 
et al. 2013a). Estimates of marine N2O emissions are between 2.5 and 
4.6 TgN2O-N yr–1 (Buitenhuis et al., 2018; Saikawa et al., 2014). 
To conclude, N2O is continuing to accumulate in the atmosphere at 
an increasingly higher rate (very high confidence), driven primarily by 
increases in manure production and synthetic nitrogen fertiliser use 
from the mid-20th century onwards (high confidence). Findings since 
AR5 have constrained regional and global estimates of annual N2O 
emissions and improved our understanding of the spatio-temporal 
dynamics of N2O emissions, including soil rewetting and freeze-thaw 
cycles which are important determinants of total annual emission 
fluxes in some regions (medium confidence).
2.3.3.2 
Land use effects
Agriculture is responsible for approximately two-thirds of N2O 
emissions (robust evidence, high agreement) (Janssens-Maenhout 
et al. 2017b). Total emissions from this sector are the sum of direct and 
indirect emissions. Direct emissions from soils are the result of mineral 
fertiliser and manure application, manure management, deposition of 
crop residues, cultivation of organic soils and inorganic nitrogen inputs 
through biological nitrogen fixation. Indirect emissions come from 
increased warming, enrichment of downstream water bodies from 
runoff, and downwind nitrogen deposition on soils. The main driver 
of N2O emissions in croplands is a lack of synchronisation between 
crop nitrogen demand and soil nitrogen supply, with approximately 
50% of nitrogen applied to agricultural land not taken up by the crop 
(Zhang et al. 2017). Cropland soils emit over 3 TgN2O-N yr–1 (medium 
evidence, high agreement) (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2017b; Saikawa 
et al. 2014). Regional inverse modelling studies show larger tropical 
emissions than the inventory approaches and they show increases 
in N2O emissions from the agricultural sector in South Asia, Central 
America, and South America (Saikawa et al. 2014; Wells et al. 2018). 
Emissions of N2O from pasturelands and rangelands have increased 
by as much as 80% since 1960 due to increased manure production 
and deposition (robust evidence, high agreement) (de Klein et  al. 
2014; Tian et  al. 2018; Chadwick et  al. 2018; Dangal et  al. 2019; 
Cardenas et al. 2019). Studies consistently report that pasturelands 
and rangelands are responsible for around half of the total agricultural 
N2O emissions (Davidson 2009; Oenema et al. 2014; Dangal et al. 
2019). An analysis by Dangal et al. (2019) shows that, while managed 
pastures make up around one-quarter of the global grazing lands, 
they contribute 86% of the net global N2O emissions from grasslands 
and that more than half of these emissions are related to direct 
deposition of livestock excreta on soils. 
Many studies calculate N2O emissions from a linear relationship 
between nitrogen application rates and N2O emissions. New studies 
are increasingly finding nonlinear relationships, which means that 
N2O emissions per hectare are lower than the Tier 1 EFs (IPCC 
2003) at low nitrogen application rates, and higher at high nitrogen 
application rates (robust evidence, high agreement) (Shcherbak et al. 
2014; van Lent et al. 2015; Satria 2017). This not only has implications 
for how agricultural N2O emissions are estimated in national and 
regional inventories, which now often use a linear relationship 
between nitrogen applied and N2O emissions, it also means that in 
regions of the world where low nitrogen application rates dominate, 
increases in nitrogen fertiliser use would generate relatively small 
increases in agricultural N2O emissions. Decreases in application 
rates in regions where application rates are high and exceed crop 
demand for parts of the growing season are likely to have very large 
effects on emissions reductions (medium evidence, high agreement).
Deforestation and other forms of land-use change alter soil N2O 
emissions. Typically, N2O emissions increase following conversion of 
native forests and grasslands to pastures or croplands (McDaniel et al. 
2019; van Lent et  al. 2015). This increase lasts from a few years 
to a decade or more, but there is a trend toward decreased N2O 
emissions with time following land use change and, ultimately, lower 
N2O emissions than had been occurring under native vegetation, 
in the absence of fertilisation (medium evidence, high agreement) 
(Meurer et al. 2016; van Lent et al. 2015) (Figure 2.12). Conversion 
of native vegetation to fertilised systems typically leads to increased 
N2O emissions over time, with the rate of emission often being 
a function of nitrogen fertilisation rates, however, this response can 
be moderated by soil characteristics and water availability (medium 
evidence, high agreement) (van Lent et al. 2015; Meurer et al. 2016). 
Restoration of agroecosystems to natural vegetation, over the period 
of one to two decades does not lead to recovery of N2O emissions 
to the levels of the original vegetation (McDaniel et al. 2019). To 
conclude, findings since AR5 increasingly highlight the limits of linear 
N2O emission factors, particularly from field to regional scales, with 
emissions rising nonlinearly at high nitrogen application rates (high 
confidence). Emissions from unfertilised systems often increase and 
then decline over time with typically lower emissions than was the 
case under native vegetation (high confidence).
While soil emissions are the predominant source  of N2O in 
agriculture, other sources are important (or their importance is only 
just emerging). Biomass burning is responsible for approximately 
0.7 TgN2O-N yr–1 (0.5–1.7 TgN2O-N yr–1) or 11% of total gross 
anthropogenic emissions due to the release of N2O from the oxidation 
of organic nitrogen in biomass (UNEP 2013). This source includes crop 
residue burning, forest fires, household cook stoves and prescribed 
savannah, pasture and cropland burning. Aquaculture is currently 
not accounted for in most assessments or compilations. While it is 
currently responsible for less than 0.1 TgN2O-N yr–1, it is one of the 
fastest growing sources of anthropogenic N2O emissions (Williams 
and Crutzen 2010; Bouwman et  al. 2013) (limited evidence, high 
agreement). Finally, increased nitrogen deposition from terrestrial 
sources is leading to greater indirect N2O emissions, particularly 
since 1980 (moderate evidence, high agreement) (Tian et al. 2018, 
2016). In marine systems, deposition is estimated to have increased 
the oceanic N2O source by 0.2 TgN2O-N yr–1 or 3% of total gross 
anthropogenic emissions (Suntharalingam et al. 2012).

Box 2.2 |  Methodologies for estimating national to global scale anthropogenic land carbon fluxes 
Bookkeeping/accounting models calculate changes in biomass and soils that result from changes in land activity using data 
on biomass density and rates of growth/decomposition, typically from ground-based inventory data collection (field measurements 
of carbon in trees and soils) (Houghton et al. 2012; Hansis et al. 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017). The approach includes only 
those changes directly caused by major categories of land-use change and management. The models do not explicitly include the 
indirect effects to changing environmental conditions, although some effects are implicit in the biomass, growth rates and decay rates 
used. Thus, the models may overestimate past fluxes. The bookkeeping models include fluxes from peatland burning based on GFED 
estimates (Randerson et al. 2015).
DGVMs simulate ecological processes, such as photosynthesis, respiration, allocation, growth, decomposition etc., driven by 
environmental conditions (climate variability, climate change, CO2, nitrogen concentrations). Models vary with respect to the 
processes included, with many since AR5 now including forest management, fire, nitrogen and other management (Sitch et al. 2005; 
Le Quéré et al. 2018). Models are forced with increasing atmospheric CO2 and changing climate, and run with and without ‘land use 
change’ (land cover and forest harvest) to differentiate the anthropogenic effects from the indirect effects of climate and CO2: the ‘land 
sink’. Thus, indirect effects are explicitly included. This approach also includes a ‘lost atmospheric sink capacity’, or the carbon uptake due 
to environmental effects on forests that does not happen once the forests are removed (Pongratz et al. 2010). 
Integrated assessment models (IAMs) use storylines to construct alternative future scenarios of GHG emissions and atmospheric 
concentrations within a global socio-economic framework, including projections of AFOLU based on assumptions of, for example, crop 
yields, population growth and bioenergy use (Cross-Chapter Box 1 and Chapter 1). Some models include simplified DGVMs, which may 
include climate and CO2 effects, while others use AFOLU emissions from other sources. 
ESMs couple DGVMs, surface hydrology, and energy exchange models with atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice models, enabling 
exploration of feedbacks between climate change and the carbon cycle (e.g., warming effects increase soil and plant respiration 
and lead to higher atsmpheric CO2 concentrations, which in turn promote plant growth) (Friedlingstein et al. 2014). They sometimes 
include numerical experiments with and without land-use change to diagnose the anthropogenic AFOLU flux (Lawrence et al. 2016). 
Satellite data can be used as a proxy for plant activity (e.g., greenness) and to map land cover, vegetation fires and biomass 
density. Algorithms, models and independent data are used to calculate fluxes of CO2 from satellite data, although calculating the 
net carbon flux is difficult because of the lack of information on the respiratory flux. Some active satellite sensors (LiDAR) are able 
to measure three-dimensional structure in woody vegetation, which is closely related to biomass density (Zarin et al. 2016; Baccini 
et al. 2012; Saatchi et al. 2011). Together with land-cover change data, these estimates of biomass density can be used to provide

Box 2.2 (continued)
observational-based estimates of fluxes due to changes in forest area (e.g., Tyukavina et al. (2015), Harris et al. (2015) and Baccini et al. 
(2012) or degradation (Baccini et al. 2017)). Satellite estimates of biomass vary considerably (Mitchard et al. 2013; Saatchi et al. 2015; 
Avitabile et al. 2016): data are available only for recent decades, methods generally assume that all losses of carbon are immediately 
released to the atmosphere and changes in soil carbon are generally ignored. The approach implicitly includes indirect and natural 
disturbance effects as well as direct anthropogenic effects.
Atmospheric inversions use observations of atmospheric concentrations with a model of atmospheric transport, based on 
data for wind speed and direction, to calculate implied emissions (Gatti et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2017a; van der Laan-Luijkx et al. 2017). 
Since AR5, there has been an increase in availability of concentration data from flux tower networks and satellites, enabling better 
global coverage at finer spatial scales and some national estimates (e.g., in the UK inverse techniques are used together with 
national GHG inventories). A combination of concentrations of different gases and isotopes enables the separation of fossil, ocean and 
land fluxes. However, inversions give only the net flux of CO2 from land; they cannot separate natural and anthropogenic fluxes. 
Micrometeorological flux measurements data on CO2 concentrations and air movements recorded on instrumented towers enable 
the calculation of CO2 flux at the ecosystem scale. Global and regional Flux Networks (FluxNet (global), AsiaFlux, Ameriflux (North 
America), ICOS (EU), NEON (USA), and others) contribute to a global flux database, which is used to verify the results of modelling, 
inventory and remote sensing studies. 
FAOSTAT has produced country level estimates of GHG emissions (Tubiello et al. 2013) from agriculture (1961–2016) and land 
use (1990–2016) using a globally consistent methodological approach based largely on IPCC Tier 1 methods of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines (FAO 2015). FAO emissions estimates were used as one of the three database inputs into the AR5 WGIII AFOLU chapter. 
Non-CO2 emissions from agriculture are estimated directly from national statistics of activity data reported by countries to FAO. 
CO2 emissions from land use and land-use change are computed mostly at Tier 1, albeit at fine geospatial scales to capture effects 
from peatland degradation and biomass fires (Rossi et al. 2016). Emissions from forest land and deforestation are based on the 
IPCC carbon stock change method, thus constituting a Tier 3 estimate relying on country statistics of carbon stocks and forest area 
collected through the FAO FRA. The carbon flux is estimated assuming instantaneous emissions in the year of forest area loss and 
changes in carbon stocks within extant forests, but does not distinguish ‘managed’ and ‘unmanaged’ forest areas, albeit it treats 
separately emissions from primary, secondary and planted forest (Federici et al. 2015). 
Country Reporting of GHG Inventories (GHGIs): All parties to the UNFCCC are required to report national GHGIs of anthropogenic 
emissions and removals. Reporting requirements are differentiated between developed and developing countries. Because of the 
difficulty of separating direct anthropogenic fluxes from indirect or natural fluxes, the IPCC (2003) adopted the ‘managed land’ 
concept as a proxy to facilitate GHGI reporting. All GHG fluxes on ‘managed land’ are defined as anthropogenic, with each country 
applying their own definition of ‘managed land’ (i.e., ‘where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform 
production, ecological or social functions’ (IPCC 2006)). Fluxes may be determined on the basis of changes in carbon stocks (e.g., 
from forest inventories) or by activity data (e.g., area of land cover change management activity multiplied by emission factors or with 
modelled fluxes). Depending on the specific methods used, GHGIs include all direct anthropogenic effects and may include the indirect 
anthropogenic effects of environmental change (generally sinks) and natural effects (Section 2.3.1.2). GHG fluxes from ‘unmanaged 
land’ are not reported in GHGIs because they are assumed to be non-anthropogenic. The reported estimates may then be filtered 
through agreed ‘accounting rules’ (i.e., what countries actually count towards their mitigation targets (Cowie et al. 2007; Lee and Sanz 
2017). The accounting aims to better quantify the additional mitigation actions by, for example, factoring out the impact of natural 
disturbances and forest age-related dynamics (Canadell et al. 2007; Grassi et al. 2018).

Box 2.3 |  CO2 fertilisation and enhanced terrestrial uptake of carbon
All DGVMs and ESMs represent the CO2 fertilisation effect (Le Quéré et al. 2017; Hoffman et al. 2014). There is high confidence that 
elevated CO2 results in increased short-term CO2 uptake per unit leaf area (Swann et al. 2016; Field et al. 1995; Donohue et al. 2013), 
however, whether this increased CO2 uptake at the leaf level translates into increased growth for the whole plant differs among plant 
species and environments, because growth is constrained by whole-plant resource allocation and nutrient limitation (e.g., nitrogen, 
phosphorus, potassium and soil water and light limitations (Körner 2006; Peñuelas et al. 2017; Friend et al. 2014a)). Interactions 
between plants and soil microbes further modulate the degree of nutrient limitation on CO2 fertilisation (Terrer et al. 2017).
At the ecosystems level, enhanced CO2 uptake at decadal or longer timescales depends on changes in plant community composition 
and ecosystem respiration, as well disturbance and natural plant mortality (De Kauwe et al., 2016; Farrior et al., 2015; Keenan et al., 
2017; Sulman et al, 2019). The results of free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments over two decades are highly variable 
because of these factors (Norby et al. 2010; Körner 2015; Feng et al. 2015; Paschalis et al. 2017; Terrer et al. 2017; Du et al. 2019). Under 
higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the ratio of CO2 uptake to water loss (water use efficiency (WUE)), increases and enhances 
drought tolerance of plants (high confidence) (Berry et al., 2010; Ainsworth and Rogers 2007). 
Long-term CO2 and water vapour flux measurements show that WUE in temperate and boreal forests of the northern hemisphere 
has increased more than predicted by photosynthetic theory and models over the past two decades (high confidence) (Keenan et al. 
2013; Laguë and Swann 2016). New theories have emerged on how CO2 uptake by trees is related to water loss and to the risk of 
damaging xylem (water conducting tissues) in the trunk and branches (Wolf et al. 2016a; Anderegg et al. 2018a). Tree ring studies of 
stable carbon and oxygen isotopes also detected increased WUE in recent decades (Battipaglia et al. 2013; Silva and Anand 2013; van 
der Sleen et al. 2014). Yet, tree ring studies often fail to show acceleration of tree growth rates in support of CO2 fertilisation, even 
when they show increased WUE (van der Sleen et al. 2014). The International Tree Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) indicated that only about 
20% of the sites in the database showed increasing trends in tree growth that cannot be explained by climate variability, nitrogen 
deposition, elevation or latitude. Thus there is limited evidence (low agreement) among observations of enhanced tree growth due to 
CO2 fertilisation of forests during the 20th century (Gedalof and Berg 2010).
In grasslands, although it is possible for CO2 fertilisation to alleviate the impacts of drought and heat stress on net carbon uptake 
(Roy et al. 2016), there is low confidence about its projected magnitude. Because of its effect on water use efficiency, CO2 fertilisation 
is expected to be pronounced in semi-arid habitats; and because of different metabolic pathways, C3 plants are expected to be more 
sensitive to elevated CO2 concentrations than C4 grasses (Donohue et al. 2013; Morgan et al. 2011; Derner et al. 2003). Neither of these 
expectations was observed over a 12-year study of elevated CO2 in a grassland system: enhanced growth was not observed during dry 
summers and growth of C4 grasses was unexpectedly stimulated, while growth of C3 grasses was not (Reich et al. 2014, 2018).
There is medium confidence that CO2 fertilisation effects have increased water use efficiency in crops and thus reduced agricultural water 
use per unit of crop produced (Deryng et al. 2016; Nazemi and Wheater 2015; Elliott et al. 2014). This effect could lead to near-term 
continued greening of agricultural areas. However, current assessments of these effects are based on limited observations, mostly from 
the temperate zone (Deryng et al. 2016).
One line of evidence for CO2 fertilisation is the increasing land sink (‘the residual land sink’ in AR5) over the last 50 years as the 
atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased (Los 2013; Sitch et al. 2015; Campbell et al. 2017; Keenan and Riley 2018). A combined 
analysis of atmospheric inverse analyses, ecosystem models and forest inventory data concluded that 60% of the recent terrestrial 
carbon sink can be directly attributed to increasing atmospheric CO2 (Schimel et al. 2015). A global analysis using a ‘reconstructed 
vegetation index’ (RVI) for the period 1901–2006 from MODIS satellite-derived normalised vegetation difference index (NDVI) showed 
that CO2 fertilisation contributed at least 40% of the observed increase in the land carbon sink (Los 2013). Without CO2 fertilisation, 
ESMs are unable to simulate the increasing land sink and the observed atmospheric CO2 concentration growth rate since the middle 
of the 20th century (Shevliakova et al. 2013). There are other mechanisms that could explain enhanced land carbon uptake such as 
increased regional forest and shrub cover (Chen et al. 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 and Chapter 1), and, at higher latitudes, increasing 
temperatures and longer growing seasons (Zhu et al. 2016).
In summary, there is low confidence about the magnitude of the CO2 effect and other factors that may explain at least a portion of 
the land sink (e.g., nitrogen deposition, increased growing season, reduced burning, erosion and re-deposition or organic sediments, 
aerosol-induced cooling). Increases in atmospheric CO2 result in increased water use efficiency and increase leaf-level photosynthesis 
(high confidence). The extent to which CO2 fertilisation results in plant- or ecosystem-level carbon accumulation is highly variable 
and affected by other environmental constraints (high confidence). Even in ecosystems where CO2 fertilisation has been detected in 
recent decades, those effects are found to weaken as a result of physiological acclimation, soil nutrient limitation and other constraints 
on growth (Friend et al., 2014; Körner, 2006; Peñuelas et al., 2017).

2.4 
Emissions and impacts of short-lived 
climate forcers (SLCF) from land
While the rising atmospheric concentration of GHGs is the largest 
driver of anthropogenic changes in climate, the levels of short-lived 
climate forcers (SLCF) can significantly modulate regional climate 
by altering radiation exchanges and hydrological cycle and impact 
ecosystems (high confidence) (Boucher et al. 2013; Rogelj et al. 2014; 
Kok et al. 2018). This section assesses the current state of knowledge 
with respect to past and future emissions of the three major SLCFs 
and their precursors: mineral dust, carbonaceous aerosols (black 
carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC)) and BVOCs. This section also 
reports on implications of changes in their emissions for climate. 
Aerosols particles with diameters between about 0.010 μm to about 
20 μm are recognised as SLCFs, a term that refers to their short 
atmospheric lifetime (a few days). BVOCs are important precursors 
of ozone and OC, both important climate forcing agents with short 
atmospheric lifetimes.
While the AR5 did not assess land aerosols emissions in depth, 
their findings stated that although progress in quantifying regional 
emissions of anthropogenic and natural land aerosols has been 
made, considerable uncertainty still remains about their historical 
trends, their inter-annual and decadal variability and about any 
changes in the future (Calvo et al. 2013; Klimont et al. 2017). Some 
new and improved understanding of processes controlling emissions 
and atmospheric processing has been developed since AR5, for 
example, a better understanding of the climatic role of BC as well 
as the understanding of the role of BVOCs in formation of secondary 
organic aerosols (SOA).
Depending on the chemical composition and size, aerosols can 
absorb or scatter sunlight and thus directly affect the amount of 
absorbed and scattered radiation (Fuzzi et al. 2015; Nousiainen 2011; 
de Sá et al. 2019) Aerosols affect cloud formation and development, 
and thus can also influence precipitation patterns and amounts 
(Suni et al. 2015). In addition, deposition of aerosols – especially BC – 
on snow and ice surfaces can reduce albedo and increase warming 
as a self-reinforcing feedback. Aerosols deposition also changes 
biogeochemical cycling in critical terrestrial ecosystems, with 
deposition of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus (Andreae 
et  al. 2002). Primary land aerosols are emitted directly into the 
atmosphere due to natural or anthropogenic processes and include 
mineral aerosols (or dust), volcanic dust, soot from combustion, 
organic aerosols from industry, vehicles or biomass burning, 
bioaerosols from forested regions and others. SOAs are particulates 
that are formed in the atmosphere by the gas-to-particles conversion 
processes from gaseous precursors, such as BVOCs, and account for 
a large fraction of fine mode (particles less than 2.5μm) aerosol mass 
(Hodzic et al. 2016; Manish et al. 2017). Land use change can affect 
the climate through changed emissions of SLCFs such as aerosols, 
ozone precursors and methane.
Aerosols from air pollution will decline in the coming years as a means 
for improving urban and regional air, but their removal will lead to 
additional warming (Boucher et al. 2013), with important regional 
variability, and partially offsetting projected mitigation effects for 
two to three decades in 1.5°C consistent pathways (high confidence) 
(IPCC 2018). It is important to emphasise that changes in emissions 
can either be due to external forcing or through a feedback in the 
climate system (Box 2.1). For instance, enhanced dust emissions 
due to reduced vegetation could be a forcing if overgrazing is the 
cause of larger dust emission, or a feedback if dryer climate is the 
cause. This distinction is important in terms of mitigation measures 
to be implemented.
2.4.1 
Mineral dust
One of the most abundant atmospheric aerosols emitted into the 
atmosphere is mineral dust, a ‘natural’ aerosol that is produced by 
wind strong enough to initiate the emissions process of sandblasting. 
Mineral dust is preferentially emitted from dry and unvegetated soils 
in topographic depressions where deep layers of alluvium have 
been accumulated (Prospero et al. 2002). Dust is also emitted from 
disturbed soils by human activities, with a 25% contribution to global 
emissions based on a satellite-based estimate (Ginoux et al. 2012).
Dust is then transported over long distances across continents and 
oceans. The dust cycle, which consists of mineral dust emission, 
transport, deposition and stabilisation, has multiple interactions with 
many climate processes and biogeochemical cycles.
2.4.1.1 
Mineral dust as a short-lived climate forcer from land
Depending on the dust mineralogy, mixing state and size, dust 
particles can absorb or scatter shortwave and longwave radiation. 
Dust particles serve as cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei. They 
can influence the microphysical properties of clouds, their lifetime and 
precipitation rate (Kok et al. 2018). New and improved understanding 
of processes controlling emissions and transport of dust, its regional 
patterns and variability, as well as its chemical composition, has been 
developed since AR5.
While satellites remain the primary source of information to locate 
dust sources and atmospheric burden, in-situ data remains critical to 
constrain optical and mineralogical properties of the dust (Di Biagio 
et  al. 2017; Rocha-Lima et  al. 2018). Dust particles are composed 
of minerals, including iron oxides which strongly absorb shortwave 
radiation and provide nutrients for marine ecosystems. Another 
mineral such as feldspar is an efficient ice nuclei (Harrison et  al. 
2016). Dust mineralogy varies depending on the native soils, so 
global databases were developed to characterise the mineralogical 
composition of soils for use in weather and climate models (Journet 
et al. 2014; Perlwitz et al. 2015). New field campaigns, as well as 
new analyses of observations from prior campaigns, have produced 
insights into the role of dust in western Africa in climate system, such 
as long-ranged transport of dust across the Atlantic (Groß et al. 2015) 
and the characterisation of aerosol particles and their ability to act as 
ice and cloud condensation nuclei (Price et al. 2018). Size distribution 
at emission is another key parameter controlling dust interactions with 
radiation. Most models now use the parametrisation of Kok (2011) 
based on the theory of brittle material. It was shown that most models 
underestimate the size of the global dust cycle (Kok 2011).

Land–climate interactions

Characterisation of spatial and temporal distribution of dust emissions 
is essential for weather prediction and climate projections (high 
confidence). Although there is a growing confidence in characterising 
the seasonality and peak of dust emissions (i.e.,  spring–summer 
(Wang et al. 2015)) and how the meteorological and soil conditions 
control dust sources, an understanding of long-term future dust 
dynamics, inter-annual dust variability and how they will affect future 
climate still requires substantial work. Dust is also important at high 
latitude, where it has an impact on snow-covered surface albedo and 
weather (Bullard et al. 2016).
2.4.1.2 
Effects of past climate change on dust 
emissions and feedbacks
A limited number of model-based studies found that dust emissions 
have increased significantly since the late 19th century: by 25% from 
the preindustrial period to the present day (e.g., from 729 Tg yr–1 to 
912 Tg yr–1) with about 50% of the increase driven by climate change 
and about 40% driven by land use cover change, such as conversion 
of natural land to agriculture (low confidence) (Stanelle et al. 2014). 
These changes resulted in a clear sky radiative forcing at the top of the 
atmosphere of –0.14 Wm–2 (Stanelle et al. 2014). The authors found 
that, in North Africa, most dust is of natural origin, with a recent 15% 
increase in dust emissions attributed to climate change. In North 
America two-thirds of dust emissions take place on agricultural 
lands and both climate change and land-use change jointly drive the 
increase; between the pre-industrial period and the present day, the 
overall effect of changes in dust was –0.14 W m–2 cooling of clear sky 
net radiative forcing on top of the atmosphere, with –0.05 W m–2 from 
land use and –0.083 W m–2 from changes in climate.
The comparison of observations for vertically integrated mass of 
atmospheric dust per unit area (i.e., dust mass path (DMP)) obtained 
from the remotely sensed data and the DMP from CMIP5 models 
reveal that the model-simulate range of DMP was much lower than 
the estimates (Evan et al. 2014). ESMs typically do not reproduce inter-
annual and longer timescales variability seen in observations (Evan 
et al. 2016). Analyses of the CMIP5 models (Evan 2018; Evan et al. 
2014) reveal that all climate models systematically underestimate 
dust emissions, the amount of dust in the atmosphere and its inter-
annual variability (medium confidence). 
One commonly suggested reason for the lack of dust variability in 
climate models is the models’ inability to simulate the effects of land 
surface changes on dust emission (Stanelle et al. 2014). Models that 
account for changes in land surface show more agreement with the 
satellite observations both in terms of aerosol optical depth and DMP 
(Kok et al. 2014). New prognostic dust emissions models are now 
able to account for both changes in surface winds and vegetation 
characteristics (e.g., leaf area index and stem area index) and soil 
water, ice and snow cover (Evans et  al. 2016). As a result, new 
modelling studies (e.g., Evans et al. 2016) indicate that, in regions 
where soil and vegetation respond strongly to ENSO events, such 
as in Australia, inclusion of dynamic vegetation characteristics into 
dust emission parameterisations improves comparisons between the 
modelled and observed relationship with long-term climate variability 
(e.g., ENSO) and dust levels (Evans et al. 2016). Thus, there has been 
progress in incorporating the effects of vegetation, soil moisture, 
surface wind and vegetation on dust emission source functions, but 
the number of studies demonstrating such improvement remains 
small (limited evidence, medium agreement).
2.4.1.3 
Future changes of dust emissions
There is no agreement about the direction of future changes in dust 
emissions. Atmospheric dust loading is projected to increase over the 
southern edge of the Sahara in association with surface wind and 
precipitation changes (Pu and Ginoux, 2018), while Evan et al. (2016) 
project a decline in African dust emissions. Dust optical depth (DOD) 
is also projected to increase over the central Arabian peninsula in all 
seasons, and to decrease over northern China from March-April-May 
to September-October-November (Pu and Ginoux 2018). Climate 
models project rising drought risks over the south-western and central 
US in the 21st century. The projected drier regions largely overlay 
the major dust sources in the US. However, whether dust activity 
in the US will increase in the future is not clear, due to the large 
uncertainty in dust modelling (Pu and Ginoux 2017). Future trends of 
dust emissions will depend on changes in precipitation patterns and 
atmospheric circulation (limited evidence, high agreement). However, 
implication of changes in human activities, including mitigation 
(e.g., bioenergy production) and adaption (e.g., irrigation) are not 
characterised in the current literature.
2.4.2 
Carbonaceous aerosols
Carbonaceous aerosols are one of the most abundant components 
of aerosol particles in continental areas of the atmosphere and a key 
land–atmosphere component (Contini et al. 2018). They can make up 
to 60–80% of PM2.5 (particulate matter with size less than 2.5 µm) 
in urban and remote atmospheres (Tsigaridis et al. 2014; Kulmala 
et al. 2011). It comprises an organic fraction (OC) and a refractory 
light-absorbing component, generally referred to as elemental carbon 
(EC), from which BC is the optically active absorption component of 
EC (Gilardoni et al. 2011; Bond et al. 2013). 
2.4.2.1 
Carbonaceous aerosol precursors of short-lived 
climate forcers from land
OC is a major component of aerosol mass concentration, and it 
originates from different anthropogenic (combustion processes) and 
natural (natural biogenic emissions) sources (Robinson et al. 2007). 
A large fraction of OC in the atmosphere has a secondary origin, 
as it can be formed in the atmosphere through condensation to the 
aerosol phase of low vapour pressure gaseous compounds emitted 
as primary pollutants or formed in the atmosphere. This component 
is SOA (Hodzic et al. 2016). A third component of the optically active 
aerosols is the so-called brown carbon (BrC), an organic material that 
shows enhanced solar radiation absorption at short wavelengths 
(Wang et al. 2016b; Laskin et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2016a; Bond et al. 
2013; Saturno et al. 2018).
OC and EC have distinctly different optical properties, with OC being 
important for the scattering properties of aerosols and EC central for 
168
Chapter 2

the absorption component (Rizzo et al. 2013; Tsigaridis et al. 2014; 
Fuzzi et al. 2015). While OC is reflective and scatters solar radiation, it 
has a cooling effect on climate. On the other side, BC and BrC absorb 
solar radiation and they have a warming effect in the climate system 
(Bond et al. 2013).
OC is also characterised by a high solubility with a high fraction of 
water-soluble organic compounds (WSOC) and it is one of the main 
drivers of the oxidative potential of atmospheric particles. This makes 
particles loaded with oxidised OC an efficient cloud condensation 
nuclei (CCN) in most of the conditions (Pöhlker et al. 2016; Thalman 
et al. 2017; Schmale et al. 2018). 
Biomass burning is a major global source of carbonaceous aerosols 
(Bowman et al. 2011; Harrison et al. 2010; Reddington et al. 2016; 
Artaxo et al. 2013). As knowledge of past fire dynamics improved 
through new satellite observations, new fire proxies’ datasets 
(Marlon et al. 2013; van Marle et al. 2017a), process-based models 
(Hantson et al. 2016) and a new historic biomass burning emissions 
dataset starting in 1750 have been developed (van Marle et  al. 
2017b) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). Revised versions 
of OC biomass burning emissions (van Marle et al. 2017b) show, 
in general, reduced trends compared to the emissions derived 
by Lamarque et  al. (2010) for CMIP5. CMIP6 global emissions 
pathways (Gidden et al. 2018; Hoesly et al. 2018) estimate global 
BC emissions in 2015 at 9.8 MtBC yr–1, while global OC emissions 
are 35 MtOC yr–1. 
Land use change is critically important for carbonaceous aerosols, 
since biomass-burning emissions consist mostly of organic aerosol, 
and the undisturbed forest is also a large source of organic aerosols 
(Artaxo et  al. 2013). Additionally, urban aerosols are also mostly 
carbonaceous because of the source composition (traffic, combustion, 
industry, etc.) (Fuzzi et al. 2015). Burning of fossil fuels, biomass-
burning emissions and SOA from natural BVOC emissions are the 
main global sources of carbonaceous aerosols. Any change in each 
of these components directly influence the radiative forcing (Contini 
et al. 2018; Boucher et al. 2013; Bond et al. 2013).
One important component of carbonaceous aerosols is the primary 
biological aerosol particles (PBAP), also called bioaerosols, that 
correspond to a significant fraction of aerosols in forested areas 
(Fröhlich-Nowoisky et  al. 2016; Pöschl and Shiraiwa 2015). They 
are emitted directly by the vegetation as part of the biological 
processes (Huffman et  al. 2012). Airborne bacteria, fungal spores, 
pollen, archaea, algae and other bioparticles are essential for the 
reproduction and spread of organisms across various terrestrial 
ecosystems. They can serve as nuclei for cloud droplets, ice crystals 
and precipitation, thus influencing the hydrological cycle and climate 
(Whitehead et al. 2016; Scott et al. 2015; Pöschl et al. 2010).
2.4.2.2 
Effects of past climate change on carbonaceous 
aerosols emissions and feedbacks
Annual global emission estimates of BC range from 7.2–7.5 Tg yr–1 
(using bottom-up inventories) (Bond et al. 2013; Klimont et al. 2017) 
up to 17.8 ± 5.6 Tg yr–1  (using a fully coupled climate-aerosol-
urban model constrained by aerosol measurements)  (Cohen  and 
Wang 2014), with considerably higher BC emissions for Eastern 
Europe, southern East Asia, and Southeast Asia, mostly due to higher 
anthropogenic BC emissions estimates. A significant source of BC, 
the net trend in global burned area from 2000–2012 was a modest 
decrease of 4.3 Mha yr–1 (–1.2% yr–1). 
Carbonaceous aerosols are important in urban areas as well as 
pristine continental regions, since they can be responsible for 
50–85% of PM2.5 (Contini et al. 2018; Klimont et al. 2017). In boreal 
and tropical forests, carbonaceous aerosols originate from BVOC 
oxidation (Section 2.4.3). The largest global source of BC aerosols 
is open burning of forests, savannah and agricultural lands with 
emissions of about 2700 Gg yr–1 in the year 2000 (Bond et al. 2013).
ESMs most likely underestimate globally averaged EC emissions 
(Bond et al. 2013; Cohen and Wang 2014), although recent emission 
inventories have included an upwards adjustment in these numbers 
(Hoesly et al. 2018). Vertical EC profiles have also been shown to 
be poorly constrained (Samset et al. 2014), with a general tendency 
of too much EC at high altitudes. Models differ strongly in the 
magnitude and importance of the coating-enhancement of ambient 
EC absorption (Boucher et  al. 2016; Gustafsson and Ramanathan 
2016) in their estimated lifetime of these particles, as well as in dry 
and wet removal efficiency (limited evidence, medium agreement) 
(Mahmood et al. 2016). 
The equilibrium in emissions and concentrations between the 
scattering properties of organic aerosol versus the absorption 
component of BC is a key ingredient in the future climatic projections of 
aerosol effects (limited evidence, high agreement). The uncertainties 
in net climate forcing from BC-rich sources are substantial, largely 
due to lack of knowledge about cloud interactions with both BC 
and co-emitted OC. A strong positive forcing of about 1.1 wm–2 
was calculated by Bond et al. (2013), but this forcing is balanced by 
a negative forcing of –1.45 wm–2, and shows clearly a need to work 
on the co-emission issue for carbonaceous aerosols. The forcing will 
also depend on the aerosol-cloud interactions, where carbonaceous 
aerosol can be coated and change their CCN capability. It is difficult to 
estimate the changes in any of these components in a future climate, 
but this will strongly influence the radiative forcing (high confidence) 
(Contini et al. 2018; Boucher et al. 2013; Bond et al. 2013).
De Coninck et al. (2018) reported studies estimating a lower global 
temperature effect from BC mitigation (e.g., Samset et  al. 2014; 
Boucher et  al. 2016), although commonly used models do not 
capture properly observed effects of BC and co-emissions on climate 
(e.g., Bond et  al. 2013). Regionally, the warming effects can be 
substantially larger, for example, in the Arctic (Sand et al. 2015) and 
high mountain regions near industrialised areas or areas with heavy 
biomass-burning impacts (high confidence) (Ming et al. 2013).
2.4.2.3 
Future changes of carbonaceous aerosol emissions
Due to the short atmospheric lifetime of carbonaceous aerosols in 
the atmosphere, of the order of a few days, most studies dealing with 
the future concentration levels have a regional character (Cholakian 
169
Land–climate interactions  
Chapter 2
2
et al. 2018; Fiore et al. 2012). The studies agree that the uncertainties 
in changes in emissions of aerosols and their precursors are generally 
higher than those connected to climate change itself. Confidence in 
future changes in carbonaceous aerosol concentration projections 
is limited by the reliability of natural and anthropogenic emissions 
(including wildfires, largely caused by human activity) of primary 
aerosol as well as that of the precursors. The Aerosol Chemistry 
Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) is endorsed by the 
Coupled-Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) and is designed 
to quantify the climate impacts of aerosols and chemically reactive 
gases (Lamarque et  al. 2013). These simulations calculated future 
responses to SLCF emissions for the RCP scenarios in terms of 
concentration changes and radiative forcing. Carbonaceous aerosol 
emissions are expected to increase in the near future due to possible 
increases in open biomass-burning emissions (from forest, savannah 
and agricultural fires), and increase in SOA from oxidation of BVOCs 
(medium confidence) (Tsigaridis et al. 2014; van Marle et al. 2017b; 
Giglio et al. 2013).
More robust knowledge has been produced since the conclusions 
reported in AR5 (Boucher et al. 2013) and all lines of evidence now 
agree on a small effect on carbonaceous aerosol global burden 
due to climate change (medium confidence). The regional effects, 
however, are predicted to be much higher (Westervelt et al. 2015). 
With respect to possible changes in the chemical composition of 
PM as a result of future climate change, only a few sparse data are 
available in the literature and the results are, as yet, inconclusive. 
The co-benefits of reducing aerosol emissions due to air quality 
issues will play an important role in future carbonaceous aerosol 
emissions (high confidence) (Gonçalves et  al. 2018; Shindell 
et al. 2017).
2.4.3 
Biogenic volatile organic compounds
BVOCs are emitted in large amounts by forests (Guenther et  al. 
2012). They include isoprene, terpenes, alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, 
esters, carbonyls and acids (Peñuelas and Staudt 2010; Guenther 
et  al. 1995, 2012). Their emissions represent a carbon loss to 
the ecosystem, which can be up to 10% of the carbon fixed by 
photosynthesis under stressful conditions (Bracho-Nunez et  al. 
2011). The global average emission for vegetated surfaces is 
0.7g C m–2 yr–1 but can exceed 100 g C m–2 yr–1 in some tropical 
ecosystems (Peñuelas and Llusià 2003).
2.4.3.1 
BVOC precursors of short-lived climate 
forcers from land
BVOCs are rapidly oxidised in the atmosphere to form less volatile 
compounds that can condense and form SOA. In boreal and tropical 
forests, carbonaceous aerosols originate from BVOC oxidation, of 
which isoprene and terpenes are the most important precursors 
(Claeys et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2015; De Sá et al. 2017; de Sá et al. 2018; 
Liu et al. 2016b). See the following sub-section for more detail. 
BVOCs are the most important precursors of SOA. The transformation 
process of BVOCs affects the aerosol size distribution both by 
contributing to new particle formation and to the growth of larger 
pre-existing particles. SOA affects the scattering of radiation by the 
particles themselves (direct aerosol effect), but also changes the 
amount of CCN and the lifetime and optical properties of clouds 
(indirect aerosol effect). 
High amounts of SOA are observed over forest areas, in particular in 
boreal and tropical regions where they have been found to mostly 
originate from BVOC emissions (Manish et al. 2017). In particular, 
isoprene epoxydiol-derived SOA (IEPOX-SOA) is being identified in 
recent studies in North America and Amazonian forest as a major 
component in the oxidation of isoprene (Allan et al. 2014; Schulz 
et al. 2018; De Sá et al. 2017). In tropical regions, BVOCs can be 
convected up to the upper atmosphere, where their volatility is 
reduced and where they become SOA. In some cases those particles 
are transported back to the lower atmosphere (Schulz et al. 2018; 
Wang et al. 2016a; Andreae et al. 2018). In the upper troposphere 
in the Amazon, SOA are important CCN and are responsible for the 
vigorous hydrological cycle (Pöhlker et  al. 2018). This strong link 
between BVOC emissions by plants and the hydrological cycle has 
been discussed in a number of studies (Fuentes et al. 2000; Schmale 
et al. 2018; Pöhlker et al. 2018, 2016). 
Changing BVOC emissions also affect the oxidant concentrations in 
the atmosphere. Their impact on the concentration of ozone depends 
on the NOx concentrations. In polluted regions, high BVOC emissions 
lead to increased production of ozone, followed by the formation of 
more OH and a reduction in the methane lifetime. In more pristine 
regions (NOx-limited), increasing BVOC emissions instead lead 
to decreasing OH and ozone concentrations, resulting in a longer 
methane lifetime. The net effect of BVOCs then can change over time 
if NOx emissions are changing. 
BVOCs’ possible climate effects have received little attention 
because it was thought that their short lifetime would preclude 
them from having any significant direct influence on climate (Unger 
2014a; Sporre et al. 2019). Higher temperatures and increased CO2 
concentrations are (separately) expected to increase the emissions of 
BVOCs (Jardine et al. 2011, 2015; Fuentes et al. 2016). This has been 
proposed to initiate negative climate feedback mechanisms through 
increased formation of SOA (Arneth et al. 2010; Kulmala 2004; Unger 
et al. 2017). More SOA can make clouds more reflective, which can 
provide a cooling effect. Furthermore, the increase in SOA formation 
has also been proposed to lead to increased aerosol scattering, 
resulting in an increase in diffuse radiation. This could boost GPP 
and further increase BVOC emissions (Kulmala et  al. 2014; Cirino 
et al. 2014; Sena et al. 2016; Schafer et al. 2002; Ometto et al. 2005; 
Oliveira et al. 2007). This important feedback is starting to emerge 
(Sporre et al. 2019; Kulmala 2004; Arneth et al. 2017). However, there 
is evidence that this influence might be significant at different spatial 
scales, from local to global, through aerosol formation and through 
direct and indirect greenhouse effects (limited evidence, medium 
agreement). Most tropical forest BVOCs are primarily emitted from 
tree foliage, but soil microbes can also be a major source of some 
compounds including sesquiterpenes (Bourtsoukidis et al. 2018).

2.4.3.2 
Historical changes of BVOCs and contribution 
to climate change 
Climate warming over the past 30 years, together with the longer 
growing season experienced in boreal and temperate environments, 
have increased BVOC global emissions since the preindustrial times 
(limited evidence, medium agreement) (Peñuelas 2009; Sanderson 
et al. 2003; Pacifico et al. 2012). This was opposed by lower BVOC 
emissions caused by the historical conversion of natural vegetation 
and forests to cropland (limited evidence, medium agreement) 
(Unger  2013, 2014a; Fu and Liao 2014). The consequences of 
historical anthropogenic land cover change were a decrease in the 
global formation of SOA (–13%) (Scott et al. 2017) and tropospheric 
burden (–13%) (Heald and Geddes 2016). This has resulted in 
a positive radiative forcing (and thus warming) from 1850–2000 of 
0.017 W m–2 (Heald and Geddes 2016), 0.025 W m–2 (Scott et al. 
2017) and 0.09 W m–2 (Unger 2014b) through the direct aerosol 
effect. In present-day conditions, global SOA production from all 
sources spans between 13 and 121 Tg yr–1 (Tsigaridis et al. 2014). 
The indirect aerosol effect (change in cloud condensation nuclei), 
resulting from land use induced changes in BVOC emissions, adds an 
additional positive radiative forcing of 0.008 W m–2 (Scott et al. 2017). 
More studies with different model setups are needed to fully assess 
this indirect aerosol effect associated with land use change from the 
preindustrial to present. CMIP6 global emissions pathways (Hoesly 
et al. 2018; Gidden et al. 2018) estimates global VOCs emissions in 
2015 at 230 MtVOC yr–1. They also estimated that, from 2000–2015, 
emissions were up from 200–230 MtVOC yr–1.
There is (limited evidence, medium agreement) that historical 
changes in BVOC emissions have also impacted on tropospheric 
ozone. At most surface locations where land use has changed, 
the NOx concentrations are sufficiently high for the decrease 
in BVOC emissions to lead to decreasing ozone concentrations 
(Scott et al. 2017). However, in more pristine regions (with low NOx 
concentrations), the imposed conversion to agriculture has increased 
ozone through decreased BVOC emissions and their subsequent 
decrease in OH (Scott et  al. 2017; Heald and Geddes 2016). In 
parallel, the enhanced soil NOx emissions from agricultural land can 
increase the ozone concentrations in NOx limited regions (Heald and 
Geddes 2016). 
Another impact of the historical decrease in BVOC emissions is the 
reduction in the atmospheric lifetime of methane (limited evidence, 
medium agreement), which results in a negative radiative forcing 
that ranges from –0.007 W m–2 (Scott et al. 2017) to –0.07 W m–2 
(Unger 2014b). However, knowledge of the degree that BVOC 
emissions impact on oxidant concentrations, in particular OH (and 
thus methane concentrations), is still limited and therefore these 
numbers are very uncertain (Heald and Spracklen 2015; Scott 
et al. 2017). The effect of land use change on BVOC emissions are 
highly heterogeneous (Rosenkranz et  al. 2015) and though the 
global values of forcing described above are small, the local or 
regional values can be higher, and even of opposite sign, than the 
global values. 
2.4.3.3 
Future changes of BVOCs 
Studies suggest that increasing temperature will change BVOC 
emissions through change in species composition and rate of BVOC 
production. A further 2°C–3°C rise in the mean global temperature 
could increase BVOC global emissions by an additional 30–45% 
(Peñuelas and Llusià 2003). In two modelling studies, the impact 
on climate from rising BVOC emissions was found to become even 
larger with decreasing anthropogenic aerosol emissions (Kulmala 
et al. 2013; Sporre et al. 2019). A negative feedback on temperature, 
arising from the BVOC-induced increase in the first indirect aerosol 
effect, has been estimated by two studies to be in the order of 
–0.01 W m–2 K (Scott et al. 2018b; Paasonen et al. 2013). Enhanced 
aerosol scattering from increasing BVOC emissions has been 
estimated to contribute to a global gain in BVOC emissions of 7% 
(Rap et al. 2018). In a warming planet, BVOC emissions are expected 
to increase but magnitude of this increase is unknown and will 
depend on future land use change, in addition to climate (limited 
evidence, medium agreement).
There is a very limited number of studies investigating the climate 
impacts of BVOCs using future land use scenarios (Ashworth et al. 
2012; Pacifico et al. 2012). Scott et al. (2018a) found that a future 
deforestation according to the land use scenario in RCP8.5 leads to 
a 4% decrease in BVOC emissions at the end of the century. This 
resulted in a direct aerosol forcing of +0.006 W m–2 (decreased 
reflection by particles in the atmosphere) and a first indirect aerosol 
forcing of –0.001 W m–2 (change in the amount of CCN). Studies 
not including future land use scenarios but investigating the climate 
feedbacks leading to increasing future BVOC emissions, have found 
a direct aerosol effect of –0.06 W m–2 (Sporre et  al. 2019) and 
an indirect aerosol effect of –0.45 W m–2 (Makkonen et al. 2012; 
Sporre et al. 2019). The stronger aerosol effects from the feedback 
compared to the land use are, at least partly, explained by a much 
larger change in the BVOC emissions. 
A positive climate feedback could happen in a future scenario with 
increasing BVOC emissions, where higher ozone and methane 
concentrations could lead to an enhanced warming which could 
further increase BVOC emissions (Arneth et al. 2010). This possible 
feedback is mediated by NOx levels. One recent study including 
dynamic vegetation, land use change, CO2 and climate change found 
no increase and even a slight decrease in global BVOC emissions 
at the end of the century (Hantson et al. 2017). There is a lack of 
understanding concerning the processes governing the BVOC 
emissions, the oxidation processes in the atmosphere, the role of 
the BVOC oxidation products in new particle formation and particle 
growth, as well as general uncertainties in aerosol–cloud interactions. 
There is a need for continued research into these processes, but the 
current knowledge indicates that changing BVOC emissions need to 
be taken into consideration when assessing the future climate and 
how land use will affect it. In summary, the magnitude and sign of 
net effect of BVOC emissions on the radiation budget and surface 
temperature is highly uncertain.

Land impacts on climate and weather 
through biophysical and GHG effects
The focus of this section is summarised in Figure 2.13. We report 
on what we know regarding the influence land has on climate via 
biophysical and biogeochemical exchanges. Biogeochemical effects 
herein only refer to changes in net emissions of CO2 from land. 
The influence of land on atmospheric composition is discussed in 
Section 2.3.
All sections discuss impacts of land on global and regional 
climate, and climate extremes, whenever the information is 
available. Section  2.5.1 presents effects of historical and future 
land use scenarios, Section 2.5.2 is devoted to impacts of specific 
anthropogenic land uses such as forestation, deforestation, 
irrigation, crop and forest management, Section 2.5.3 focuses 
on how climate-driven land changes feedback on climate, and 
Section 2.5.4 puts forward the theory that land use changes in one 
region can affect another region. 
2.5.1 
Impacts of historical and future anthropogenic 
land cover changes
The studies reported below focus essentially on modelling 
experiments, as there is no direct observation of how historical land 
use changes have affected the atmospheric dynamics and physics 
at the global and regional scales. Moreover, the climate modelling 
experiments only assess the impacts of anthropogenic land cover 
changes (e.g., deforestation, urbanisation) and neglect the effects of 
changes in land management (e.g., irrigation, use of fertilisers, choice 
of species varieties among managed forests or crops). Because of this 
restricted accounting for land use changes, we will use the term ‘land 
cover changes’ in Sections 2.5.1.1 and 2.5.1.2.
Each section starts by describing changes at the global scale and 
regional scale, and ends with what we know about the impacts 
of those scenarios on extreme weather events, whenever the 
information is available.
2.5.1.1 
Impacts of global historical land cover changes 
on climate
At the global level
The contribution of anthropogenic land cover changes to the net 
global warming throughout the 20th century has been derived 
from few model-based estimates that account simultaneously 
for biogeochemical and biophysical effects of land on climate 
(Table 2.4). The simulated net change in mean global annual surface 
air temperature, averaged over all the simulations, is a small warming 
of 0.078 ± 0.093°C, ranging from small cooling simulated by two 
models (–0.05°C and –0.02°C respectively in Brovkin et al. (2004) 
and Simmons and Matthews (2016), to larger warming simulated 
by three models (>+0.14°C; Shevliakova et al. 2013; Pongratz et al. 
2010; Matthews et  al. 2004). When starting from the Holocene 
period, He et al. (2014) estimated an even larger net warming effect 
of anthropogenic land cover changes (+0.72°C).

This net small warming signal results from the competing effects 
of biophysical cooling (medium confidence) and biogeochemical 
warming (very high confidence) (Figure 2.141). The global biophysical 
cooling alone has been estimated by a larger range of climate models 
and is –0.10 ± 0.14°C; it ranges from –0.57°C to +0.06°C (e.g., Zhang 
et al. 2013a; Hua and Chen 2013; Jones et al. 2013b; Simmons and 
Matthews 2016) (Table A2.1). This cooling is essentially dominated 
by increases in surface albedo: historical land cover changes have 
generally led to a dominant brightening of land as discussed in AR5 
(Myhre et al. 2013). Reduced incoming longwave radiation at the 
surface from reduced evapotranspiration and thus less water vapour 
in the atmosphere has also been reported as a potential contributor to 
this cooling (Claussen et al. 2001). The cooling is, however, dampened 
by decreases in turbulent fluxes, leading to decreased loss of heat 
and water vapour from the land through convective processes. Those 
non-radiative processes are well-known to often oppose the albedo-
induced surface temperature changes (e.g., Davin and de Noblet-
Ducoudre (2010), Boisier et al. (2012)). 
Historical land cover changes have contributed to the increase in 
atmospheric CO2 content (Section 2.3) and thus to global warming 
(biogeochemical effect, very high confidence). The global mean 
biogeochemical warming has been calculated from observation-
based estimates (+0.25 ± 0.10°C) (e.g., Li et al. (2017a), Avitabile 
et  al. (2016), Carvalhais et  al. (2014), Le Quéré et  al. (2015)), or 
estimated from DGVMs (+0.24 ± 0.12°C) (Peng et al. 2017; Arneth 
et al. 2017; Pugh et al. 2015; Hansis et al. 2015) and global climate 
models (+0.20 ± 0.05°C) (Pongratz et al. 2010; Brovkin et al. 2004; 
Matthews et al. 2004; Simmons and Matthews 2016).
The magnitude of these simulated biogeochemical effects may, 
however, be underestimated as they do not account for a number of 
processes such as land management, nitrogen/phosphorus cycles, 
changes in the emissions of CH4, N2O and non-GHG emissions 
from land (Ward et al. 2014; Arneth et al. 2017; Cleveland et al. 
2015; Pongratz et al. 2018). Two studies have accounted for those 
compounds and found a global net positive radiative forcing in 
response to historical anthropogenic land cover changes, indicating 
a net surface warming (Mahowald et al. 2017; Ward et al. 2014). 
However, first the estimated biophysical radiative forcing in those 
studies only accounts for changes in albedo and not for changes in 
turbulent fluxes. Secondly, the combined estimates also depend on 
other several key modelling estimates such as climate sensitivity, 
CO2 fertilisation caused by land use emissions, possible synergistic 
effects, validity of radiative forcing concept for land forcing. The 
comparison with the other above-mentioned modelling studies is 
thus difficult.
In addition, most of those estimates do not account for the evolution 
of natural vegetation in unmanaged areas, while observations 
and numerical studies have reported a greening of the land in 
boreal regions resulting from both extended growing season and 
poleward migration of tree lines (Lloyd et al. 2003; Lucht et al. 1995; 
Section 2.2). This greening enhances global warming via a reduction 
of surface albedo (winter darkening of the land through the snow-
albedo feedbacks; e.g., Forzieri et al. 2017). At the same time, cooling 
occurs due to increased evapotranspiration during the growing 
season, along with enhanced photosynthesis, in essence, increased 
CO2 sink (Qian et  al. 2010). When feedbacks from the poleward 
migration of treeline are accounted for, together with the biophysical 
effects of historical anthropogenic land cover change, the biophysical 
annual cooling (about –0.20°C to –0.22°C on land, –0.06°C globally) 
is significantly dampened by the warming (about +0.13°C) resulting 
from the movements of natural vegetation (Strengers et al. 2010). 
Accounting simultaneously for both anthropogenic and natural land 
cover changes reduces the cooling impacts of historical land cover 
change in this specific study.
At the regional level
The global and annual estimates reported above mask out very 
contrasted regional and seasonal differences. Biogeochemical 
effects of anthropogenic land cover change on temperature 
follow the spatial patterns of GHG-driven climate change with 
stronger warming over land than ocean, and stronger warming 
in northern high latitudes than in the tropics and equatorial 
regions (Arctic amplification). Biophysical effects on the contrary 
are much stronger where land cover has been modified than in 
their surroundings (see Section 2.5.4 for a discussion on non-local 
effects). Very contrasted regional temperature changes can thus 
result, depending on whether biophysical processes dampen or 
exacerbate biogeochemical impacts. 
Figure 2.15 compares, for seven climate models, the biophysical 
effects of historical anthropogenic land cover change in North 
America and Eurasia (essentially cooling) to the regional warming 
resulting from the increased atmospheric CO2 content since pre-
industrial times (De Noblet-Ducoudré et  al. 2012; comparing 
173

1973–2002 to 1871–1900). It shows a dominant biophysical 
cooling effect of changes in land cover, at all seasons, as large 
as the regional footprint of anthropogenic global warming. 
Averaged over all agricultural areas of the world (Pongratz et al. 
2010) reported a 20th century biophysical cooling of –0.10°C, and 
Strengers et al. (2010) reported a land induced cooling as large as 
–1.5°C in western Russia and eastern China between 1871 and 
2007. There is thus medium confi dence that anthropogenic land 
cover change has dampened warming in many regions of the world 
over the historical period.
Very few studies have explored the effects of historical land cover 
changes on seasonal climate. There is, however, evidence that the 
seasonal magnitude and sign of those effects at the regional level 
are strongly related to soil-moisture/evapotranspiration and snow 
regimes, particularly in temperate and boreal latitudes (Teuling et al. 
2010; Pitman and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2012; Alkama and Cescatti 
2016). Quesada et al. (2017a) showed that atmospheric circulation 
changes can be signifi cantly strengthened in winter for tropical and 
temperate regions. However, the lack of studies underlines the need 
for a more systematic assessment of seasonal, regional and other-
than-mean-temperature metrics in the future.

values. Seasons are respectively December-January-February (DJF), March-April-May (MAM), June-July-August (JJA) and September-October-November (SON). North America 
and Eurasia are extended regions where land-use changes are the largest between the two time periods considered (their contours can be found in Figure 1 of De Noblet-
Ducoudré et al. (2012).
Effects on extremes 
The effect of historical deforestation on extreme temperature trends 
is intertwined with the effect of other climate forcings, thus making 
it difficult to quantify based on observations. Based on results 
from four climate models, the impact of historical anthropogenic 
land cover change on temperature and precipitation extremes was 
found to be locally as important as changes arising from increases 
in atmospheric CO2 and sea-surface temperatures, but with a lack 
of model agreement on the sign of changes (Pitman et al. 2012). In 
some regions, the impact of land cover change masks or amplifies the 
effect of increased CO2 on extremes (Avila et al. 2012; Christidis et al. 
2013). Using an observational constraint for the local biophysical 
effect of land cover change applied to a set of CMIP5 climate models, 
Lejeune et al. (2018) found that historical deforestation increased 
extreme hot temperatures in northern mid-latitudes. The results also 
indicate a stronger impact on the warmest temperatures compared to 
mean temperatures. Findell et al. (2017) reached similar conclusions, 
although using only a single climate model. Importantly, the climate 
models involved in these three studies did not consider the effect of 
management changes, which have been shown to be important, as 
discussed in Section 2.5.2.
Based on the studies discussed above, there is limited evidence but 
high agreement that land cover change affects local temperature 
extremes more than mean values. Observational studies assessing 
the role of land cover on temperature extremes are still very limited 
(Zaitchik et al. 2006; Renaud and Rebetez 2008), but suggest that 
trees dampen seasonal and diurnal temperature variations at all 
latitudes, and even more so in temperate regions compared to short 
vegetation (Chen et al. 2018; Duveiller et al. 2018; Li et al. 2015a; 
Lee et al. 2011). Furthermore, trees also locally dampen the amplitude 
of heat extremes (Renaud and Rebetez 2008; Zaitchik et al. 2006) 
although this result depends on the forest type, coniferous trees 
providing less cooling effect than broadleaf trees (Renaud et al. 2011; 
Renaud and Rebetez 2008). 
2.5.1.2 
Impacts of future global land cover changes 
on climate
At the global level
The most extreme CMIP5 emissions scenario, RCP8.5, has received 
the most attention in the literature with respect to how projected 
future anthropogenic land use land cover changes (Hurtt et al. 2011) 
will affect the highest levels of global warming.
Seven model-based studies have examined both the biophysical 
and biogeochemical effects of anthropogenic changes in land cover, 
as projected in RCP8.5, on future climate change (Simmons and 
Matthews 2016; Davies-Barnard et  al. 2014; Boysen et  al. 2014) 
(Table 2.5). They all agree on a biogeochemical warming, ranging 
from +0.04°C to +0.35°C, in response to land cover change. Two 
models predict an additional biophysical warming, while the 
others agree on a biophysical cooling that dampens (or overrules) 
the biogeochemical warming. Using a wider range of global 
175
Land–climate interactions  
Chapter 2
2
climate models, the biogeochemical warming (high confidence) is 
+0.20 ± 0.15°C whereas it is +0.28 ± 0.11°C when estimated from 
DGVMs (Pugh et al. 2015; Stocker et al. 2014). This biogeochemical 
warming is compensated for by a biophysical cooling (medium 
confidence) of –0.10 ± 0.14°C (Quesada et al. 2017a; Davies-Barnard 
et al. 2015; Boysen et al. 2014). The estimates of temperature changes 
resulting from anthropogenic land cover changes alone remain very 
small compared to the projected mean warming of +3.7°C by the 
end of the 21st century (ranging from 2.6°C–4.8°C depending on the 
model and compared to 1986–2005; Figure 2.14).
Two other projected land cover change scenarios have been examined 
(RCP4.5 and RCP2.6; Table 2.5; Figure 2.14) but only one climate 
modelling experiment has been carried out for each, to estimate the 
biophysical impacts on climate of those changes (Davies-Barnard 
et al. 2015). For RCP2.6, ESMs and DGVMs agree on a systematic 
biogeochemical warming resulting from the imposed land cover 
changes, ranging from +0.03 to +0.28°C (Brovkin et al. 2013), which 
is significant compared to the projected mean climate warming of 
+1°C by the end of the 21st century (ranging from 0.3°C–1.7°C 
depending on the models, compared to 1986–2005). A very small 
amount of biophysical cooling is expected from the one estimate. For 
RCP4.5, biophysical warming is expected from only one estimate, and 
results from a projected large forestation in the temperate and high 
latitudes. There is no agreement on the sign of the biogeochemical 
effect: there are as many studies predicting cooling as warming, 
whichever the method to compute those effects (ESMs or DGVMs).
Previous scenarios  – Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) 
results of climate studies using those scenarios were reported in AR4 – 
displayed larger land use changes than the more recent ones (RCP, AR5). 
There is low confidence from some of those previous scenarios (SRES A2 
and B1) of a small warming effect (+0.2 to +0.3°C) of anthropogenic 
land cover change on mean global climate, this being dominated by 
the release of CO2 in the atmosphere from land conversions (Sitch et al. 
2005). This additional warming remains quite small when compared 
to the one resulting from the combined anthropogenic influences 
(+1.7°C for SRES B1 and +2.7°C for SRES A2). A global biophysical 
cooling of –0.14°C is estimated in response to the extreme land cover 
change projected in SRES A2, a value that far exceeds the impacts 
of historical land use changes (–0.05°C) calculated using the same 
climate model (Davin et al. 2007). The authors derived a biophysical 
climatic sensitivity to land use change of about –0.3°C W.m–2 for their 
model, whereas a warming of about 1°C W.m–2 is obtained in response 
to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. 
Those studies generally do not report on changes in atmospheric 
variables other than surface air temperature, thereby limiting our 
ability to assess the effects of anthropogenic land cover changes 
on regional climate (Sitch et  al. 2005). However, small reductions 
reported in rainfall via changes in biophysical properties of the land, 
following the massive tropical deforestation in SRES A2 (+0.5 and 
+0.25 mm day–1 respectively in the Amazon and Central Africa). They 
also report opposite changes – that is, increased rainfall of about 
0.25 mm day–1 across the entire tropics and subtropics, triggered by 
biogeochemical effects of this same deforestation.
At the regional level
In regions that will undergo land cover changes, dampening of 
the future anthropogenic warming can be as large as –26% while 
enhancement is always smaller than 9% within RCP8.5 by the end of 
the 21st century (Boysen et al. 2014). Voldoire (2006) shows that, by 
2050, and following the SRES B2 scenario, the contribution of land 
cover changes to the total temperature change can be as large as 
15% in many boreal regions, and as large as 40% in south-western 
tropical Africa. Feddema et al. (2005) simulate large decreases in the 
diurnal temperature range in the future (2050 and 2100 in SRES B1 
and A2) following tropical deforestation in both scenarios. In the 
Amazon, for example, the diurnal temperature range is lowered by 
2.5°C due to increases in minimum temperature, while little change 
is obtained for the maximum value.
There is thus medium evidence that future anthropogenic land cover 
change will have a significant effect on regional temperature via 
biophysical effects in many regions of the world. There is, however, no 
agreement on whether warming will be dampened or enhanced, and 
there is no agreement on the sign of the contribution across regions.
There are very few studies that go beyond analysing the changes in 
mean surface air temperature. Some studies attempted to look at 
global changes in rainfall and found no significant influence of future 
land cover changes (Brovkin et al. 2013; Sitch et al. 2005; Feddema 
et al. 2005). Quesada et al. (2017a, b) however carried out a systematic 
multi-model analysis of the response of a number of atmospheric, 
radiative and hydrological variables (e.g., rainfall, sea level pressure, 
Table 2.5 |   Change in mean global annual surface air temperature resulting from anthropogenic land cover changes projected for the future, according 
to three different scenarios: RCP8.5, RCP4.5 and RCP2.6. Temperature changes resulting from biophysical and biogeochemical effects of land cover change 
are examined.

shortwave and longwave radiation, cloudiness) to RCP8.5 land cover 
scenario. In particular, they found a significant reduction of rainfall 
in six out of eight monsoon regions studied (Figure 2.16) of about 
1.9–3% (which means more than –0.5 mm day–1 in some areas) 
in response to future anthropogenic land cover changes. Including 
those changes in global climate models reduces the projected 
increase in rainfall by about 9–41% in those same regions, when 
all anthropogenic forcings are accounted for (30% in the global 
monsoon region as defined by Wang and Ding (2008)). In addition, 
they found a shortening of the monsoon season of one to four days. 
They conclude that the projected future increase in monsoon rains may 
be overestimated by those models that do not yet include biophysical 
effects of land cover changes. Overall, the regional hydrological cycle 
was found to be substantially reduced and wind speed significantly 
strengthened in response to regional deforestation within the tropics, 
with magnitude comparable to projected changes with all forcings 
(Quesada et al. 2017b).

The term ‘forestation’ is used herein as this chapter does not distinguish between afforestation and reforestation. In model-based studies, simulations with and without 
trees are compared; in observation-based estimates, sites with and without trees are compared. 
Effects on extremes
Results from a set of climate models have shown that the impact of 
future anthropogenic land cover change on extreme temperatures 
can be of similar magnitude as the changes arising from half a degree 
global mean annual surface temperature change (Hirsch et al. 2018). 
However, this study also found a lack of agreement between models 
with respect to the magnitude and sign of changes, thus making land 
cover change a factor of uncertainty in future climate projections.

an opposite effect (dampening) on rainfall compared to the effects of all anthropogenic changes. Monsoon regions have been defined following Yim et al. (2014). The changes 
have been simulated by five climate models (Brovkin et al. 2013). Results are shown for December-January-February for southern hemisphere regions, and for June-July-August 
for northern hemisphere regions. Statistical significance is given by blue tick marks and circles: one, two and three blue tick marks are displayed for the regions where at least 
80% of the climate models have regional changes significant at the 66th, 75th and 80th confidence level, respectively; blue circles are added when the regional values are also

small future projected changes in South American monsoon rainfall.

CO2 and other GHGs in the atmosphere (biogeochemical impact) and 
subsequent increase in incoming infrared radiation at surface 
(greenhouse effect), (ii) a decrease in the total loss of energy through 
turbulent fl uxes (latent and sensible heat fl uxes) resulting from reduced 
surface roughness, (iii) an increased incoming solar radiation following 
reduced cloudiness that often (but not always) accompanies the 
decreased total evapotranspiration. Cooling occurs in response to 
(iv) increased surface albedo that reduces the amount of absorbed 
solar radiation, (v) reduced incoming infrared radiation triggered by the 
decreased evapotranspiration and subsequent decrease in atmospheric 
water vapour. Points ii–v are referred to as biophysical effects. 
Deforestation and forestation also alter rainfall and winds (horizontal 
as well as vertical, as will be further discussed below). 
The literature that discusses the effects of forestation on climate is 
more limited than for deforestation, but they reveal a similar climatic 
response with opposite sign, as further discussed below. For each 
latitudinal band (tropical, temperate and boreal) we look at how very 
large-scale deforestation or forestation impacts on the global mean 
climate, followed by an examination of the large-scale changes in the 
specifi c latitudinal band, and fi nally more regionally focused analysis. 
Large-scale idealised deforestation or forestation experiments are often 
carried out with global or regional climate models as they allow us to 
understand and measure how sensitive climate is to very large changes 
in land cover (similar to the instant doubling of CO2 in climate models 
to calculate the climatic sensitivity to GHGs). Details of the model-based 
studies discussed below can be found in Table A2.2 in the Appendix.
Global and regional impacts of deforestation/forestation 
in tropical regions
A pan-tropical deforestation would lead to the net release of CO2 from 
land, and thus to mean global annual warming, with model-based 
estimates of biogeochemical effects ranging from +0.19 to +1.06°C, 
with a mean value of +0.53 ± 0.32°C (Ganopolski et al. 2001; Snyder 
et al. 2004; Devaraju et al. 2015a; Longobardi et al. 2016; Perugini 
et al. 2017). There is, however, no agreement between models on the 
magnitude and sign of the biophysical effect of such changes at the 
global scale (the range spans from –0.5°C to +0.7°C with a mean 
value of +0.1 ± 0.27°C) (e.g., Devaraju et al. (2015b), Snyder (2010), 
Longobardi et al. (2016a)) (Figure 2.17). This is the result of many 
compensation effects in action: increased surface albedo following 
deforestation, decreased atmospheric water vapour content due to 
less tropical evapotranspiration, and decreased loss of energy from 
tropical land in the form of latent and sensible heat fl uxes. 
There is, however, high confi dence that such large land cover change 
would lead to a mean biophysical warming when averaged over the

deforested land. A mean warming of +0.61 ± 0.48°C is found over 
the entire tropics. On the other hand, biophysical regional cooling 
and global warming is expected from forestation (Wang et al. 2014b; 
Bathiany et al. 2010).
Large-scale deforestation (whether pan-tropical or imposed at the 
sub-continent level, e.g., the Amazon) results in significant mean 
rainfall decrease (Lawrence and Vandecar 2015; Lejeune et al. 2015; 
Perugini et al. 2017). In their review, Perugini et al. (2017) reported an 
average simulated decrease of –288 ± 75 mm yr–1 (95% confidence 
interval). Inversely large-scale forestation increases tropical rainfall 
by 41 ± 21 mm yr–1. The magnitude of the change in precipitation 
strongly depends on the type of land cover conversion. For instance, 
conversion of tropical forest to bare soil causes larger reductions 
in regional precipitation than conversion to pasture (respectively 
–470  ± 60 mm yr–1 and –220 ± 100 mm yr–1). Biogeochemical 
effects in response to pan-tropical deforestation, particularly CO2 
release, are generally not taken into account in those studies, but 
could intensify the hydrological cycle and thus precipitation (Kendra 
Gotangco Castillo and Gurney 2013).
Specific model-based deforestation studies have been carried out 
for Africa (Hagos et al. 2014; Boone et al. 2016; Xue et al. 2016; 
Nogherotto et  al. 2013; Hartley et  al. 2016; Klein et  al. 2017; 
Abiodun et al. 2012), southern America (Butt et al. 2011; Wu et al. 
2017; Spracklen and Garcia-Carreras 2015; Lejeune et al. 2015) and 
Southeast Asia (Ma et al. 2013b; Werth and Avissar 2005; Mabuchi 
et al. 2005; Tölle et al. 2017). All found decreases in evapotranspiration 
following deforestation (high agreement), resulting in surface 
warming, despite the competing effect from increased surface albedo 
(high agreement). Changes in thermal gradients between deforested 
and adjacent regions, between land and ocean, affect horizontal 
surface winds (high agreement) and thus modify the areas where 
rain falls, as discussed in Section 2.5.4. An increase in the land-sea 
thermal contrast has been found in many studies as surface friction is 
reduced by deforestation, thus increasing the monsoon flow in Africa 
and South America (Wu et al. 2017).
Observation-based estimates all agree that deforestation increases 
local land-surface and ambient air temperatures in the tropics, while 
forestation has the reverse effect (very high confidence) (Prevedello 
et al. 2019; Schultz et al. 2017; Li et al. 2015b; Alkama and Cescatti 
2016). There is very high confidence that forests are cooler than any 
shorter vegetation (crops, grasses, bare soil) during daytime due 
to larger transpiration rates, and there is high confidence that the 
amplitude of the diurnal cycle is smaller in the presence of forests.
Large-scale forestation scenarios of West Africa (Abiodun et al. 2012), 
eastern China (Ma et al. 2013a) or the Saharan and Australian deserts 
(Ornstein et al. 2009; Kemena et al. 2017) all concluded that regional 
surface cooling is simulated wherever trees are grown (–2.5°C in 
the Sahel, –1°C in the savanna area of West Africa, up to –8°C in 
the western Sahara and –1.21°C over land in eastern China) while 
cooling of the ambient air is smaller (–0.16°C). In the case of savanna 
forestation, this decrease entirely compensates the GHG-induced 
future warming (+1°C following the SRES A1B scenario). West African 
countries thus have the potential to reduce, or even totally cancel in 
some places, the GHG-induced warming in the deforested regions 
(Abiodun et al. 2012). However, this is compensated by enhanced 
warming in adjacent countries (non-local effect). 
Global and regional impacts of deforestation/forestation 
in temperate regions
As for the tropics, model-based experiments show that large-
scale temperate deforestation would induce a small mean 
global annual warming through the net release of CO2 into the 
atmosphere (ranging from +0.10 to +0.40°C with a mean value 
of +0.20 ± 0.13°C) (Figure 2.17), whereas there is less agreement 
on the sign of the mean global annual temperature change 
resulting from biophysical processes: estimates range from –0.5°C 
to +0.18°C with a mean value of –0.13 ± 0.22°C. There is also 
very low agreement on the mean annual temperature change in 
the temperate zone (–0.4  ±  0.62°C; Phillips et  al. 2007; Snyder 
et al. 2004; Longobardi et al. 2016a; Devaraju et al. 2015a, 2018). 
There is medium agreement on a global and latitudinal biophysical 
warming in response to forestation (Laguë and Swann 2016; Swann 
et al. 2012; Gibbard et al. 2005; Wang et al. 2014b) (Figure 2.17), 
but this is based on a smaller number of studies.
The lack of agreement at the annual scale among the climate models 
is, however, masking rising agreement regarding seasonal impacts of 
deforestation at those latitudes. There is high agreement that temperate 
deforestation leads to summer warming and winter cooling (Bright 
et al. 2017; Zhao and Jackson 2014; Gálos et al. 2011, 2013; Wickham 
et al. 2013; Ahlswede and Thomas 2017; Anderson-Teixeira et al. 2012; 
Anderson et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012; Strandberg and Kjellström 2018). 
The winter cooling is driven by the increased surface albedo, amplified 
by the snow-albedo feedback. In some models, and when deforestation 
is simulated for very large areas, the cooling is further amplified by 
high latitude changes in sea-ice and snow extent (polar amplification). 
Summer warming occurs because the latent and sensible heat fluxes that 
take energy out of the surface diminish with the smaller roughness length 
and lower evapotranspiration efficiency of low vegetation, as compared 
to tree canopies (Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudre 2010; Anav et al. 2010). 
Conversely, there is high agreement that forestation in North America 
or in Europe cools surface climate during summer time, especially in 
regions where water availability can support large evapotranspiration 
rates. In temperate regions with water deficits, the simulated change in 
evapotranspiration following forestation will be insignificant, while the 
decreased surface albedo will favour surface warming.
Observation-based estimates confirm the existence of a seasonal 
pattern of response to deforestation, with colder winters any time 
there is snow on the ground and in any place where soils are brighter 
than the trees, and warmer summers (Schultz et al. 2017; Wickham 
et al. 2014; Juang et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2018; Peng et al. 2014; 
Zhang et al. 2014b; Prevedello et al. 2019; Li et al. 2015b; Alkama 
and Cescatti 2016). In contrast, forestation induces cooler summers 
wherever trees have access to sufficient soil moisture to transpire. 
The magnitude of the cooling depends on the wetness of the area of 
concern (Wickham et al. 2013) as well as on the original and targeted 
species and varieties implicated in the vegetation conversion 
(Peng et al. 2014; Juang et al. 2007). 
179
Land–climate interactions  
Chapter 2

There is also high confidence from observation-based estimates 
that mean annual daytime temperatures are warmer following 
deforestation, while night-time temperatures are cooler (Schultz 
et al. 2017; Wickham et al. 2014; Juang et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2018; 
Prevedello et al. 2019; Peng et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014b; Li et al. 
2015b; Alkama and Cescatti 2016). Deforestation then increases the 
amplitude of diurnal temperature variations while forestation reduces it 
(high confidence). Two main reasons have been put forward to explain 
why nights are warmer in forested areas: their larger capacity to store 
heat and the existence of a nocturnal temperature inversion bringing 
warmer air from the higher atmospheric levels down to the surface.
In addition to those seasonal and diurnal fluctuations, Lejeune 
et al. (2018) found systematic warming of the hottest summer days 
following historical deforestation in the northern mid-latitudes, and 
this echoes Strandberg and Kjellström (2018) who argue that the 
August 2003 and July 2010 heatwaves could have been largely 
mitigated if Europe had been largely forested. 
In a combined modelling of large-scale forestation of western Europe 
and climate change scenario (SRES A2), Gálos et al. (2013) found 
relatively small dampening potential of additional forest on ambient 
air temperature at the end of the 21st century when compared to the 
beginning (the cooling resulting from land cover changes is –0.5°C 
whereas the GHG-induced warming exceeds 2.5°C). Influence on 
rainfall was, however, much larger and significant. Projected annual 
rainfall decreases following warming were cancelled in Germany and 
significantly reduced in both France and Ukraine through forestation. 
In addition, forestation decreased the number of warming-induced 
dry days but increased the number of extreme precipitation events. 
The net impact of forestation, combining both biophysical and 
biogeochemical effects, has been tested in the warmer world predicted 
by RCP 8.5 scenario (Sonntag et al. 2016, 2018). The cooling effect 
from the addition of 8 Mkm2 of forests following the land use RCP 
4.5 scenario was too small (–0.27°C annually) to dampen the RCP 8.5 
warming. However, it reached about –1°C in some temperate regions 
and –2.5°C in boreal ones. This is accompanied by a reduction in the 
number of extremely warm days.
Global and regional impacts of deforestation/forestation 
in boreal regions
Consistent with what we have previously discussed for 
temperate and tropical regions, large-scale boreal deforestation 
induces a biogeochemical warming of +0.11 ± 0.09°C 
(Figure  2.17). But contrary to those other latitudinal bands, 
the biophysical effect is a consistent cooling across all models  
(–0.55 ± 0.29°C when averaged globally). It is also significantly larger 
than the biogeochemical warming (e.g., Dass et al. (2013), Longobardi 
et al. (2016a), Devaraju et al. (2015a), Bathiany et al. (2010), Devaraju 
et al. (2018)) and is driven by the increased albedo, enhanced by the 
snow-albedo feedback as well as by an increase in sea-ice extent in 
the Arctic. Over boreal lands, the cooling is as large as –1.8 ± 1.2°C. 
However, this means that annual cooling masks a seasonal contrast, 
as discussed in Strandberg and Kjellström (2018) and Gao et al. (2014): 
during summer time, following the removal of forest, the decreased 
evapotranspiration results in a significant summer warming that 
outweighs the effect of an increased albedo effect.
The same observation-based estimates (as discussed in the previous 
subsection) show similar patterns for the temperate latitudes: 
seasonal and daily contrasts. Schultz et al. (2017), however, found 
that mean annual night-time changes are as large as daytime ones 
in those regions (mean annual nocturnal cooling of –1.4 ± 0.10°C, 
balanced by mean annual daytime warming of 1.4 ± 0.04°C). This 
contrasts with both temperate and tropical regions where daytime 
changes are always larger than the night-time ones. 
Arora and Montenegro (2011) combined large-scale forestation and 
climate change scenario (SRES A2): forestation of either 50% or 
100% of the total agricultural area was gradually prescribed between 
years 2011 and 2060 everywhere. In addition, boreal, temperate and 
tropical forestation have been tested separately. Both biophysical 
and biogeochemical effects were accounted for. The net simulated 
impact of forestation was a cooling varying from –0.04°C to –0.45°C, 
depending on the location and magnitude of the additional forest 
cover. It was, however, quite marginal compared to the large global 
warming resulting from anthropogenic GHG emissions (+3°C at the 
end of the 21st century). In their experiment, forestation in boreal 
regions led to biophysical warming and biogeochemical cooling that 
compensated each other, whereas forestation in the tropics led to 
both biophysical and biogeochemical cooling. The authors concluded 
that tropical forestation is three times more effective at cooling down 
climate than boreal or temperate forestation. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, planting trees will always result in capturing more 
atmospheric CO2, and thus will mean annual cooling of the globe 
(very high confidence). At the regional level, however, the magnitude 
and sign of the local temperature change depends on (i) where 
forestation occurs, (ii) its magnitude, (iii) the level of warming 
under which the land cover change is applied, and (iv) the land 
conversion type. This is because the background climatic conditions 
(e.g.,  precipitation and snow regimes, mean annual temperature) 
within which the land cover changes occur vary across regions 
(Pitman et  al. 2011; Montenegro et  al. 2009; Juang et  al. 2007; 
Wickham et  al. 2014; Hagos et  al. 2014; Voldoire 2006; Feddema 
et al. 2005; Strandberg and Kjellström 2018). In addition, there is 
high confidence that estimates of the influence of any land cover or 
land use change on surface temperature from the sole consideration 
of the albedo and the CO2 effects is incorrect as changes in turbulent 
fluxes (i.e., latent and sensible heat fluxes) are large contributors to 
local temperature change (Bright et al. 2017).
There is high confidence that, in boreal and temperate latitudes, the 
presence of forest cools temperature in warmer locations and seasons 
(provided that the soil is not dry), whereas it warms temperature in 
colder locations and seasons (provided the soil is brighter than the 
trees or covered with snow). In the humid tropics, forestation increases 
evapotranspiration year-round and thus decreases temperature (high 
confidence). In tropical areas with a strong seasonality of rainfall, 
forestation will also increase evapotranspiration year-round, unless 
180

the soil becomes too dry. In all regions there is medium confidence 
that the diurnal temperature range decreases with increasing forest 
cover, with potentially reduced extreme values of temperature.
Although there is not enough literature yet that rigorously compares 
both biophysical and biogeochemical effects of realistic scenarios 
of forestation, there is high confidence that, at the local scale (that 
is where the forest change occurs), biophysical effects on surface 
temperature are far more important than the effects resulting from 
the changes in emitted CO2.
What is lacking in the literature today is an estimate of the impacts 
that natural disturbances in forests will have on local climates and on 
the build-up of atmospheric CO2 (O’Halloran et al. 2012), illustrated 
with many examples that changes in albedo following disturbances 
can result in radiative forcing changes opposite to, and as large as, 
the ones resulting from the associated changes in the net release of 
CO2 by land. The resulting climate effects depend on the duration 
of the perturbation and of the following recovery of vegetation. 
2.5.2.2 
Impacts of changes in land management
There have been little changes in net cropland area over the past 
50 years (at the global scale) compared to continuous changes in 
land management (Erb et al. 2017). Similarly, in Europe, change in 
forest management has resulted in a very significant anthropogenic 
land change. Management affects water, energy and GHG fluxes 
exchanged between the land and the atmosphere, and thus affects 
temperature and rainfall, sometimes to the same extent as changes 
in land cover do (as discussed in Luyssaert et al. (2014)). 
The effects of irrigation, which is a practice that has been substantially 
studied, including one attempt to manage solar radiation via 
increases in cropland albedo (geoengineering the land) are assessed, 
along with a discussion of recent findings on the effects of forest 
management on local climate, although there is not enough literature 
yet on this topic to carry out a thorough assessment. The effects of 
urbanisation on climate are assessed in a specific cross-chapter box 
within this chapter (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in this chapter).
There are a number of other practices that exist whose importance for 
climate mitigation has been examined (some are reported in Section 2.6 
and Chapter 6). There is, however, not enough literature available for 
assessing their biophysical effect on climate. Few papers are generally 
found per agricultural practice, for example, Jeong et al. (2014b) for 
double cropping, Bagley et al. (2017) for the timing of the growing 
season and Erb et al. (2017) for a review of 10 management practices. 
Similarly, there are very few studies that have examined how choosing 
species varieties and harvesting strategies in forest management 
impacts on climate through biophysical effects, and how those effects 
compare to the consequences of the chosen strategies on the net 
CO2 sink of the managed forest. The modelling studies highlight the 
existence of competing effects, for example, between the capacity 
of certain species to store more carbon than others (thus inducing 
cooling) while at the same time reducing the total evapotranspiration 
loss and absorbing more solar radiation via lower albedo (thus 
inducing warming) (Naudts et al. 2016a; Luyssaert et al. 2018). 
Irrigation
There is substantial literature on the effects of irrigation on local, 
regional and global climate as this is a major land management 
issue. There is very high confidence that irrigation increases total 
evapotranspiration, increases the total amount of water vapour in the 
atmosphere and decreases mean surface daytime temperature within 
the irrigated area and during the time of irrigation (Bonfils and Lobell 
2007; Alter et al. 2015; Chen and Jeong 2018; Christy et al. 2006; Im 
and Eltahir 2014; Im et al. 2014; Mueller et al. 2015). Decreases in 
maximum daytime temperature can locally be as large as –3°C to 
–8°C (Cook et al. 2015; Han and Yang 2013; Huber et al. 2014; Alter 
et al. 2015; Im et al. 2014). Estimates of the contribution of irrigation 
to past historical trends in ambient air temperature vary between 
–0.07°C and –0.014°C/decade in northern China (Han  and Yang 
2013; Chen and Jeong 2018) while being quite larger in California, 
USA (–0.14°C to –0.25°C/decade) (Bonfils and Lobell 2007). Surface 
cooling results from increased energy being taken up from the land via 
larger evapotranspiration rates. In addition, there is growing evidence 
from modelling studies that such cooling can locally mitigate the effect 
of heatwaves (Thiery et al. 2017; Mueller et al. 2015). 
There is no agreement on changes in night-time temperatures, as 
discussed in Chen and Jeong (2018) who summarised the findings 
from observations in many regions of the world (India, China, 
North America and eastern Africa) (Figure 2.18). Where night-time 
warming is found (Chen and Jeong 2018; Christy et al. 2006), two 
explanations are put forward, (i) an increase in incoming longwave 
radiation in response to increased atmospheric water vapour content 
(greenhouse effect), and (ii) an increased storage of heat in the soil 
during daytime. Because of the larger heat capacity of moister soil, 
heat is then released to the atmosphere at night.
There is robust evidence from modelling studies that implementing 
irrigation enhances rainfall, although there is very low confidence 
on where this increase occurs. When irrigation occurs in Sahelian 
Africa during the monsoon period, rainfall is decreased over irrigated 
areas (high agreement), increased in the southwest if the crops are 
located in western Africa (Alter et  al. 2015) and increased in the 
east/northeast when crops are located further east in Sudan (Im and 
Eltahir 2014; Im et al. 2014) The cooler irrigated surfaces in the Sahel, 
because of their greater evapotranspiration, inhibit convection and 
create an anomalous descending motion over crops that suppresses 
rainfall but influences the circulation of monsoon winds. Irrigation 
in India occurs prior to the start of the monsoon season and the 
resulting land cooling decreases the land-sea temperature contrast. 
This can delay the onset of the Indian monsoon and decrease its 
intensity (Niyogi et al. 2010; Guimberteau et al. 2012). Results from 
a modelling study by De Vrese et al. (2016) suggest that part of the 
excess rainfall triggered by Indian irrigation falls westward, in the 
horn of Africa. The theory behind those local and downwind changes 
in rainfall support the findings from the models, but we do not yet 
have sufficient literature to robustly assess the magnitude and exact 
location of the expected changes driven by irrigation.

Cropland albedo
Various methods have been proposed to increase surface albedo 
in cropland and thus reduce local surface temperature (high 
confidence): choose ‘brighter’ crop varieties (Ridgwell et  al. 2009; 
Crook et al. 2015; Hirsch et al. 2017; Singarayer et al. 2009; Singarayer 
and Davies-Barnard 2012), abandon tillage (Lobell et al. 2006; Davin 
et al. 2014), include cover crops into rotation in areas where soils are 
darker than vegetation (Carrer et al. 2018; Kaye and Quemada 2017) 
or use greenhouses (as in Campra et al. (2008)). See Seneviratne et al. 
(2018) for a review.
Whatever the solution chosen, the induced reduction in absorbed 
solar radiation cools the land – more specifically during the hottest 
summer days (low confidence) (Davin et al. 2014; Wilhelm et al. 2015; 
Figure 2.19). Changes in temperature are essentially local and seasonal 
(limited to crop growth season) or sub-seasonal (when resulting from 
inclusion of cover crop or tillage suppression). Such management action 
on incoming solar radiation thus holds the potential to counteract 
warming in cultivated areas during crop growing season. 
Introducing cover crops into a rotation can also have a warming 
effect in areas where vegetation has a darker albedo than soil, or 
in winter during snow periods if the cover crops or their residues 
are tall enough to overtop the snow cover (Kaye and Quemada 
2017; Lombardozzi et  al. 2018). In addition, evapotranspiration 
greater than that of bare soil during this transitional period reduces 
soil temperature (Ceschia et al. 2017). Such management strategy 
can have another substantial mitigation effect as it allows carbon 
to be stored in the soil and to reduce both direct and indirect N2O

emissions (Basche et al. 2014; Kaye and Quemada 2017), in particular 
if fertilisation of the subsequent crop is reduced (Constantin et al. 
2010, 2011). The use of cover crops thus substantially improves the 
GHG budget of croplands (Kaye and Quemada 2017; Tribouillois 
et al. 2018). More discussion on the role of management practices 
for mitigation can be found in Section 2.6 and Chapter 6.
Only a handful of modelling studies have looked at effects other 
than changes in atmospheric temperature in response to increased 
cropland albedo. Seneviratne et al. (2018) have found significant 
changes in rainfall following an idealised increase in cropland 
albedo, especially within the Asian monsoon regions. The benefits 
of cooler temperature on production, resulting from increased 
albedo, is cancelled out by decreases in rainfall that are harmful 
for crop productivity. The rarity of a concomitant evaluation of 
albedo management impact on crop productivity prevents us from 
providing a robust assessment of this practice in terms of both 
climate mitigation and food security. 
2.5.3 
Amplifying/dampening climate changes 
via land responses
Section 2.1 and Box 2.1 illustrate the various ways through which 
land can affect the atmosphere and thereby climate and weather. 
Section 2.2 illustrates the many impacts that climate changes have 
on the functioning of land ecosystems. Section 2.3 discusses the 
effects that future climatic conditions have on the capacity of the 
land to absorb anthropogenic CO2, which then controls the sign 
of the feedback to the initial global warming. Sections 2.5.1 and 
2.5.2 show the effects of changes in anthropogenic land cover or 
land management on climate variables or processes. Therefore, land 
has the potential to dampen or amplify the GHG-induced global 
climate warming, or can be used as a tool to mitigate regional 
climatic consequences of global warming such as extreme weather 
events, in addition to increasing the capacity of land to absorb CO2 
(Figure 2.20). 
Land-to-climate feedbacks are difficult to assess with global or 
regional climate models, as both types of models generally omit 
a large number of processes. Among these are (i) the response of 
vegetation to climate change in terms of growth, productivity, and 
geographical distribution, (ii) the dynamics of major disturbances 
such as fires, (iii) the nutrients dynamics, and (iv) the dynamics 
and effects of short-lived chemical tracers such as biogenic volatile 
organic compounds (Section 2.4). Therefore, only those processes 
that are fully accounted for in climate models are considered here.
2.5.3.1 
Effects of changes in land cover and productivity 
resulting from global warming
In boreal regions, the combined northward migration of the treeline 
and increased growing season length in response to increased 
temperatures in those regions (Section 2.2) will have positive 
feedbacks both on global and regional annual warming (high 
confidence) (Garnaud and Sushama 2015; Jeong et  al. 2014a; 
O’ishi and Abe-Ouchi 2009; Port et al. 2012; Strengers et al. 2010).

the dominant signal in all modelling studies at the annual timescale 
and during the snow season, while cooling is obtained during the 
growing season (Section 2.5.2.1 and Figure 2.21, right panel). 
In the tropics, climate change will cause both greening and browning 
(Section 2.2). Where global warming provokes a decrease in rainfall, 
the induced decrease in biomass production leads to increased local 
warming (high confidence) (Port et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2016; Yu et al. 
2016). The reverse is true where warming generates increases in rainfall 
and thus greening. As an example, Port et al. (2012) simulated decreases 
in tree cover and shortened growing season in the Amazon, despite the 
CO2 fertilisation effects, in response to both future tropical warming 
and reduced precipitation (Figure 2.21, left panel). This browning of 
the land decreases both evapotranspiration and atmospheric humidity. 
The warming driven by the drop in evapotranspiration is enhanced via 
a decrease in cloudiness, increasing solar radiation, and is dampened 
by reduced water vapour greenhouse radiation. 
There is very low confidence on how feedbacks affect rainfall in 
the tropics where vegetation changes may occur, as the sign of the 
change in precipitation depends on where the greening occurs and 
on the season (as discussed in Section 2.5.2). There is, however, high 
confidence that increased vegetation growth in the southern Sahel 
increases African monsoon rains (Yu et al. 2016; Port et al. 2012; 
Wu et al. 2016). Confidence on the direction of such feedbacks is also 
based on a significant number of paleoclimate studies that analysed 
how vegetation dynamics helped maintain a northward position of 
the African monsoon during the Holocene time period (9–6 kyr BP) 
(de Noblet-Ducoudré et al. 2000; Rachmayani et al. 2015).
2.5.3.2 
Feedbacks to climate from high-latitude 
land-surface changes 
In high latitudes, snow albedo and permafrost carbon feedbacks are 
the most well-known and most important surface-related climate 
feedbacks because of their large-scale impacts.
In response to ongoing and projected decrease in seasonal snow cover 
(Derksen and Brown 2012; Brutel-Vuilmet et al. 2013) warming is, 
and will continue to be, enhanced in boreal regions (high confidence) 
(Brutel-Vuilmet et al. 2013; Perket et al. 2014; Thackeray and Fletcher 
2015; Mudryk et al. 2017). One reason for this is the large reflectivity 
(albedo) the snow exerts on shortwave radiative forcing: the all-
sky global land snow shortwave radiative effect is evaluated to be 
around –2.5 ± 0.5 W m–2 (Flanner et al. 2011; Singh et al. 2015). 
In the southern hemisphere, perennial snow on the Antarctic is the 
dominant contribution, while in the northern hemisphere, this is 
essentially attributable to seasonal snow, with a smaller contribution

from snow on glaciated areas. Another reason is the sensitivity of 
snow cover to temperature: Mudryk et al. (2017) recently showed 
that, in the high latitudes, climate models tend to correctly represent 
this sensitivity, while in mid-latitude and alpine regions, the simulated 
snow cover sensitivity to temperature variations tends to be biased 
low. In total, the global snow albedo feedback is about 0.1 W m–2 K–1, 
which amounts to about 7% of the strength of the globally dominant 
water vapour feedback (e.g., Thackeray and Fletcher (2015). While 
climate models do represent this feedback, a persistent spread in the 
modelled feedback strength has been noticed (Qu and Hall 2014) 
and, on average, the simulated snow albedo feedback strength tends 
to be somewhat weaker than in reality (medium confidence) (Flanner 
et al. 2011; Thackeray and Fletcher 2015). Various reasons for the 
spread and biases of the simulated snow albedo feedback have been 
identified, notably inadequate representations of vegetation masking 
snow in forested areas (Loranty et  al. 2014; Wang et  al. 2016c; 
Thackeray and Fletcher 2015).
The second most important potential feedback from land to climate 
relates to permafrost decay. There is high confidence that, following 
permafrost decay from a warming climate, the resulting emissions 
of CO2 and/or CH4 (caused by the decomposition of organic 
matter in previously frozen soil) will produce additional GHG-
induced warming. There is, however, substantial uncertainty on the 
magnitude of this feedback, although recent years have seen large 
progress in its quantification. Lack of agreement results from several 
critical factors that carry large uncertainties. The most important are 
(i) the size of the permafrost carbon pool, (ii) its decomposability, 
(iii) the magnitude, timing and pathway of future high-latitude 
climate change, and (iv) the correct identification and model 
representation of the processes at play (Schuur et al. 2015). The most 
recent comprehensive estimates establish a total soil organic carbon 
storage in permafrost of about 1500 ± 200 PgC (Hugelius et al. 2014, 
2013; Olefeldt et  al. 2016), which is about 300 Pg C lower than 
previous estimates (low confidence). Important progress has been 
made in recent years at incorporating permafrost-related processes 
in complex ESMs (e.g., McGuire et al. (2018)), but representations of 
some critical processes such as thermokarst formation are still in their 
infancy (Schuur et al. 2015). Recent model-based estimates of future 
permafrost carbon release (Koven et al. 2015; McGuire et al. 2018) 
have converged on an important insight. Their results suggest that 
substantial net carbon release of the coupled vegetation-permafrost 
system will probably not occur before about 2100 because carbon 
uptake by increased vegetation growth will initially compensate for 
GHG releases from permafrost (limited evidence, high agreement).
2.5.3.3 
Feedbacks related to changes in soil moisture 
resulting from global warming
There is medium evidence but high agreement that soil moisture 
conditions influence the frequency and magnitude of extremes 
such as drought and heatwaves. Observational evidence indicates 
that dry soil moisture conditions favour heatwaves, in particular 
in regions where evapotranspiration is limited by moisture 
availability (Mueller  and Seneviratne 2012; Quesada et  al. 2012; 
Miralles et al. 2018; Geirinhas et al. 2018; Miralles et al. 2014; Chiang 
et al. 2018; Dong and Crow 2019; Hirschi et al. 2014). 
In future climate projections, soil moisture plays an important role 
in the projected amplification of extreme heatwaves and drought in 
many regions of the world (medium confidence) (Seneviratne et al. 
2013; Vogel et al. 2017; Donat et al. 2018; Miralles et al. 2018). In 
addition, the areas where soil moisture affects heat extremes will 
not be located exactly where they are today. Changes in rainfall, 
temperature, and thus in evapotranspiration, will induce changes in 
soil moisture and therefore where temperature and latent heat flux 
will be negatively coupled (Seneviratne et al. 2006; Fischer et al. 2012). 
Quantitative estimates of the actual role of soil moisture feedbacks 
are, however, very uncertain due to the low confidence in projected soil 
moisture changes (IPCC 2013a), to weaknesses in the representation 
of soil moisture–atmosphere interactions in climate models (Sippel 
et al. 2017; Ukkola et al. 2018; Donat et al. 2018; Miralles et al. 2018) 
and to methodological uncertainties associated with the soil moisture 
prescription framework commonly used to disentangle the effect of 
soil moisture on changes in temperature extremes (Hauser et al. 2017). 
Where soil moisture is predicted to decrease in response to climate 
change in the subtropics and temperate latitudes, this drying could 
be enhanced by the existence of soil moisture feedbacks (low 
confidence) (Berg et al. 2016). The initial decrease in precipitation 
and increase in potential evapotranspiration and latent heat flux, in 
response to global climate change, leads to decreased soil moisture 
at those latitudes and can potentially amplify both. Such a feature 
is consistent with evidence that, in a warmer climate, land and 
atmosphere will be more strongly coupled via both the water and 
energy cycles (Dirmeyer et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2006). This increased 
sensitivity of atmospheric response to land perturbations implies that 
changes in land uses and cover are expected to have more impact on 
climate in the future than they do today.
Beyond temperature, it has been suggested that soil moisture 
feedbacks influence precipitation occurrence and intensity. But 
the importance, and even the sign of this feedback, is still largely 
uncertain and debated (Tuttle and Salvucci 2016; Yang et al. 2018; 
Froidevaux et al. 2014; Guillod et al. 2015).
2.5.4 
Non-local and downwind effects resulting 
from changes in land cover
Changes in land cover or land management do not just have local 
consequences but also affect adjacent or more remote areas. Those 
non-local impacts may occur in three different ways. 
1. Any action on land that affects photosynthesis and respiration has 
an impact on the atmospheric CO2 content as this GHG is well mixed 
in the atmosphere. In turn, this change affects the downwelling 
longwave radiation everywhere on the planet and contributes 
to global climate change. This is more thoroughly discussed in 
Section  2.6 where various land-based mitigation solutions are 
examined. Local land use changes thus have the potential to affect 
the global climate via changes in atmospheric CO2.
2. Any change in land cover or land management may impact on 
local surface air temperature and moisture, and thus sea-level 
pressure. Thermal, moisture and surface pressure gradients

between the area of change and neighbouring areas are then 
modifi ed and affect the amount of heat, water vapour and 
pollutants fl owing out (downwind) of the area (e.g., Ma et al. 
(2013b), McLeod et al. (2017), Abiodun et al. (2012), Keys (2012)). 
Forests, for example, provide water vapour to the atmosphere 
which supports terrestrial precipitation downwind (Ellison et al. 
2017; Layton and Ellison 2016; Spracklen et  al. 2012, 2018). 
Within a few days, water vapour can travel several hundred 
kilometres before being condensed into rain and potentially 
being transpired again (Makarieva et al. 2009). This cascading 
moisture recycling (succession of evapotranspiration, water 
vapour transport and condensation-rainfall) has been observed 
in South America (Spracklen et  al. 2018; Zemp et  al. 2014; 
Staal et al. 2018; Spracklen et al. 2012). Deforestation can thus 
potentially decrease rainfall downwind, while combining ‘small-
scale’ forestation and irrigation, which in the semi-arid region is 
susceptible to boost the precipitation-recycling mechanism with 
better vegetation growth downwind (Ellison et al. 2017; Layton 
and Ellison, 2016) (Figure 2.22).
3. Many studies using global climate models have reported that the 
climatic changes resulting from changes in land are not limited 
to the lower part of the atmosphere, but can reach the upper 
levels via changes in large-scale ascent (convection) or descent 
(subsidence) of air. This coupling to the upper atmosphere 
triggers perturbations in large-scale atmospheric transport (of 
heat, energy and water) and subsequent changes in temperature 
and rainfall in regions located quite far away from the original 
perturbation (Laguë and Swann 2016; Feddema et  al. 2005, 
Badger and Dirmeyer 2016; Garcia 2016; Stark 2015; Devaraju 
2018; Quesada et al. 2017a) (Figure 2.23). 
De Vrese et al. (2016) for example, using a global climate model, 
found that irrigation in India could affect regions as remote as eastern

Africa through changes in the atmospheric transport of water vapour. 
At the onset of boreal spring (February to March) evapotranspiration 
is already large over irrigated crops and the resulting excess moisture 
in the atmosphere is transported southwestward by low-level winds. 
This results in increases in precipitation as large as 1mm d–1 in the 
Horn of Africa. Such a finding implies that, if irrigation is to decrease in 
India, rainfall can decrease in eastern Africa where the consequences 
of drought are already disastrous. 
Changes in sea-surface temperature have also been simulated in 
response to large-scale vegetation changes (Cowling et al. 2009; Davin 
and de Noblet-Ducoudre 2010; Wang et al. 2014b, Notaro Liu 2007). 
Most of those modelling studies have been carried out with land 
cover changes that are extremely large and often exaggerated with 
respect to reality. The existence of such teleconnections can thus be 
biased, as discussed in Lorenz et al. (2016). 
In conclusion, there is high confidence that any action on land (for 
example, to dampen global warming effects), wherever they occur, will 
not only have effects on local climate but also generate atmospheric 
changes in neighbouring regions, and potentially as far as hundreds 
of kilometres downwind. More remote teleconnections, thousands 
of kilometres away from the initial perturbation, are impossible to 
observe and have only been reported by modelling studies using 
extreme land cover changes. There is very low confidence that 
detectable changes due to such long-range processes can occur.

Cities extent, population, and expected growth
Despite only covering 0.4–0.9% of the global land surface (Esch et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2015), over half the world’s population 
live in towns and cities (United Nations, 2017) generating around three-quarters of the global total carbon emissions from energy 
use (Creutzig et al. 2015b; Seto et al. 2014). Urban food consumption is a large source of these anthropogenic GHG emissions 
(Goldstein et al. 2017). In developed countries, per capita emissions are larger in small cities than bigger ones, while the opposite 
is found in developing countries (Gudipudi et al. 2019). Climate change is expected to increase the energy demand of people living 
in urban areas (Santamouris et al. 2015; Wenz et al. 2017).
In addition to being a driver of emissions, urbanisation contributes to forest degradation, converts neighbouring agricultural, 
forested or otherwise undeveloped land to urban use, altering natural or semi-natural ecosystems both within and outside of urban 
areas (Du and Huang 2017). It has been identified as a major driver of land degradation, as illustrated in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. Highly 
productive lands are experiencing the highest rate of conversion to urbanised landscapes (Nizeyimana et al. 2001; Pandey et al. 2018), 
affecting food security. Loss of agricultural land and increased pollution and waste are some of key challenges arising from urbanisation 
and urban growth (Chen 2007). The proportion of urban population is predicted to reach about 70% by the middle of the century 
(United Nations 2017) with growth especially taking place in the developing world (Angel et al. 2011; Dahiya 2012). Urban sprawl 
is projected to consume 1.8–2.4% and 5% of the current cultivated land by 2030 and 2050, respectively (Pradhan et al. 2014; Bren 
d’Amour et al. 2016), driven by both general population increase and immigration from rural areas (Adger et al. 2015; Seto et al. 2011; 
Geddes et al. 2012). New city dwellers in developing countries will require land for housing to be converted from non-urban to urban 
land (Barbero-Sierra et al. 2013), indicating future degradation. These growing urban areas will experience direct and indirect climate 
change impacts, such as sea level rise and storm surges (Boettle et al. 2016; Revi et al. 2014), increasing soil salinity and landslides from 
precipitation extremes. Furthermore, poorly planned urbanisation can increase people’s risk to climate hazards as informal settlements 
and poorly built infrastructure are often the most exposed to hazards from fire, flooding and landslides (Adger et al. 2015; Geddes et al. 
2012; Revi et al. 2014). Currently, avoiding land degradation and maintaining/enhancing ecosystem services are rarely considered in 
planning processes (Kuang et al. 2017). 
Climate change, urban heat island and threats specific to urban populations
Cities alter the local atmospheric conditions as well as those of the surrounding areas (Wang et al. 2016b; Zhong et al. 2017). 
There is high confidence that urbanisation increases mean annual surface air temperature in cities and in their surroundings, with 
increases ranging from 0.19–2.60°C (Torres-Valcárcel et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018a; Doan et al. 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box 4; Figure 1). 
This phenomenon is referred to as the urban heat island (UHI) effect (Oke et al. 2017; Bader et al. 2018). The magnitude and diurnal 
amplitude of the UHI varies from one city to another and depends on the local background climate (Wienert and Kuttler 2005; 
Zhao et al. 2014; Ward et al. 2016). There is nevertheless high confidence that urbanisation affects night-time temperatures more 
substantially than daytime ones (Argüeso et al. 2014; Alghamdi and Moore 2015; Alizadeh-Choobari et al. 2016; Fujibe, 2009; 
Hausfather et al. 2013; Liao et al. 2017; Sachindra et al. 2016; Camilloni and Barrucand 2012; Wang et al. 2017a; Hamdi, 2010;

Cross-Chapter Box 4 (continued)
Arsiso et al. 2018; Elagib 2011; Lokoshchenko 2017; Robaa 2013). In addition, there is high confidence that the UHI effect makes 
heatwaves more intense in cities by 1.22–4°C, particularly at night (Li and Bou-Zeid 2013; Li et al. 2017b; Hamdi et al. 2016; Founda 
and Santamouris 2017; Wang et al. 2017a). As there is a well-established relationship between extremely high temperatures and 
morbidity, mortality (Watts et al. 2015) and labour productivity (Costa et al. 2016), an expected increase in extreme heat events 
with future climate change will worsen the conditions in cities.
Cross-Chapter Box 4, Figure 1 |  Change in annual mean surface air temperature resulting from urbanisation (°C). The colour and size of the circles 
refer to the magnitude of the change. (This map has been compiled using the following studies: Kim et al. (2016), Sun et al. (2016), Chen et al. (2016a), Founda 
et al. (2015), Rafael et al. (2017), Hinkel and Nelson (2007), Chrysanthou et al. (2014), Dou et al. (2014), Zhou et al. (2016), (2017), Polydoros et al. (2018), Li et al.

Liao et al. (2017)).
Individual city case studies show that precipitation mean and extremes are increased over and downwind of urban areas, especially 
in the afternoon and early evening when convective rise of the atmosphere is the strongest (medium confidence). The case studies 
covered: different inland and coastal US cities (Haberlie et al. 2014; McLeod et al. 2017; Ganeshan and Murtugudde 2015), Dutch 
coastal cities (Daniels et al. 2016), Hamburg (Schlünzen et al. 2010), Shanghai (Liang and Ding 2017), Beijing (Dou et al. 2014), and 
Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur (Lorenz et al. 2016). Increased aerosol concentrations, however, can interrupt the precipitation formation 
process and thereby reduce heavy rainfall (Daniels et al. 2016; Zhong et al. 2017). Urban areas also experience altered water cycle 
in other aspects: the evaporative demand for plants in cities are increased by as much as 10% (Zipper et al. 2017), while the high 
proportion of paving in cities means that surface runoff of water is high (Hamdi et al. 2011; Pataki et al. 2011). In addition, water 
retention is lower in degraded, sealed soils beneath urban surfaces compared to intact soils. Increased surface water runoff, especially 
when and where the rainfall intensity is likely to intensify (IPCC 2013a), leads to a greater likelihood of flooding in urban areas without 
implementation of adaptation measures (Shade and Kremer 2019; Wang et al. 2013; EPA 2015).
Urbanisation alters the stock size of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its stability. The conversion of vegetated land to urban land 
results in a loss of carbon stored in plants, while stresses associated with the urban environment (e.g., heat, limited water availability, 
pollution) reduce plant growth and survival in cities (Xu et al. 2016b). Overall, carbon densities or stocks decrease from natural land 
areas to the urban core along the rural-urban gradient (Tao et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015). For example, the Seoul Forest Park, an 
urban park, shows a tenfold difference in SOC stocks across its land cover types (Bae and Ryu 2015). In Changchun in Northeast 
China, however, SOC density is higher in recreational forests within urban areas compared to a production forest (Zhang et al. 2015). 
Urban air pollution as an environmental risk increases with climate change. Increased air temperatures can lead to reduced air 
quality by enhancing the formation of photochemical oxidants and increasing the concentration of air pollutants such as ozone, with 
corresponding threats to human health (Sharma et al. 2013). The occurrence of bronchial asthma and allergic respiratory diseases 
is  increasing worldwide, and urban residents are experiencing poor air quality conditions more frequently than rural residents

Climate consequences 
of response options
Response options can affect climate mitigation and adaptation 
simultaneously, therefore this Special Report on Climate Change 
and Land (SRCCL) discusses land-based response options in an 
integrated way (Chapter 1). In this chapter, we assess response 
options that that have an effect on climate. A description of the 
full set of response options across the SRCCL can be found in 
Chapter 6, including the interplay between mitigation, adaptation, 
desertification, land degradation, food security and other co-
benefits and trade-offs. Response options specific to desertification, 
degradation and food security are described in more detail in 
Chapters 3, 4 and 5. 
Some response options lead to land use change and can compete 
with other land uses, including other response options, while others 
may free-up land that can be used for further mitigation/adaptation 
by reducing demand for land or products (e.g., agricultural 
intensification, diet shifts and reduction of waste) (high confidence). 
Some response options result in a net removal of GHGs from the 
atmosphere and storage in living or dead organic material, or in 
geological stores (IPCC SR15). Such options are frequently referred 
to in the literature as CO2 removal (CDR), greenhouse gas removal 
(GGR) or negative emissions technologies (NETs). CDR options are 
assessed alongside emissions reduction options. Although they have 
a land footprint, solar and wind farms are not are not assessed here 
as they affect GHG flux in the energy industrial sectors with minimal 
effect in the land sector, but the impact of solar farms on agricultural 
land competition is dealt with in Chapter 7.
Cross-Chapter Box 4 (continued)
(D’Amato et al. 2010). Excess morbidity and mortality related to extremely poor air quality are found in many cities worldwide (Harlan 
and Ruddell 2011). Some emissions that lead to reduced air quality are also contributors to climate change (Shindell et al. 2018; 
de Coninck et al. 2018).
Urban response options for climate change, desertification, land degradation and food security 
Urban green infrastructure (UGI) has been proposed as a solution to mitigate climate change directly through carbon sequestration 
(Davies et al. 2011; Edmondson et al. 2014). However, compared to overall carbon emissions from cities, its mitigation effects are 
likely to be small (medium confidence). UGI nevertheless has an important role in adapting cities to climate change (Demuzere et al. 
2014; Sussams et al. 2015; Elmqvist et al. 2016; Gill et al. 2007; Revi et al. 2014). Adaptation through UGIs is achieved through, for 
example, (i) reduction in air temperature (Cavan et al. 2014; Di Leo et al. 2016; Feyisa et al. 2014; Zölch et al. 2016; Li et al. 2019) 
which can help improve human health and comfort (e.g., Brown and Nicholls 2015; Klemm et al. 2015), (ii) reduction in the energy 
demands of buildings through the use of green roofs and walls (e.g., Coma et al. 2017), and (iii) reduction in surface water runoff 
and flood risk (Zeleňáková et al. 2017). Given that UGI necessarily involves the retention and management of non-sealed surfaces, 
co-benefits for land degradation will also be apparent (limited evidence, high agreement) (Murata and Kawai 2018; Scalenghe 
and Marsan 2009).
Urban agriculture is one aspect of UGI that has the potential to both meet some of the food needs of cities and reduce land degradation 
pressures in rural areas (low confidence) (e.g., Wilhelm and Smith (2018)). Urban agriculture has many forms, such as backyard 
gardening, allotments, plants on rooftops or balconies, urban-fringe/peri-urban agriculture, hydroponics, aquaponics, livestock grazing 
in open spaces and vertical farming (Gerster-Bentaya 2013) (Section 5.6.5). 
Consuming locally produced food and enhancing the efficiency of food processing and transportation can minimise food losses, 
contribute to food security and, in some circumstances, reduce GHG emissions (Brodt et al. 2013; Michalský and Hooda 2015; Tobarra 
et al. 2018) (Section 5.5.2.3). Furthermore, urban agriculture has the potential to counteract the separation of urban populations 
from food production. This separation is one driver of the transition towards more homogeneous, high-protein diets, which are 
associated with increased GHG emissions (Goldstein et al. 2017; Moragues-Faus and Marceau 2018; Magarini and Calori 2015). Barriers 
to the uptake of urban agriculture as a climate change mitigation option include the need for efficient distribution systems to ensure 
lowered carbon emissions (Newman et al. 2012) and the concern that urban agriculture may harbour pathogenic diseases, or that its 
products be contaminated by soil or air pollution (Hamilton et al. 2014; Ercilla-Montserrat et al. 2018).
In summary 
Climate change is already affecting the health and energy demand of large numbers of people living in urban areas (high confidence) 
(Section 2.2). Future changes to both climate and urbanisation will enhance warming in cities and their surroundings, especially 
during heatwaves (high confidence). Urban and peri-urban agriculture and, more generally, the implementation of urban green 
infrastructure, can contribute to climate change mitigation (medium confidence) as well as to adaptation (high confidence), 
including co-benefits for food security and reduced soil-water-air pollution.

Land–climate interactions  
Chapter 2
2
A number of different types of scenario approach exist for estimating 
climate contribution of land-based response options (Cross-Chapter 
Box 1 and Chapter 1). Mitigation potentials have been estimated 
for single and sometimes multiple response options using stylised 
‘bottom-up’ scenarios. Response options are not mutually exclusive 
(e.g., management of soil carbon and cropland management). 
Different options interact with each other; they may have additive 
effects or compete with each other for land or other resources and 
thus these potentials cannot necessarily be added up. The interplay 
between different land-based mitigation options, as well as with 
mitigation options in other sectors (such as energy or transport), 
in contributing to specific mitigation pathways has been assessed 
using IAMs (Section 2.7.2). These include interactions with wider 
socioeconomic conditions (Cross-Chapter Box 1 and Chapter 1) and 
other sustainability goals (Chapter 6).
2.6.1 
Climate impacts of individual response options
Since AR5, there have been many new estimates of the climate impacts 
of single or multiple response options, summarised in Figure 2.24 
and discussed in sub-sections below. Recently published syntheses 
of mitigation potential of land-based response options (e.g., Hawken 
(2017a), Smith et al. (2016b), Griscom et al. (2017), Minx et al. (2018), 
Fuss et al. (2018b), Nemet et al. (2018)) are also included in Figure 
2.24. The wide range in mitigation estimates reflects differences in 
methodologies that may not be directly comparable, and estimates 
cannot be necessarily be added if they were calculated independently 
as they may be competing for land and other resources. 
Some studies assess a ‘technical mitigation potential’ – the amount 
possible with current technologies. Some include resource constraints 
(e.g., limits to yields, limits to natural forest conversion) to assess 
a ‘sustainable potential’. Some assess an ‘economic potential’ 
mitigation at different carbon prices. Few include social and political 
constraints (e.g., behaviour change, enabling conditions) (Chapter 7), 
the biophysical climate effects (Section 2.5) or the impacts of future 
climate change (Section 2.3). Carbon stored in biomass and soils may 
be at risk of future climate change (Section 2.2), natural disturbances 
such as wildfire (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter) and future 
changes in land use or management changes that result in a net loss 
of carbon (Gren and Aklilu 2016). 
2.6.1.1 
Land management in agriculture 
Reducing non-CO2 emissions from agriculture through cropland 
nutrient management, enteric fermentation, manure management, 
rice cultivation and fertiliser production has a total mitigation 
potential of 0.30–3.38 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (medium confidence) 
(combined sub-category measures in Figure 2.24, details below) with 
a further 0.25–6.78  GtCO2-eq yr–1 from soil carbon management 
(Section  2.6.1.3). Other literature that looks at broader categories 
finds mitigation potential of 1.4–2.3 GtCO2-eq yr–1 from improved 
cropland management (Smith et al. 2008, 2014; Pradhan et al., 2013); 
1.4–1.8  GtCO2-eq yr–1 from improved grazing land management 
(Conant et  al. 2017; Herrero et  al. 2016; Smith et  al. 2008, 2014) 
and 0.2–2.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 from improved livestock management 
(Smith et al. 2008, 2014; Herrero et al. 2016, FAO 2007). Detailed 
discussions of the mitigation potential of agricultural response 
options and their co-benefits are provided in Chapter 5 and Sections 
5.5 and 5.6.
The three main measures to reduce enteric fermentation include 
improved animal diets (higher quality, more digestible livestock 
feed), supplements and additives (reduce methane by changing the 
microbiology of the rumen), and animal management and breeding 
(improve husbandry practices and genetics). Applying these measures 
can mitigate 0.12–1.18 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (medium confidence) (Hristov 
et al. 2013; Dickie et al. 2014; Herrero et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 
2017). However, these measures may have limitations such as need 
of crop-based feed (Pradhan et al. 2013) and associated ecological 
costs, toxicity and animal welfare issues related to food additives 
(Llonch et al. 2017). Measures to manage manure include anaerobic 
digestion for energy use, composting as a nutrient source, reducing 
storage time and changing livestock diets, and have a potential of 
0.01–0.26 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (Herrero et al. 2016; Dickie et al. 2014). 
On croplands, there is a mitigation potential of 0.03–0.71 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
for cropland nutrient management (fertiliser application) (medium 
confidence) (Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017; Paustian et al. 2016; 
Dickie et al. 2014; Beach et al. 2015). Reducing emissions from rice 
production through improved water management (periodic draining 
of flooded fields to reduce methane emissions from anaerobic 
decomposition) and straw residue management (applying in dry 
conditions instead of on flooded fields and avoiding burning to 
reduce methane and N2O emissions) has the potential to mitigate up 
to 60% of emissions (Hussain et al. 2015), or 0.08–0.87 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(medium confidence) (Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017; Paustian 
et  al. 2016; Hussain et  al. 2015; Dickie et  al. 2014; Beach et  al. 
2015). Furthermore, sustainable intensification through the 
integration of crop and livestock systems can increase productivity, 
decrease emission intensity and act as a climate adaptation option 
(Section 5.5.1.4). 
Agroforestry is a land management system that combines woody 
biomass (e.g., trees or shrubs) with crops and/or livestock). 
The mitigation potential from agroforestry ranges between 
0.08–5.7 GtCO2 yr–1, (medium confidence) (Griscom et al. 2017; Dickie 
et al. 2014; Zomer et al. 2016; Hawken 2017). The high estimate is from 
an optimum scenario combing four agroforestry solutions (silvopasture, 
tree intercropping, multistrata agroforestry and tropical staple trees) 
of Hawken (2017a). Zomer et  al. (2016) reported that the trees in 
agroforestry landscapes had increased carbon stock by 7.33 GtCO2 
between 2000 and 2010, or 0.7 GtCO2 yr–1 (Section 5.5.1.3).
2.6.1.2 
Land management in forests 
The mitigation potential for reducing and/or halting deforestation 
and degradation ranges from 0.4–5.8 GtCO2 yr–1 (high confidence) 
(Griscom et  al. 2017; Hawken 2017; Busch and Engelmann 2017; 
Baccini et  al. 2017; Zarin et  al. 2016; Federici et  al. 2015; Carter 
et al. 2015; Houghton et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2013a; Houghton and 
Nassikas 2018). The higher figure represents a complete halting of 
land use conversion in forests and peatlands (i.e., assuming recent

F igure 2.24 |  Mitigation potential of response options in 2020–2050, measured in GtCO2-eq yr–1, adapted from Roe et al. (2017). Mitigation potentials refl ect 
the full range of low to high estimates from studies published after 2010, differentiated according to technical (possible with current technologies), economic (possible given 
economic constraints) and sustainable potential (technical or economic potential constrained by sustainability considerations). Medians are calculated across all potentials in 
categories with more than four data points. We only include references that explicitly provide mitigation potential estimates in CO2-eq yr–1 (or a similar derivative) by 2050. 
Not all options for land management potentials are additive, as some may compete for land. Estimates refl ect a range of methodologies (including defi nitions, global warming 
potentials and time horizons) that may not be directly comparable or additive. Results from IAMs are shown to compare with single option ‘bottom-up’ estimates, in available 
categories from the 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios in the SSP Database (version 2.0). The models refl ect land management changes, yet in some instances, can also refl ect demand-
side effects from carbon prices, so may not be defi ned exclusively as ‘supply-side’. References: 1) Griscom et al. (2017), 2) Hawken (2017), 3) Paustian et al. (2016), 4) Beach

rates of carbon loss are saved each year). Separate estimates 
of degradation only range from 1.0–2.18 GtCO2 yr–1. Reduced 
deforestation and forest degradation include conservation of existing 
carbon pools in vegetation and soil through protection in reserves, 
controlling disturbances such as fire and pest outbreaks, and 
changing management practices. Differences in estimates stem from 
varying land cover definitions, the time periods assessed and the 
carbon pools included (most higher estimates include belowground, 
dead wood, litter, soil and peat carbon). When deforestation and 
degradation are halted, it may take many decades to fully recover 
the biomass initially present in native ecosystems (Meli et al. 2017) 
(Section 4.8.3).
Afforestation/reforestation (A/R) and forest restoration can increase 
carbon sequestration in both vegetation and soils by 0.5–10.1 
GtCO2  yr–1 (medium confidence) (Fuss et  al. 2018; Griscom et  al. 
2017; Hawken 2017; Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Li et al. 2016; Huang 
et al. 2017; Sonntag et al. 2016; Lenton 2014; McLaren 2012; Lenton 
2010; Erb et  al. 2018; Dooley and Kartha 2018; Yan et  al. 2017; 
Houghton et al. 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2018). Afforestation 
is the conversion to forest of land that historically has not contained 
forests. Reforestation is the conversion to forest of land that has 
previously contained forests but that has been converted to some 
other use. Forest restoration refers to practices aimed at regaining 
ecological integrity in a deforested or degraded forest landscape. The 
lower estimate represents the lowest range from an ESM (Yan et al. 
2017) and of sustainable global negative emissions potential (Fuss 
et  al. 2018), and the higher estimate reforests all areas where 
forests are the native cover type, constrained by food security and 
biodiversity considerations (Griscom et al. 2017). It takes time for 
full carbon removal to be achieved as the forest grows. Removal 
occurs at faster rates in young- to medium-aged forests and declines 
thereafter such that older forest stands have smaller carbon removals 
but larger stocks, with net uptake of carbon slowing as forests reach 
maturity (Yao et al. 2018; Poorter et al. 2016; Tang et al. 2014). The 
land intensity of afforestation and reforestation has been estimated 
at 0.0029 km2 tC–1 yr–1 (Smith et al. 2016a). Boysen et al. (2017) 
estimated that to sequester about 100 GtC by 2100 would require 
13 Mkm2 of abandoned cropland and pastures (Section 4.8.3). 
Forest management has the potential to mitigate 0.4–2.1 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
(medium confidence) (Sasaki et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017; Sasaki 
et  al. 2012). Forest management can alter productivity, turnover 
rates, harvest rates carbon in soil and carbon in wood products (Erb 
et al. 2017; Campioli et al. 2015; Birdsey and Pan 2015; Erb et al. 
2016; Noormets et al. 2015; Wäldchen et al. 2013; Malhi et al. 2015; 
Quesada et al. 2018; Nabuurs et al. 2017; Bosello et al. 2009) (Section 
4.8.4). Fertilisation may enhance productivity but would increase 
N2O emissions. Preserving and enhancing carbon stocks in forests 
has immediate climate benefits but the sink can saturate and is 
vulnerable to future climate change (Seidl et al. 2017). Wood can be 
harvested and used for bioenergy substituting for fossil fuels (with 
or without carbon capture and storage) (Section 2.6.1.5), for long-
lived products such as timber (see below), to be buried as biochar 
(Section 2.6.1.1) or for use in the wider bioeconomy, enabling areas 
of land to be used continuously for mitigation. This leads to initial 
carbon loss and lower carbon stocks but with each harvest cycle, the 
carbon loss (debt) can be paid back and after a parity time, result in 
net savings (Laganière et al. 2017; Bernier and Paré 2013; Mitchell 
et al. 2012; Haberl et al. 2012; Haberl 2013; Ter-Mikaelian et al. 2015; 
Macintosh et  al. 2015). The trade-off between maximising forest 
carbon stocks and maximising substitution is highly dependent on 
the counterfactual assumption (no-use vs extrapolation of current 
management), initial forest conditions and site-specific contexts 
(such as regrowth rates and the displacement factors and efficiency 
of substitution), and relative differences in emissions released 
during extraction, transport and processing of the biomass- or fossil-
based resources, as well as assumptions about emission associated 
with the product or energy source that is substituted (Grassi et al. 
2018b; Nabuurs et al. 2017; Pingoud et al. 2018; Smyth et al. 2017a; 
Luyssaert et al. 2018; Valade et al. 2017; York 2012; Ter-Mikaelian 
et al. 2014; Naudts et al. 2016b; Mitchell et al. 2012; Haberl et al. 
2012; Macintosh et al. 2015; Laganière et al. 2017; Haberl 2013). This 
leads to uncertainty about optimum mitigation strategies in managed 
forests, while high carbon ecosystems such as primary forests would 
have large initial carbon losses and long pay-back times, and thus 
protection of stocks would be more optimal (Lemprière et al. 2013; 
Kurz et al. 2016; Keith et al. 2014) (Section 4.8.4).
Global mitigation potential from increasing the demand of 
wood products to replace construction materials range from 
0.25–1 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (medium confidence) (McLaren 2012; Miner 
2010), the uncertainty is determined in part by consideration of 
the factors described above, and is sensitive to the displacement 
factor, or the substitution benefit in CO2, when wood is used 
instead of another material, which may vary in the future as other 
sectors reduce emissions (and may also vary due to market factors) 
(Sathre and O’Connor 2010; Nabuurs et al. 2018; Iordan et al. 2018; 
Braun  et  al. 2016; Gustavsson et  al. 2017; Peñaloza et al. 2018; 
Soimakallio et al. 2016; Grassi et al. 2018b). Using harvested carbon 
in long-lived products (e.g., for construction) can represent a store 
that can sometimes be from decades to over a century, while the 
wood can also substitute for intensive building materials, avoiding 
emissions from the production of concrete and steel (Sathre and 
O’Connor 2010; Smyth et al. 2017b; Nabuurs et al. 2007; Lemprière 
et al. 2013). The harvest of carbon and storage in products affects the 
net carbon balance of the forest sector, with the aim of sustainable 
forest management strategies being to optimise carbon stocks and 
use harvested products to generate sustained mitigation benefits 
(Nabuurs et al. 2007). 
Biophysical effects of forest response options are variable depending 
on the location and scale of activity (Section 2.6). Reduced 
deforestation or afforestation in the tropics contributes to climate 
mitigation through both biogeochemical and biophysical effects. 
It also maintains rainfall recycling to some extent. In contrast, in 
higher latitude boreal areas, observational and modelling studies 
show that afforestation and reforestation lead to local and global 
warming effects, particularly in snow covered regions in the winter 
as the albedo is lower for forests than bare snow (Bathiany et al. 
2010; Dass et  al. 2013; Devaraju et  al. 2018; Ganopolski et  al. 
2001; Snyder et al. 2004; West et al. 2011; Arora and Montenegro 
2011) (Section 2.6). Management, for example, thinning practices 
in forestry, could increase the albedo in regions where albedo

decreases with age. The length of rotation cycles in forestry affects 
tree height and thus roughness, and through the removal of leaf 
mass harvest reduces evapotranspiration (Erb et  al. 2017), which 
could lead to increased fire susceptibility in the tropics. In temperate 
and boreal sites, biophysical forest management effects on surface 
temperature were shown to be of similar magnitude than changes 
in land cover (Luyssaert et al. 2014). These biophysical effects could 
be of a magnitude to overcompensate biogeochemical effects, for 
example, the sink strength of regrowing forests after past depletions 
(Luyssaert et al. 2018; Naudts et al. 2016b), but many parameters and 
assumptions on counterfactual influence the account (Anderson et al. 
2011; Li et al. 2015b; Bright et al. 2015).
Forest cover also affects climate through reactive gases and aerosols, 
with limited evidence and medium agreement that the decrease 
in the emissions of BVOC resulting from the historical conversion 
of forests to cropland has resulted in a positive radiative forcing 
through direct and indirect aerosol effects. A negative radiative 
forcing through reduction in the atmospheric lifetime of CH4 has 
increased and decreased ozone concentrations in different regions 
(Section 2.4). 
2.6.1.3 
Land management of soils
The global mitigation potential for increasing soil organic 
matter stocks in mineral soils is estimated to be in the range of 
0.4–8.64 GtCO2 yr–1 (high confidence), though the full literature 
range is wider with high uncertainty related to some practices (Fuss 
et  al. 2018; Sommer and Bossio 2014; Lal 2010; Lal et  al. 2004; 
Conant et al. 2017; Dickie et al. 2014; Frank et al. 2017a; Griscom 
et al. 2017; Herrero et al. 2015, 2016; McLaren 2012; Paustian et al. 
2016; Poeplau and Don 2015; Powlson et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016c; 
Zomer et al. 2017). Some studies have separate potentials for soil 
carbon sequestration in croplands (0.25–6.78 GtCO2 yr–1) (Griscom 
et al. 2017; Hawken 2017; Frank et al. 2017a; Paustian et al. 2016; 
Herrero et al. 2016; Henderson et al. 2015; Dickie et al. 2014; Conant 
et al. 2017; Lal 2010) and soil carbon sequestration in grazing lands 
(0.13–2.56 GtCO2 yr–1) (Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017; Frank 
et al. 2017a; Paustian et al. 2016; Powlson et al. 2014; McLaren 2012; 
Zomer et al. 2017; Smith et al. 2015; Sommer and Bossio 2014; Lal 
2010). The potential for soil carbon sequestration and storage varies 
considerably depending on prior and current land management 
approaches, soil type, resource availability, environmental conditions, 
microbial composition and nutrient availability among other factors 
(Hassink and Whitmore 1997; Smith and Dukes 2013; Palm et  al. 
2014; Lal 2013; Six et al. 2002; Feng et al. 2013). Soils are a finite 
carbon sink and sequestration rates may decline to negligible levels 
over as little as a couple of decades as soils reach carbon saturation 
(West et  al. 2004; Smith and Dukes 2013). The sink is at risk of 
reversibility, in particular due to increased soil respiration under 
higher temperatures (Section 2.3).
Land management practices to increase carbon interact with 
agricultural and fire management practices (Cross-chapter Box 3 
and Chapter 5) and include improved rotations with deeper rooting 
cultivars, addition of organic materials and agroforestry (Lal 2011; 
Smith et al. 2008; Lorenz and Pitman 2014; Lal 2013; Vermeulen et al. 
2012; de Rouw et al. 2010). Adoption of green manure cover crops, 
while increasing cropping frequency or diversity, helps sequester SOC 
(Poeplau and Don 2015; Mazzoncini et al. 2011; Luo et al. 2010). 
Studies of the long-term SOC sequestration potential of conservation 
agriculture (i.e., the simultaneous adoption of minimum tillage, 
(cover) crop residue retention and associated soil surface coverage, 
and crop rotations) include results that are both positive (Powlson 
et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2014) and inconclusive (Cheesman et al. 
2016; Palm et al. 2014; Govaerts et al. 2009). 
The efficacy of reduced and zero-till practices is highly context-specific; 
many studies demonstrate increased carbon storage (e.g., Paustian 
et al. (2000), Six et al. (2004), van Kessel et al. (2013)), while others 
show the opposite effect (Sisti et al. 2004; Álvaro-Fuentes et al. 2008; 
Christopher et  al. 2009). On the other hand, deep ploughing can 
contribute to SOC sequestration by burying soil organic matter in the 
subsoil where it decomposes slowly (Alcántara et al. 2016). Meta-
analyses (Haddaway et al. 2017; Luo et al. 2010; Meurer et al. 2018) 
also show a mix of positive and negative responses, and the lack of 
robust comparisons of soils on an equivalent mass basis continues 
to be a problem for credible estimates (Wendt and Hauser 2013; 
Powlson et al. 2011; Powlson et al. 2014). 
Soil carbon management interacts with N2O (Paustian et  al. 
2016). For example, Li et al. (2005) estimate that the management 
strategies required to increase carbon sequestration (reduced tillage, 
crop residue and manure recycling) would increase N2O emissions 
significantly, offsetting 75–310% of the carbon sequestered in terms 
of CO2 equivalence, while other practices such as cover crops can 
reduce N2O emissions (Kaye and Quemada 2017).
The management of soil erosion could avoid a net emissions of 
1.36–3.67 GtCO2  yr–1 and create a sink of 0.44–3.67 GtCO2  yr–1 
(low confidence) (Jacinthe and Lal 2001; Lal et  al. 2004; Stallard 
1998; Smith et al. 2001; Van Oost et al. 2007). The overall impact 
of erosion control on mitigation is context-specific and uncertain at 
the global level and the final fate of eroded material is still debated 
(Hoffmann et al., 2013). 
Biochar is produced by thermal decomposition of biomass in the 
absence of oxygen (pyrolysis) into a stable, long-lived product like 
charcoal that is relatively resistant to decomposition (Lehmann et al. 
2015) and which can stabilise organic matter when added to soil 
(Weng et al. 2017). Although charcoal has been used traditionally 
by many cultures as a soil amendment, ‘modern biochar’, produced 
in facilities that control emissions, is not widely used. The range 
of global potential of biochar is 0.03–6.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1 by 2050, 
including energy substitution,  with  0.03–4.9  GtCO2  yr–1  for CDR 
only (medium confidence) (Griscom et  al. 2017; Hawken 2017; 
Paustian et al. 2016; Fuss et al. 2018; Lenton 2014, 2010; Powell and 
Lenton 2012; Woolf et al. 2010; Pratt and Moran 2010; Smith 2016; 
Roberts et al. 2010). An analysis in which biomass supply constraints 
were applied to protect against food insecurity, loss of habitat 
and land degradation, estimated  technical potential  abatement 
of 3.7–6.6 GtCO2-eq yr–1  (including 2.6–4.6 GtCO2 yr–1  carbon 
stabilisation) (Woolf et al. 2010). Fuss et al. (2018) propose a range 
of 0.5–2 GtCO2-eq yr–1 as the  sustainable  potential  for negative

emissions through biochar. Griscom et al. (2017) suggest a potential 
of 1.0 GtCO2 yr–1 based on available residues. Biochar can provide 
additional climate change mitigation benefits by decreasing N2O 
emissions from soil and reducing nitrogen fertiliser requirements 
in agricultural soils (Borchard et  al. 2019). Application of biochar 
to cultivated soils can darken the surface and reduce its mitigation 
potential via decreases in surface albedo, but the magnitude of this 
effect depends on soil moisture content, biochar application method 
and type of land use (low confidence) (Verheijen et al. 2013; Bozzi 
et al. 2015) (Section 4.9.5). 
2.6.1.4 
Land management in other ecosystems 
Protection and restoration of wetlands, peatlands and coastal 
habitats reduces net carbon loss (primarily from sediment/soils) and 
provides continued or enhanced natural CO2 removal (Section 4.9.4). 
Reducing annual emissions from peatland conversion, draining and 
burning could mitigate 0.45–1.22 GtCO2-eq yr–1 up to 2050 (medium 
confidence) (Hooijer et al. 2010; Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017) 
and peatland restoration 0.15–0.81 ( low confidence) (Couwenberg 
et al. 2010; Griscom et al. 2017). The upper end from Griscom et al. 
(2017) represents a maximum sustainable potential (accounting for 
biodiversity and food security safeguards) for rewetting and biomass 
enhancement. Wetland drainage and rewetting was included as 
a flux category under the second commitment period of the Kyoto 
Protocol, with significant management knowledge gained over the 
last decade (IPCC 2013b). However, there are high uncertainties as to 
carbon storage and flux rates, in particular the balance between CH4 
sources and CO2 sinks (Spencer et al. 2016). Peatlands are sensitive 
to climate change which may increase carbon uptake by vegetation 
and carbon emissions due to respiration, with the balance being 
regionally dependent (high confidence). There is low confidence 
about the future peatland sink globally. Some peatlands have been 
found to be resilient to climate change (Minayeva and Sirin 2012), 
but the combination of land use change and climate change may 
make them vulnerable to fire (Sirin et al. 2011). While models show 
mixed results for the future sink (Spahni et al. 2013; Chaudhary et al. 
2017; Ise et al. 2008), a study that used extensive historical data 
sets to project change under future warming scenarios found that the 
current global peatland sink could increase slightly until 2100 and 
decline thereafter (Gallego-Sala et al. 2018). 
Reducing the conversion of coastal wetlands (mangroves, seagrass 
and marshes) could reduce emissions by 0.11–2.25 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
by 2050 (medium confidence) (Pendleton et al. 2012; Griscom et al. 
2017; Howard et al. 2017; Hawken 2017). Mangrove restoration can 
mitigate the release of 0.07 GtCO2 yr–1 through rewetting (Crooks 
et al. 2011) and take up 0.02–0.84 GtCO2 yr–1 from biomass and 
soil enhancement (medium confidence) (Griscom et al. 2017). The 
ongoing benefits provided by mangroves as a natural carbon sink 
can be nationally-important for small island developing states (SIDS) 
and other countries with extensive coastlines, based on estimates 
of high carbon sequestration rates per unit area (McLeod et  al. 
2011; Duarte et al. 2013; Duarte 2017; Taillardat et al. 2018). There 
is only medium confidence in the effectiveness of enhanced carbon 
uptake using mangroves, due to the many uncertainties regarding 
the response of mangroves to future climate change (Jennerjahn 
et al. 2017), dynamic changes in distributions (Kelleway et al. 2017) 
and other local-scale factors affecting long-term sequestration and 
climatic benefits (e.g.,  methane release) (Dutta et  al. 2017). The 
climate mitigation potential of coastal vegetated habitats (mangrove 
forests, tidal marshes and seagrasses) is considered in Chapter 5 
of the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean, Cryosphere and Climate 
Change (SROCC), in a wider ‘blue carbon’ context.
2.6.1.5 
Bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon 
capture and storage 
An introduction and overview of bioenergy and bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can be found in Cross-Chapter 
Boxes 7 and 12, and Chapters 6 and 7. CCS technologies are 
discussed in SR15. The discussion below refers to modern bioenergy 
only (e.g., liquid biofuels for transport and the use of solid biofuels in 
combined heat and power plants). 
The mitigation potential of bioenergy coupled with CCS (i.e., BECCS), 
is estimated to be between 0.4 and 11.3 GtCO2 yr–1 (medium 
confidence) based on studies that directly estimate mitigation for 
BECCS (not bioenergy) in units of CO2 (not EJ) (McLaren 2012; 
Lenton 2014; Fuss et  al. 2018; Turner et  al. 2018b; Lenton 2010; 
Koornneef et  al. 2012; Powell and Lenton 2012). SR15 reported 
a potential of 1–85 GtCO2 yr–1 which they noted could be narrowed 
to a range of 0.5–5 GtCO2 yr–1 when taking account of sustainability 
aims (Fuss et  al. 2018). The upper end of the SR15 range is 
considered as a theoretical potential. Previously, the IPCC Special 
Report on Renewable Energy Sources  concluded the technical 
potential of biomass supply for energy (without BECCS) could reach 
100–300 EJ yr–1 by 2050, which would be 2–15 GtCO2 yr–1 (using 
conversion factors 1 EJ = 0.02–0.05 GtCO2 yr–1 emission reduction, 
SR15). A range of recent studies including sustainability or economic 
constraints estimate that 50–244 EJ (1–12 GtCO2 yr–1 using the 
conversion factors above) of bioenergy could be produced on 
0.1–13 Mkm2 of land (Fuss et al. 2018; Chan and Wu 2015; Schueler 
et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2013; Searle and Malins 2015; Wu et al. 2019; 
Heck et al. 2018; Fritz et al. 2013).
There is high confidence that the most important factors determining 
future biomass supply for energy are land availability and land 
productivity (Berndes et  al. 2013; Creutzig et  al. 2015a; Woods 
et al. 2015; Daioglou et al. 2019). Estimates of marginal/degraded 
lands currently considered available for bioenergy range from 
3.2–14.0  Mkm2, depending on the adopted sustainability criteria, 
land class definitions, soil conditions, land mapping method and 
environmental and economic considerations (Campbell et al. 2008; 
Cai et al. 2011; Lewis and Kelly 2014). 
Bioenergy production systems can lead to net emissions in the short 
term that can be ‘paid-back’ over time, with multiple harvest cycles 
and fossil fuel substitution, unlike fossil carbon emissions (Campbell 
et  al. 2008; Cai et  al. 2011; Lewis and Kelly 2014; De Oliveira 
Bordonal et al. 2015). Stabilising bioenergy crops in previous high 
carbon forestland or peatland results in high emissions of carbon 
that may take from decades to more than a century to be re-paid 
in terms of net CO2 emission savings from replacing fossil fuels,

depending on previous forest carbon stock, bioenergy yields and 
displacement efficiency (Elshout et  al. 2015; Harper et  al. 2018; 
Daioglou et  al. 2017). In the case of bioenergy from managed 
forests, the magnitude and timing of the net mitigation benefits 
is controversial as it varies with differences due to local climate 
conditions, forest management practice, fossil fuel displacement 
efficiency and methodological approaches (Hudiburg et al. 2011; 
Berndes et al. 2013; Guest et al. 2013; Lamers and Junginger 2013; 
Cherubini et al. 2016; Cintas et al. 2017; Laurance et al. 2018; Valade 
et  al. 2018; Baker et  al. 2019). Suitable bioenergy crops can be 
integrated in agricultural landscapes to reverse ecosystem carbon 
depletion (Creutzig et al. 2015a; Robertson et al. 2017; Vaughan 
et  al. 2018; Daioglou et  al. 2017). Cultivation of short rotation 
woody crops and perennial grasses on degraded land or cropland 
previously used for annual crops typically accumulate carbon in 
soils due to their deep root systems (Don et al. 2012; Robertson 
et al. 2017). The use of residues and organic waste as bioenergy 
feedstock can mitigate land use change pressures associated with 
bioenergy deployment, but residues are limited and the removal 
of residues that would otherwise be left on the soil could lead soil 
degradation (Chum et al. 2011; Liska et al. 2014; Monforti et al. 
2015; Zhao et al. 2015; Daioglou et al. 2016). 
The steps required to cultivate, harvest, transport, process and use 
biomass for energy generate emissions of GHGs and other climate 
pollutants (Chum et al. 2011; Creutzig et al. 2015b; Staples et al. 
2017; Daioglou et  al. 2019). Life-cycle GHG emissions of modern 
bioenergy alternatives are usually lower than those for fossil fuels 
(robust evidence, medium agreement) (Chum et al. 2011; Creutzig 
et al. 2015b). The magnitude of these emissions largely depends on 
location (e.g., soil quality, climate), prior land use, feedstock used 
(e.g., residues, dedicated crops, algae), land use practice (e.g., soil 
management, fertiliser use), biomass transport (e.g., distances 
and transport modes) and the bioenergy conversion pathway and 
product (e.g., wood pellets, ethanol). Use of conventional food and 
feed crops as a feedstock generally provides the highest bioenergy 
yields per hectare, but also causes more GHG emissions per unit 
energy compared to agriculture residues, biomass from managed 
forests and lignocellulosic crops such as short-rotation coppice and 
perennial grasses (Chum et al. 2011; Gerbrandt et al. 2016) due to 
the application of fertilisers and other inputs (Oates et  al. 2016; 
Rowe et al. 2016; Lai et al. 2017; Robertson et al. 2017). 
Bioenergy from dedicated crops are in some cases held responsible for 
GHG emissions resulting from indirect land use change (iLUC), that is 
the bioenergy activity may lead to displacement of agricultural or forest 
activities into other locations, driven by market-mediated effects. Other 
mitigation options may also cause iLUC. At a global level of analysis, 
indirect effects are not relevant because all land-use emissions are 
direct. iLUC emissions are potentially more significant for crop-based 
feedstocks such as corn, wheat and soybean, than for advanced biofuels 
from lignocellulosic materials (Chum et al. 2011; Wicke et al. 2012; 
Valin et al. 2015; Ahlgren and Di Lucia 2014). Estimates of emissions 
from iLUC are inherently uncertain, widely debated in the scientific 
community and are highly dependent on modelling assumptions, such 
as supply/demand elasticities, productivity estimates, incorporation 
or exclusion of emission credits for coproducts and scale of biofuel 
deployment (Rajagopal and Plevin 2013; Finkbeiner 2014; Kim et al. 
2014; Zilberman 2017). In some cases, iLUC effects are estimated to 
result in emission reductions. For example, market-mediated effects 
of bioenergy in North America showed potential for increased carbon 
stocks by inducing conversion of pasture or marginal land to forestland 
(Cintas et al. 2017; Duden et al. 2017; Dale et al. 2017; Baker et al. 
2019). There is a wide range of variability in iLUC values for different 
types of biofuels, from –75–55 gCO2 MJ–1 (Ahlgren and Di Lucia 2014; 
Valin et al. 2015; Plevin et al. 2015; Taheripour and Tyner 2013; Bento 
and Klotz 2014). There is low confidence in attribution of emissions 
from iLUC to bioenergy.
Bioenergy deployment can have large biophysical effects on 
regional climate, with the direction and magnitude of the impact 
depending on the type of bioenergy crop, previous land use and 
seasonality (limited evidence, medium agreement). A study of two 
alternative future bioenergy scenarios using 15 Mkm2 of intensively 
used managed land or conversion of natural areas showed a nearly 
neutral effect on surface temperature at global levels (considering 
biophysical effects and CO2 and N2O fluxes from land but not 
substitution effects), although there were significant seasonal 
and regional differences (Kicklighter et  al. 2013). Modelling 
studies on biofuels in the US found the switch from annual crops 
to perennial bioenergy plantations like Miscanthus could lead 
to regional cooling due to increases in evapotranspiration and 
albedo (Georgescu et al. 2011; Harding et al. 2016), with perennial 
bioenergy crop expansion over suitable abandoned and degraded 
farmlands causing near-surface cooling up to 5°C during the 
growing season (Wang et al. 2017b). Similarly, growing sugarcane 
on existing cropland in Brazil cools down the local surface during 
daytime conditions up to –1°C, but warmer conditions occur if sugar 
cane is deployed at the expense of natural vegetation (Brazilian 
Cerrado) (Loarie et al. 2011). In general, bioenergy crops (as for all 
crops) induce a cooling of ambient air during the growing season, 
but after harvest the decrease in evapotranspiration can induce 
warming (Harding et al. 2016; Georgescu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 
2017b). Bioenergy crops were found to cause increased isoprene 
emissions in a scenario where 0.69 Mkm2 of oil palm for biodiesel 
in the tropics and 0.92 Mkm2 of short rotation coppice (SRC) in 
the mid-latitudes were planted, but effects on global climate were 
negligible (Ashworth et al. 2012).
2.6.1.6 
Enhanced weathering 
Weathering is the natural process of rock decomposition via chemical 
and physical processes in which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere 
and converted to bicarbonates and/or carbonates (IPCC 2005). 
Formation of calcium carbonates in the soil provides a permanent 
sink for mineralised organic carbon (Manning 2008; Beerling et al. 
2018). Mineral weathering can be enhanced through grinding up rock 
material to increase the surface area, and distributing it over land to 
provide carbon removals of 0.5–4.0 GtCO2 yr–1 (medium confidence) 
(Beerling et al. 2018; Lenton 2010; Smith et al. 2016a; Taylor et al. 
2016). While the geochemical potential is quite large, agreement on 
the technical potential is low due to a variety of unknown parameters 
and limits, such as rates of mineral extraction, grinding, delivery and 
challenges with scaling and deployment.

2.6.1.7 
Demand management in the food sector 
(diet change, waste reduction) 
Demand-side management has the potential for climate change 
mitigation via reducing emissions from production, switching to 
consumption of less emission intensive commodities and making 
land available for CO2 removal (Section 5.5.2). Reducing food losses 
and waste increases the overall efficiency of food value chains (with 
less land and inputs needed) along the entire supply chain and has 
the potential to mitigate 0.8–4.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (high confidence) 
(Bajželj et al. 2014; Dickie et al 2014; Hawken 2017; Hiç et al. 2016) 
(Section 5.5.2.5). 
Shifting to diets that are lower in emissions-intensive foods like 
beef delivers a mitigation potential of 0.7–8.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (high 
confidence) (Bajželj et  al. 2014; Dickie et  al. 2014; Herrero et  al. 
2016; Hawken 2017; Springmann et al. 2016; Tilman and Clark 2014; 
Hedenus et al. 2014; Stehfest et al. 2009) with most of the higher 
end estimates (>6 GtCO2-eq yr–1) based on veganism, vegetarianism 
or very low ruminant meat consumption (Section 5.5.2). In 
addition to direct mitigation gains, decreasing meat consumption, 
primarily of ruminants, and reducing wastes further reduces water 
use, soil degradation, pressure on forests and land used for feed 
potentially freeing up land for mitigation (Tilman and Clark 2014) 
(Chapters 5 and 6). Additionally, consumption of locally produced 
food, shortening the supply chain, can in some cases minimise food 
loss, contribute to food security and reduce GHG emissions associated 
with energy consumption and food loss (Section 5.5.2.6). 
2.6.2 
Integrated pathways for climate 
change mitigation 
Land-based response options have the potential to interact, resulting 
in additive effects (e.g., climate co-benefits) or negating each 
other (e.g., through competition for land). They also interact with 
mitigation options in other sectors (such as energy or transport) and 
thus they need to be assessed collectively under different climate 
mitigation targets and in combination with other sustainability 
goals (Popp et al. 2017; Obersteiner et al. 2016; Humpenöder et al. 
2018). IAMs with distinctive land-use modules are the basis for 
the assessment of mitigation pathways as they combine insights 
from various disciplines in a single framework and cover the 
largest sources of anthropogenic GHG emissions from different 
sectors (see  also SR15 Chapter 2 and Technical Annex for more 
details). IAMs consider a limited, but expanding, portfolio of land-
based mitigation options. Furthermore, the inclusion and detail of 
a specific mitigation measure differs across IAMs and studies (see 
also SR15 and Chapter  6). For example, the IAM scenarios based 
on the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) (Riahi et al. 2017) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 1 and Chapter 1) include possible trends in 
agriculture and land use for five different socioeconomic futures, 
but cover a limited set of land-based mitigation options: dietary 
changes, higher efficiency in food processing (especially in livestock 
production systems), reduction of food waste, increasing agricultural 
productivity, methane reductions in rice paddies, livestock and 
grazing management for reduced methane emissions from enteric 
fermentation, manure management, improvement of N-efficiency, 
1st generation biofuels, reduced deforestation, afforestation, 2nd 
generation bioenergy crops and BECCS (Popp et al. 2017). However, 
many ‘natural climate solutions’ (Griscom et al. 2017), such as forest 
management, rangeland management, soil carbon management or 
wetland management, are not included in most of these scenarios. 
In addition, most IAMs neglect the biophysical effects of land-use 
such as changes in albedo or evapotranspiration with few exceptions 
(Kreidenweis et al. 2016).
Mitigation pathways, based on IAMs, are typically designed to find 
the least cost pathway to achieve a pre-defined climate target (Riahi 
et  al. 2017). Such cost-optimal mitigation pathways, especially in 
RCP2.6 (broadly a 2°C target) and 1.9 scenarios (broadly a 1.5°C 
target), project GHG emissions to peak early in the 21st century, 
strict GHG emission reduction afterwards and, depending on the 
climate target, net CDR from the atmosphere in the second half 
of the century (Chapter 2 of SR15; Tavoni et al. 2015; Riahi et al. 
2017). In most of these pathways, land use is of great importance 
because of its mitigation potential as discussed in Section 2.7.1: 
these pathways are based on the assumptions that (i) large-scale 
afforestation and reforestation removes substantial amounts of CO2 
from the atmosphere, (ii) biomass grown on cropland or from forestry 
residues can be used for energy generation or BECCS substituting 
fossil fuel emissions and generating CDR, and (iii) non-CO2 emissions 
from agricultural production can be reduced, even under improved 
agricultural management (Popp et  al. 2017; Rogelj et  al. 2018a; 
Van Vuuren et al. 2018, Frank et al. 2018).
From the IAM scenarios available to this assessment, a set of feasible 
mitigation pathways has been identified which is illustrative of the 
range of possible consequences on land use and GHG emissions 
(presented in this chapter) and sustainable development (Chapter 6). 
Thus, the IAM scenarios selected here vary due to underlying socio-
economic and policy assumptions, the mitigation options considered, 
long-term climate goals, the level of inclusion of other sustainability 
goals (such as land and water restrictions for biodiversity conservation 
or food production) and the models by which they are generated. 
In the baseline case without climate change mitigation, global 
CO2 emissions from land-use change decrease over time in most 
scenarios due to agricultural intensification and decreases in demand 
for agricultural commodities – some even turning negative by the 
end of the century due to abandonment of agricultural land and 
associated carbon uptake through vegetation regrowth. Median 
global CO2 emissions from land-use change across 5 SSPs and 5 IAMs 
decrease throughout the 21st century: 3, 1.9 and –0.7 GtCO2 yr–1 in 
2030, 2050 and 2100 respectively (Figure 2.25). In contrast, CH4 and 
N2O emissions from agricultural production remain rather constant 
throughout the 21st century (CH4: 214, 231.7 and 209.1 MtCH4 yr–1 in 
2030, 2050 and 2100 respectively; N2O: 9.1, 10.1 and 10.3 MtN2O yr–1 
in 2030, 2050 and 2100 respectively). 
In the mitigation cases (RCP4.5, RCP2.6 and RCP1.9), most of 
the scenarios indicate strong reductions in CO2 emissions due to 
(i) reduced deforestation and (ii) carbon uptake due to afforestation. 
However, CO2 emissions from land use can occur in some mitigation

scenarios as a result of weak land-use change regulation (Fujimori 
et al. 2017; Calvin et al. 2017) or displacement effects into pasture 
land caused by high bioenergy production combined with forest 
protection only (Popp et  al. 2014). The level of CO2 removal 
globally (median value across SSPs and IAMs) increases with the 
stringency of the climate target (RCP4.5, RCP2.6 and RCP1.9) for 
both afforestation (–1.3, –1.7 and –2.4 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2100) and 
BECCS (–6.5, –11 and –14.9 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2100) (Cross-Chapter 
Box 7 and Chapter 6). In the mitigation cases (RCP4.5, RCP2.6 and 
RCP1.9), CH4 and N2O emissions are remarkably lower compared to 
the baseline case (CH4: 133.2, 108.4 and 73.5 MtCH4 yr–1 in 2100; 
N2O: 7.4, 6.1 and 4.5 MtN2O yr–1 in 2100; see previous paragraph 
for CH4 and N2O emissions in the baseline case). The reductions 
in the mitigation cases are mainly due to improved agricultural 
management such as improved nitrogen fertiliser management, 
improved water management in rice production, improved manure 
management (by, for example, covering of storages or adoption 
of biogas plants), better herd management and better quality of 
livestock through breeding and improved feeding practices. In 
addition, dietary shifts away from emission-intensive livestock 
products also lead to decreased CH4 and N2O emissions especially 
in RCP2.6 and RCP1.9 scenarios. However, high levels of bioenergy 
production can result in increased N2O emissions due to nitrogen 
fertilisation of dedicated bioenergy crops.
Such high levels of CO2 removal through mitigation options that 
require land conversion (BECCS and afforestation) shape the land 
system dramatically (Figure 2.26). Across the different RCPs, SSPs and 
IAMs, median change of global forest area throughout the 21st century 
ranges from about –0.2 to +7.2 Mkm2 between 2010 and 2100, and 
agricultural land used for 2nd generation bioenergy crop production 
ranges from about 3.2–6.6 Mkm2 in 2100 (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj 
et  al. 2018). Land requirements for bioenergy and afforestation 
for a RCP1.9 scenario are higher than for a  RCP2.6 scenario and

especially a RCP4.5 mitigation scenario. As a  consequence of the 
expansion of mainly land-demanding mitigation options, global 
pasture land is reduced in most mitigation scenarios much more 
strongly than compared to baseline scenarios (median reduction 
of 0, 2.6, 5.1 and 7.5 Mkm2 between 2010 and 2100 in baseline, 
RCP4.5, RCP2.6 and RCP1.9 respectively). In addition, cropland 
for food and feed production decreases with the stringency of the 
climate target (+1.2, +0.2, –1.8 and –4 Mkm2 in 2100 compared 
to 2010 in baseline, RCP4.5, RCP2.6 and RCP1.9 respectively). These 
reductions in agricultural land for food and feed production are 
facilitated by agricultural intensifi cation on agricultural land and in 
livestock production systems (Popp et al. 2017), but also by changes 
in consumption patterns (Fujimori et al. 2017; Frank et al. 2017b). 
The pace of projected land-use change over the coming decades in 
ambitious mitigation scenarios goes well beyond historical changes 
in some instances (Turner et al. (2018b), see also SR15). This raises 
issues for societal acceptance, and distinct policy and governance 
for avoiding negative consequences for other sustainability goals 
will be required (Humpenöder et al. 2018; Obersteiner et al. 2016; 
Calvin et al. 2014) (Chapters 6 and 7). 
Different mitigation strategies can achieve the net emissions 
reductions that would be required to follow a pathway that limits 
global warming to 2°C or 1.5°C, with very different consequences on 
the land system.

Figure 2.27 shows six alternative pathways (archetypes) for achieving 
ambitious climate targets (RCP2.6 and RCP1.9), highlighting land-
based strategies and GHG emissions. All pathways are assessed 
by different models but are all based on the SSP2 (Riahi et  al. 
2017), with all based on an RCP 1.9 mitigation pathway expect 
for Pathway 1, which is RCP2.6. All scenarios show land-based 
negative emissions, but the amount varies across pathways, as do 
the relative contributions of different land-based CDR options, such 
as afforestation/reforestation and BECCS.
Pathway 1 RCP2.6 ‘Portfolio’ (Fricko et  al. 2017) shows a strong 
near-term decrease of CO2 emissions from land-use change, mainly 
due to reduced deforestation, as well as slightly decreasing N2O 
and CH4 emissions after 2050 from agricultural production due to 
improved agricultural management and dietary shifts away from 
emissions-intensive livestock products. However, in contrast to CO2
emissions, which turn net-negative around 2050 due to afforestation/
reforestation, CH4 and N2O emissions persist throughout the century 
due to diffi culties of eliminating these residual emissions based on 
existing agricultural management methods (Stevanović et al. 2017; 
Frank et al. 2017b). In addition to abating land related GHG emissions 
as well as increasing the terrestrial sink, this example also shows the 
importance of the land sector in providing biomass for BECCS and 
hence CDR in the energy sector. In this scenario, annual BECCS-based 
CDR is about three times higher than afforestation-based CDR in 2100 
(–11.4 and –3.8 GtCO2 yr–1 respectively). Cumulative CDR throughout 
the century amounts to –395 GtCO2 for BECCS and –73 GtCO2 for 
afforestation. Based on these GHG dynamics, the land sector turns 
GHG emission neutral in 2100. However, accounting also for BECCS-
based CDR taking place in the energy sector, but with biomass provided 
by the land sector, turns the land sector GHG emission neutral already 
in 2060, and signifi cantly net-negative by the end of the century. 
Pathway 2 RCP1.9 ‘Increased Ambition’ (Rogelj et  al. 2018) has 
dynamics of land-based GHG emissions and removals that are 
very similar to those in Pathway 1 (RCP2.6) but all GHG emission 
reductions as well as afforestation/reforestation and BECCS-based 
CDR start earlier in time at a higher rate of deployment. Cumulative 
CDR throughout the century amounts to –466 GtCO2 for BECCS and 
–117 GtCO2 for afforestation.

F igure 2.27 |  Evolution and breakdown of global land-based GHG emissions and removals under six alternative mitigation pathways. This fi gure illustrates 
the differences in timing and magnitude of land-based mitigation approaches including afforestation and BECCS. All pathways are based on different IAM realisations of SSP2. 
Pathway 1 is based on RCP 2.6, while all other pathways are based on RCP 1.9. Pathway 1: MESSAGE-GLOBIOM (Fricko et al. 2017); Pathway 2: MESSAGE-GLOBIOM (Rogelj 
et al. 2018); Pathway 3: REMIND-MAgPIE (Kriegler et al. 2017); Pathway 4: REMIND-MAgPIE (Bertram et al. 2018); Pathway 5: IMAGE (van Vuuren et al. 2018); Pathway 6: 
MESSAGE-GLOBIOM (Grubler et al. 2018). Data is from an update of the IAMC Scenario Explorer developed for the SR15 (Rogelj et al. 2018). The categories CO2 Land, CH4
Land and N2O Land include GHG emissions from land-use change and agricultural land use (including emissions related to bioenergy production). In addition, the category CO2
Land includes negative emissions due to afforestation. BECCS refl ects the CO2 emissions captured from bioenergy use and stored in geological deposits. Solid lines show the 
net effect of all land based GHG emissions and removals (CO2 Land, CH4 Land, N2O Land and BECCS), while dashed lines show the net effect excluding BECCS. CH4 and N2O 
emissions are converted to CO2-eq using GWP factors of 28 and 265 respectively.

Pathway 3 RCP 1.9 ‘Only BECCS’, in contrast to Pathway 2, includes 
only BECCS-based CDR (Kriegler et  al. 2017). As a consequence, 
CO2 emissions are persistent much longer, predominantly from 
indirect land-use change due to large-scale bioenergy cropland 
expansion into non-protected natural areas (Popp et al. 2017; Calvin 
et al. 2014). While annual BECCS CDR rates in 2100 are similar to 
Pathways 1 and 2 (–15.9 GtCO2 yr–1), cumulative BECCS-based CDR 
throughout the century is much larger (–944 GtCO2). 
Pathway 4 RCP1.9 ‘Early CDR’ (Bertram et al. 2018) indicates that 
a significant reduction in the later century in the BECCS-related CDR 
as well as CDR in general can be achieved with earlier and mainly 
terrestrial CDR, starting in 2030. In this scenario, terrestrial CDR is 
based on afforestation but could also be supported by soil organic 
carbon sequestration (Paustian et al. 2016) or other natural climate 
solutions, such as rangeland or forest management (Griscom et al. 
2017). This scenario highlights the importance of the timing for CDR-
based mitigation pathways (Obersteiner et al. 2016). As a result of 
near-term and mainly terrestrial CDR deployment, cumulative BECCS-
based CDR throughout the century is limited to –300 GtCO2, while 
cumulative afforestation-based CDR amounts to –428 GtCO2.
In Pathway 5 RCP1.9 ‘Low residual emissions’ (van Vuuren et  al. 
2018), land-based mitigation is driven by stringent enforcement of 
measures and technologies to reduce end-of-pipe non-CO2 emissions 
and by introduction of in-vitro (cultured) meat, reducing residual N2O 
and CH4 emissions from agricultural production. In consequence, 
much lower amounts of CDR from afforestation and BECCS are 
needed with much later entry points to compensate for residual 
emissions. Cumulative CDR throughout the century amounts to 
–252 GtCO2 for BECCS and –128 GtCO2 for afforestation. Therefore, 
total cumulative land-based CDR in Pathway 5 is substantially lower 
compared to Pathways 2–4 (380 GtCO2). 
Finally, Pathway 6 RCP1.9 ‘Low Energy’ (Grubler et al. 2018), equivalent 
to Pathway LED in SR15, indicates the importance of other sectoral 
GHG emission reductions for the land sector. In this example, rapid and 
early reductions in energy demand and associated drops in energy-
related CO2 emissions limit overshoot and decrease the requirements 
for negative emissions technologies, especially for land-demanding 
CDR, such as biomass production for BECCS and afforestation. While 
BECCS is not used at all in Pathway 6, cumulative CDR throughout the 
century for afforestation amounts to –124 GtCO2.
Besides their consequences on mitigation pathways and land 
consequences, those archetypes can also affect multiple other 
sustainable development goals that provide both challenges and 
opportunities for climate action (Chapter 6). 
2.6.3 
The contribution of response options 
to the Paris Agreement 
The previous sections indicated how land-based response options 
have the potential to contribute to the Paris Agreement, not only 
3 
CO2 fluxes due to land use, land-use change and forestry, in essence, not including the part of AFOLU fluxes that are from agriculture.
though reducing anthropogenic emissions but also for providing 
anthropogenic sinks that can contribute to “…a balance between 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of 
greenhouse gases in the second half of this century…” (Paris 
Agreement, Article 4). The balance applies globally, and relates only 
to GHGs, not aerosols (Section 2.4) or biophysical effects (Section 2.5). 
The Paris Agreement includes an enhanced transparency framework 
to track countries’ progress towards achieving their individual 
targets (i.e., nationally determined contributions (NDCs)), and 
a global stocktake (every five years starting in 2023), to assess the 
countries’ collective progress towards the long-term goals of the Paris 
Agreement. The importance of robust and transparent definitions 
and methods (including the approach to separating anthropogenic 
from natural fluxes) (Fuglestvedt et  al. 2018), and the needs for 
reconciling country GHG inventories and models (Grassi et al. 2018a), 
was highlighted in Section 2.3 in relation to estimating emissions. 
Issues around estimating mitigation is also key to transparency and 
credibility and is part of the Paris Rulebook. 
The land sector is expected to deliver up to 25% of GHG mitigation 
pledged by countries by 2025–2030 in their NDCs, based on early 
assessments of ‘Intended’ NDCs submitted ahead of the Paris 
Agreement and updates immediately after (low confidence) (Grassi 
et al. 2017; Forsell et al. 2016). While most NDCs submitted to date 
include commitments related to the land sector, they vary with 
how much information is given and the type of target, with more 
ambitious targets for developing countries often being ‘conditional’ 
on support and climate finance. Some do not specify the role of 
AFOLU but include it implicitly as part of economy-wide pledges 
(e.g., reducing total emission or emission intensity), a few mention 
multi-sectoral mitigation targets which include AFOLU in a fairly 
unspecified manner. Many NDCs include specific AFOLU response 
options, with most focused on the role of forests. A few included soil 
carbon sequestration or agricultural mitigation and a few explicitly 
mentioned bioenergy (e.g., Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia), but 
this could be implicitly included with reduced emissions in energy 
sectors through fuel substitution (see Cross-Chapter Box 7 and 
Chapter 6 for discussion on cross sector flux reporting). The countries 
indicating AFOLU mitigation most prominently were Brazil and 
Indonesia, followed by other countries focusing either on avoiding 
carbon emissions (e.g., Ethiopia, Gabon, Mexico, DRC, Guyana and 
Madagascar) or on promoting the sink through large afforestation 
programmes (e.g., China, India) (Grassi et al. 2017).
Figure 2.28 shows the CO2 mitigation potential of NDCs compared 
to historical fluxes from LULUCF.3 It shows future fluxes based on 
current policies in place and on country-stated Business As Usual 
(BAU) activities (these are different from current policies as many 
countries are already implementing polices that they do not include as 
part of their historical business-as-usual baseline) (Grassi et al. 2017). 
Under implementation of unconditional pledges, the net LULUCF flux 
in 2030 has been estimated to be a sink of –0.41 ± 0.68 GtCO2 yr–1, 
which increases to –1.14 ± 0.48 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2030 with conditional 
activities. This compares to net LULUCF in 2010 calculated from 
200
Chapter 2

the GHG Inventories of 0.01 ± 0.86 GtCO2 yr–1 (Grassi et al. 2017). 
Forsell et al. (2016) similarly find a reduction in 2030 compared to 
2010 of 0.5 GtCO2 yr–1 (range: 0.2–0.8) by 2020 and 0.9 GtCO2 yr–1 
(range: 0.5–1.3) by 2030 for unconditional and conditional cases. 
The approach of countries to calculating the LULUCF contribution 
towards the NDC varies, with implications for comparability and 
transparency. For example, by following the different approaches 
used to include LULUCF in country NDCs, Grassi et al. (2017) found 
a three-fold difference in estimated mitigation: 1.2–1.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
when 2030 expected emissions are compared to 2005 emissions, 
0.7–1.4 GtCO2-eq yr–1 when 2030 emissions are compared to 
reference scenarios based on current policies or 2.3–3.0 GtCO2-eq yr–1 
when compared to BAU, and 3.0–3.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 when based on 
using each countries’ approach to calculation stated in the NDC

In exploring the effectiveness of the NDCs, SR15 concluded 
“[e]stimates of global average temperature increase are 2.9°–3.4°C 
above preindustrial levels with a greater than 66% probability 
by 2100” (Roberts et  al. 2006; Rogelj et  al. 2016), under a full 
implementation of unconditional NDCs and a continuation of climate 
action similar to that of the NDCs. In order to achieve either the 1.5°C 
or 2°C pathways, this shortfall would imply the need for submission 
(and achievement) of more ambitious NDCs, and plan for a more 
rapid transformation of their national energy, industry, transport 
and land use sectors (Peters and Geden 2017; Millar et  al. 2017; 
Rogelj et al. 2016).

Response options relying on the use of land could provide around 
a third of the additional mitigation needed in the near term (2030) to 
close the gap between current policy trajectories based on NDCs and 
what is required to achieve a 2°C (>66% chance) or 1.5°C (50–66% 
chance) pathway according to the UNEP Emissions Gap Report (Roberts 
et al. 2006). The report estimates annual reduction potentials in 2030 
from agriculture at 3.0 (2.3–3.7) GtCO2-eq yr–1, a combination of 
‘uncertain measures’ (biochar, peat-related emission reductions and 
demand-side management) at 3.7 (2.6–4.8) GtCO2-eq yr–1; forests 
at 5.3 (4.1–6.5) GtCO2-eq yr–1, bioenergy at 0.9 GtCO2-eq yr–1 and 
BECCS at 0.3 (0.2–0.4) GtCO2-eq yr–1 (UNEP 2017) (Table 4.1). These 
response options account for 35% of potential reduction (or 32% 
without bioenergy and BECCS) out of a total (all sector) potential 
of 38 (35–41) GtCO2-eq yr–1. The potentials estimated in the UNEP 
Emissions Gap Report are based on the technical potential of 
individual response options from literature including that presented 
in Section 2.1. CDR related to land use, while not a substitute for 
strong action in the energy sector, has the technical potential to 
balance unavoidable emissions that are difficult to eliminate with 
current technologies (high confidence), with early action avoiding 
deeper and more rapid action later (very high confidence) (Strefler 
et al. 2018; Elmar et al. 2018; SR15). 
2.7 
Plant and soil processes underlying 
land–climate interactions
Projecting future complex interactions between land and climate 
require ESMs. A growing number of studies suggested that many 
processes important for interactions between land and climate were 
missing in the CMIP5-class ESMs and that the DGVMs used tended 
to elevate CO2 emission and removals (high confidence) (Busch and 
Sage 2017; Rogers et al. 2017; Anderegg et al. 2016; Tjoelker 2018; 
Sulman et al. 2014; Wieder et al. 2018; Davidson et al. 2006a).
Ecosystem complexity stemming from the diversity of plants, animals 
and microbes, as well as their biological responses to gradual 
climate changes (e.g., adaptive migration) and disturbance events 
(e.g., extreme weather events, fire, pest outbreaks) (Section 2.2), are 
of potential importance. Of these processes, this section focuses on 
plant and soil processes as recent empirical work, including those 
explained in the following subsections, offers potential for improved 
model projections under warmer and CO2-rich futures. 
The magnitude of future uptake and release of CO2 and other GHGs 
by vegetation are among the greatest uncertainties (Ciais  et  al. 
2013b). One reason for this uncertainty stems from the lack of 
understanding of the mechanisms responsible for plant responses 
to increasing temperatures. The short- and long-term projections of 
gross photosynthesis responses to changes in temperature, CO2 and 
nutrient availability vary greatly among the models (Busch and Sage 
2017; Rogers et  al. 2017). Net CO2 exchange requires estimation 
of autotrophic respiration, which is another source of uncertainty 
in ESM projections (Malhi et  al. 2011). The importance of plant 
acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration in understanding 
vegetation response to climate change is now widely recognised 
(high confidence) (Rogers et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2017; Tjoelker, 2018; 
Vanderwel et al., 2015) (Section 2.7.1). Acclimation is broadly defined 
as the biochemical, physiological, morphological or developmental 
adjustments within the lifetime of organisms that result in improved 
performance under the new condition. Acclimation often operates 
over a time span of days to weeks, and can mitigate the negative 
effects of climate change on organismal growth and ecosystem 
functions (Tjoelker 2018). 
Soil carbon and microbial processes, which interact with plant 
responses to climate, represent another large source of uncertainty 
in model projections (medium confidence) (Sections 2.7.2, 2.7.3 
and  2.7.4). Given the wide range of uncertainty associated with 
SOC size estimates, CMIP5 models use a wide range of starting SOC 
stocks from 510–3040 GtC (Todd-Brown et al. 2013). Soil microbial 
respiration is estimated to release 40–70 GtC annually from the soil to 
the atmosphere globally (Hawkes et al. 2017). Projections of changes 
in global SOC stocks during the 21st century by CMIP5 models 
also ranged widely, from a loss of 37 Gt to a gain of 146 Gt, with 
differences largely explained by initial SOC stocks, differing carbon 
input rates and different decomposition rates and temperature 
sensitivities (Todd-Brown et al. 2013). With respect to land–climate 
interactions, the key processes affecting SOC stocks are warming 
(which is expected to accelerate SOC losses through microbial 
respiration) and acceleration of plant growth (which increases inputs 
of carbon to soils). However, complex mechanisms underlying SOC 
responses to moisture regimes, carbon addition, and warming drive 
considerable uncertainty in projections of future changes in SOC 
stocks (Sulman et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2010; Wieder et al. 2018).
2.7.1 
Temperature responses of plant 
and ecosystem production
Climate-change responses of net ecosystem production cannot be 
modelled by simple instantaneous response functions because of 
thermal acclimation responses of plants and soil microbes, as well 
as delayed responses arising from interactions between plants 
and the soil (high confidence) (Slot et al. 2014; Rogers et al. 2017; 
Tan et  al. 2017; Tjoelker 2018). Photosynthesis and respiration of 
component plant species exhibit different functional shapes among 
species (Slot et al. 2014), and carbon balance at the stand level is 
influenced by respiration of ecosystem biomass other than plants. 
Large uncertainty remains for thermal responses of bacteria and 
other soil organisms (Section 2.7.5). Bayesian statistical estimates of 
global photosynthesis and total ecosystem respirations suggest that 
they exhibit different responses to thermal anomalies during the last 
35 years (Li et al. 2018b).
Thermal responses of plant respiration, which consumes approximately 
one half of GPP, have not been appropriately incorporated in most 
ESMs (Davidson et al., 2006; Tjoelker, 2018). Assumptions associated 
with respiration have been a major source of uncertainty for ESMs 
at the time of AR5. In most existing models, a simple assumption 
that respiration doubles with each 10°C increase of temperature 
(i.e., Q10 = 2) is adopted, ignoring acclimation. Even a small error 
stemming from this assumption can strongly influence estimated 
net carbon balance at large spatial scales of ecosystems and biomes 
202

over the time period of multiple decades (Smith and Dukes 2013; 
Smith et al. 2016b). In order to estimate more appropriate thermal 
response curves of respiration, a global database including data 
from 899 plant species has been compiled (Atkin et al. 2015), and 
respiration data from 231 plants species across seven biomes 
have been analysed (Heskel et  al. 2016). These empirical data on 
thermal responses of respiration demonstrate a globally convergent 
pattern (Huntingford et al. 2017). According to a sensitivity analysis 
of a relatively small number of ESMs, a newly derived function of 
instantaneous responses of plant respiration to temperature (instead 
of a traditional exponential function of Q10 = 2) makes a significant 
difference in estimated autotrophic respiration especially in cold 
biomes (Heskel et al. 2016).
Acclimation results in reduced sensitivity of plant respiration with 
rising temperature, in essence, down regulation of warming-related 
increase in respiratory carbon emission (high confidence) (Atkin et al. 
2015; Slot and Kitajima 2015; Tjoelker 2018). For example, 
experimental data from a tropical forest canopy show that temperature 
acclimation ameliorates the negative effects of rising temperature to 
leaf and plant carbon balance (Slot et al. 2014). Analysis of CO2 flux 
data to quantify optimal temperature of net primary production of 
tropical forests also suggest acclimation potential for many tropical 
forests (Tan et al. 2017). Comparisons of models with and without 
thermal acclimation of respiration show that acclimation can halve 
the increase of plant respiration with projected temperature increase 
by the end of 21st century (Vanderwel et al. 2015).
It is typical that acclimation response to warming results in increases 
of the optimum temperature for photosynthesis and growth (Slot and 
Winter 2017; Yamori et al. 2014; Rogers et al. 2017). Although such 
shift is a result of a complex interactions of biochemical, respiratory 
and stomatal regulation (Lloyd and Farquhar 2008), it can be 
approximated by a simple algorithm to address acclimation (Kattge 
et al. 2007). Mercado et al. (2018), using this approach, found that 
inclusion of biogeographical variation in photosynthetic temperature 
response was critically important for estimating future land surface 
carbon uptake. In the tropics, CO2 fertilisation effect (Box 2.3) is 
suggested to be more important for observed increases in carbon 
sink strength than increased leaf area index or a longer growing 
season (Zhu et al. 2016). Acclimation responses of photosynthesis and 
growth to simultaneous changes of temperature and CO2, as well as 
stress responses above the optimal temperature for photosynthesis, 
remain a major knowledge gap in modelling responses of plant 
productivity under future climate change (Rogers et al. 2017).
2.7.2 
Water transport through soil-plant-atmosphere 
continuum and drought mortality
How climate change, especially changes of precipitation patterns, 
influence water transport through the soil-plant-atmosphere 
continuum, is a key element in projecting the future of water vapour 
flux from land and cooling via latent heat flux (high confidence) 
(Sellers et al. 1996; Bonan 2008; Brodribb 2009; Choat et al. 2012; 
Sperry and Love 2015; Novick et al. 2016; Sulman et al. 2016). Even 
without changes in leaf area per unit area of land, when plants 
close stomata in response to water shortage, dry atmosphere or 
soil moisture deficit, the stand-level fluxes of water (and associated 
latent heat flux) decrease (Seneviratne et al. 2018). Closing stomata 
enhances drought survival at the cost of reduced photosynthetic 
production, while not closing stomata avoids loss of photosynthetic 
production at the cost of increased drought mortality (Sperry and 
Love 2015). Hence, species-specific responses to drought, in terms 
of whether they close stomata or not, have short- and long-term 
consequences (Anderegg et al. 2018a; Buotte et al. 2019). Increased 
drought-induced mortality of forest trees, often exacerbated by insect 
outbreak and fire (e.g., Breshears et al. (2005), Kurz et al. (2008), Allen 
et al. (2010)) (Section 2.2.4), have long-term impact on hydrological 
interactions between land and atmosphere (Anderegg et al. 2018b). 
New models linking plant water transport with canopy gas exchange 
and energy fluxes are expected to improve projections of climate 
change impacts on forests and land-atmosphere interactions (medium 
confidence) (Bohrer et al., 2005; Anderegg et al., 2016; Sperry and 
Love, 2015; Wolf et al., 2016). Yet, there is much uncertainty in the 
ability of current vegetation and land surface models to adequately 
capture tree mortality and the response of forests to climate 
extremes like drought (Rogers et al. 2017; Hartmann et al. 2018). 
Most vegetation models use climate stress envelopes or vegetation 
carbon balance estimations to project climate-driven mortality and 
loss of forests (McDowell et  al. 2011); these may not adequately 
project biome shifts and impacts of disturbance in future climates. 
For example, a suite of vegetation models was compared to a field 
drought experiment in the Amazon on mature rainforest trees and all 
models performed poorly in projecting the timing and magnitude of 
biomass loss due to drought (Powell et al. 2013). More recently, the 
loss of water transport due to embolism (disruption of xylem water 
continuity) (Sperry and Love 2015), rather than carbon starvation 
(Rowland et al. 2015), is receiving attention as a key physiological 
process relevant for drought-induced tree mortality (Hartmann et al. 
2018). A key challenge to modelling efforts is to consider differences 
among plant species and vegetation types in their drought responses. 
One approach is to classify plant species to ‘functional types’ that 
exhibit similar responses to environmental variations (Anderegg 
et al. 2016). Certain traits of species, such as tree height, is shown to 
be predictive of growth decline and mortality in response to drought 
(Xu et al. 2016a). Similarly, tree rooting depth is positively related 
to mortality, contrary to expectation, during prolonged droughts in 
tropical dry forest (Chitra-Tarak et al. 2017). 
2.7.3 
Soil microbial effects on soil nutrient dynamics 
and plant responses to elevated CO2
Soil microbial processes influencing nutrient and carbon dynamics 
represent a large source of uncertainty in projecting land–climate 
interactions. For example, ESMs incorporating nitrogen and 
phosphorus limitations (but without considering the effects of 
mycorrhizae and rhizosphere priming) indicate that the simulated 
future carbon-uptake on land is reduced significantly when both 
nitrogen and phosphorus are limited as compared to only carbon-
stimulation, by 63% (of 197 Pg C) under RCP2.6 and by 67% 
(of 425 Pg C) under RCP8.5 (Zhang et al. 2013c). Mineral nutrient 
203
Land–climate interactions

limitation progressively reduces the CO2 fertilisation effects on 
plant growth and productivity over time (robust evidence, medium 
agreement) (Norby et al. 2010; Sardans et al. 2012; Reich and Hobbie 
2013; Feng et al. 2015; Terrer et al. 2017). The rates at which nutrient 
limitation develops differ among studies and sites. A recent meta-
analysis shows that experimental CO2 enrichment generally results 
in lower nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in plant tissues 
(Du et al. 2019), and isotopic analysis also suggest a global trend of 
decreases in leaf nutrient concentration (Craine et al. 2018; Jonard 
et al. 2015). However, reduced responses to elevated CO2 (eCO2) may 
not be a simple function of nitrogen dilution per se, as they result from 
complex interactions of ecosystem factors that influence nitrogen 
acquisition by plants (Liang et al. 2016; Rutting 2017; Du et al. 2019).
Increasing numbers of case studies suggest that soil microbial 
processes, such as nitrogen mineralisation rates and symbiosis with 
plants, influence nutrient limitation on eCO2 effects on plant growth 
(medium confidence) (Drake et al. 2011; Zak et al. 2011; Hungate 
et al. 2013; Talhelm et al. 2014; Du et al. 2019). Rhizosphere priming 
effects (i.e., release of organic matters by roots to stimulate microbial 
activities) and mycorrhizal associations are proposed to explain why 
some sites are becoming nitrogen limited after a few years and others 
are sustaining growth through accelerated nitrogen uptake (limited 
evidence, medium agreement) (Phillips et al. 2011; Terrer et al. 2017).
Model assessments that including rhizosphere priming effects 
and ectomycorrhizal symbiosis suggest that soil organic matter 
(SOM) cycling is accelerated through microbial symbiosis (medium 
confidence) (Elbert et  al. 2012; Sulman et  al. 2017; Orwin et  al. 
2011; Baskaran et al. 2017). Uncertainty exists in differences among 
ectomycorrhizal fungal species in their ability to decompose SOM 
(Pellitier and Zak 2018) and the capacity of ecosystems to sustain 
long-term growth with these positive symbiotic feedbacks is still 
under debate (Terrer et al. 2017). ESMs include only biological nitrogen 
cycles, even though a recent study suggests that bedrock weathering 
can be a significant source of nitrogen to plants (Houlton et  al. 
2018). In contrast, rock weathering is widely considered to be key for 
phosphorus availability, and tropical forests with highly weathered 
soils are considered to be limited by phosphorus availability rather 
than nitrogen availability (Reed et  al. 2015). Yet evidence from 
phosphorus fertilisation experiments is lacking (Schulte-Uebbing 
and de Vries 2018) and phosphorus limitation of tropical tree growth 
may be strongly species-specific (Ellsworth et al. 2017; Turner et al. 
2018a). Limitation by availability of soil nutrients other than nitrogen 
and phosphorus has not been studied in the context of land–climate 
interactions, except potassium as a potentially limiting factor for 
terrestrial plant productivity in interaction with nitrogen, phosphorus 
and hydrology (Sardans and Peñuelas 2015; Zhao et  al. 2017; 
Wright et al. 2018).
Anthropogenic alteration of global and regional nitrogen and 
phosphorus cycles, largely through use of chemical fertilisers 
and pollution, has major implications for future ecosystem attributes, 
including carbon storage, in natural and managed ecosystems (high 
confidence) (Peñuelas et al. 2013, 2017; Wang et al. 2017c; Schulte-
Uebbing and de Vries 2018; Yuan et al. 2018). During 1997–2013, 
the contribution of nitrogen deposition to the global carbon sink 
has been estimated at 0.27 ± 0.13 GtC yr–1, and the contribution 
of phosphorus deposition as 0.054 ± 0.10 GtC yr–1; these constitute 
about 9% and 2% of the total land carbon sink, respectively 
(Wang et al. 2017c). Anthropogenic deposition of nitrogen enhances 
carbon sequestration by vegetation (Schulte-Uebbing and de Vries 
2018), but this effect of nitrogen deposition on carbon sequestration 
may be offset by increased emission of GHGs such as N2O and CH4 
(Liu and Greaver 2009). Furthermore, nitrogen deposition may lead 
to imbalance of nitrogen vs phosphorus availability (Peñuelas et al. 
2013), soil microbial activity and SOM decomposition (Janssens et al. 
2010) and reduced ecosystem stability (Chen et al. 2016b).
2.7.4 
Vertical distribution of soil organic carbon 
It has long been recognised that dynamics of soil organic carbon 
(SOC) represent a large source of uncertainties on biogeochemical 
interactions of land with atmosphere and climate as detailed below. 
Since AR5, there have been new understandings on SOC size, as well 
as on the microbial processes that influence SOM dynamics under 
climate change and LULCC. Three existing databases (SoilGrids, the 
Harmonized World Soil Data Base and Northern Circumpolar Soil 
Database) substantially differ in the estimated size of global SOC 
stock down to 1 m depth, varying between 2500 Pg to 3400 Pg with 
differences among databases largely attributable to carbon stored 
in permafrost (Joosten 2015; Köchy et al. 2015; Tifafi et al. 2018). 
These values are four to eight times larger than the carbon stock 
associated with the terrestrial vegetation (Bond-Lamberty et  al. 
2018). New estimates since AR5 show that much larger areas in the 
Amazon and Congo basins are peatlands (Gumbricht et al. 2017; 
Dargie et al. 2019).
Deep soil layers can contain much more carbon than previously 
assumed (limited evidence, medium agreement) (e.g., González-
Jaramillo et al. (2016)). Based on radiocarbon measurements, deep 
SOC can be very old, with residence times up to several thousand 
years (Rumpel and Kögel-Knabner 2011) or even several tens 
of thousands of years (Okuno and Nakamura 2003). Dynamics 
associated with such deeply buried carbon remain poorly studied 
and ignored by the models, and are not addressed in most of the 
studies assessed in this subsection. Deep soil carbon is thought to 
be stabilised by mineral interactions, but recent experiments suggest 
that CO2 release from deep soils can also be increased by warming, 
with a 4˚C warming enhancing annual soil respiration by 34–37% 
(Hicks Pries et al. 2017), or with the addition of fresh carbon (Fontaine 
et al. 2007). While erosion is not typically modelled as a carbon flux 
in ESMs, erosion and burial of carbon-containing sediments is likely 
a significant carbon transfer from land to ocean (medium confidence) 
(Berhe et al. 2007; Asefaw et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2017e).
2.7.5 
Soil carbon responses to warming 
and changes in soil moisture
Annually, 119 GtC is estimated to be emitted from the terrestrial 
ecosystem to the atmosphere, of which about 50% is attributed to 
soil microbial respiration (Auffret et al. 2016; Shao et al. 2013). It is 
204

Land–climate interactions

yet not possible to make mechanistic and quantitative projections 
about how multiple environmental factors influence soil microbial 
respiration (Davidson et al. 2006a; Dungait et al. 2012). Soil warming 
experiments show significant variability in temperature and moisture 
responses across biomes and climates; Crowther et al. (2016) found 
that warming-induced SOC loss is greater in regions with high initial 
carbon stocks, while an analysis of an expanded version of the same 
dataset did not support this conclusion (Gestel et al. 2018). Studies 
of SOC responses to warming over time have also shown complex 
responses. In a multi-decadal warming experiment, Melillo et  al. 
(2017) found that soil respiration response to warming went through 
multiple phases of increasing and decreasing strength, which were 
related to changes in microbial communities and available substrates 
over time. Conant et al. (2011) and Knorr et al. (2005) suggested that 
transient decomposition responses to warming could be explained by 
depletion of labile substrates, but that long-term SOC losses could be 
amplified by high temperature sensitivity of slowly decomposing SOC 
components. Overall, long-term SOC responses to warming remain 
uncertain (Davidson et al. 2006a; Dungait et al. 2012; Nishina et al. 
2014; Tian et al. 2015).
It is widely known that soil moisture plays an important role in SOM 
decomposition by influencing microbial processes (e.g., Monard 
et al. (2012), Moyano et al. (2013), Yan et al. (2018)), as confirmed 
by a recent global meta-analysis (high confidence) (Hawkes et al. 
2017). A likely mechanism is that increased soil moisture lowers 
carbon mineralisation rates under anaerobic conditions, resulting in 
enhanced carbon stocks, but experimental analyses have shown that 
this effect may last for only 3–4 weeks after which iron reduction can 
actually accelerate the loss of previously protected OC by facilitating 
microbial access (Huang and Hall 2017).
Experimental studies of responses of microbial respiration to 
warming have found variable results (Luo et al. 2001; Bradford et al. 
2008; Zhou et  al. 2011; Carey et  al. 2016; Teramoto et  al. 2016). 
No acclimation was observed in carbon-rich calcareous temperate 
forest soils (Schindlbacher et al. 2015) and arctic soils (Hartley et al. 
2008), and a variety of ecosystems from the Arctic to the Amazon 
indicated that microbes appear to enhance the temperature sensitivity 
of soil respiration in Arctic and boreal soils, thereby releasing even 
more carbon than currently projected (Karhu et al. 2014). In tropical 
forests, phosphorus limitation of microbial processes is a key factor 
influencing soil respiration (Camenzind et  al. 2018). Temperature 
responses of symbiotic mycorrhizae differ widely among host plant 
species, without a clear pattern that may allow generalisation across 
plant species and vegetation types (Fahey et al. 2016).
Some new insights have been obtained since AR5 from investigations 
of improved mechanistic understanding of factors that regulate 
temperature responses of soil microbial respiration. Carbon use 
efficiency and soil nitrogen dynamics have large influence on 
SOC responses to warming (high confidence) (Allison et  al. 2010; 
Frey et al. 2013; Wieder, William R., Bonan, Gordon B., Allison 2013; 
García-Palacios et al. 2015). More complex community interactions 
including competitive and trophic interactions could drive unexpected 
responses to SOC cycling to changes in temperature, moisture 
and carbon inputs (Crowther et al. 2015; Buchkowski et al. 2017). 
Competition for nitrogen among bacteria and fungi could also 
suppress decomposition (Averill et al. 2014). Overall, the roles of soil 
microbial community and trophic dynamics in global SOC cycling 
remain very uncertain.
2.7.6 
Soil carbon responses to changes 
in organic matter inputs by plants
While current ESM structures mean that increasing carbon inputs to 
soils drive corresponding increases in SOC stocks, long-term carbon 
addition experiments have found contradictory SOC responses. Some 
litter addition experiments have observed increased SOC accumulation 
(Lajtha et al. 2014b; Liu et al. 2009), while others suggest insignificant 
SOC responses (Lajtha et  al. 2014a; van Groenigen et  al. 2014). 
Microbial dynamics are believed to have an important role in driving 
complex responses to carbon additions. The addition of fresh organic 
material can accelerate microbial growth and SOM decomposition 
via priming effects (Kuzyakov et al. 2014; Cheng et al. 2017). SOM 
cycling is dominated by ‘hot spots’ including the rhizosphere as 
well as areas surrounding fresh detritus (medium evidence, high 
agreement) (Finzi et al. 2015; Kuzyakov and Blagodatskaya 2015). 
This complicates projections of SOC responses to increasing plant 
productivity as increasing carbon inputs could promote higher SOC 
storage, but these fresh carbon inputs could also deplete SOC stocks 
by promoting faster decomposition (Hopkins et al. 2014; Guenet et al. 
2018; Sulman et al. 2014). A meta-analysis by van Groenigen et al. 
(2014) suggested that elevated CO2 accelerated SOC turnover rates 
across several biomes. These effects could be especially important in 
high-latitude regions where soils have high organic matter content 
and plant productivity is increasing (Hartley et al. 2012), but have 
also been observed in the tropics (Sayer et al. 2011).
Along with biological decomposition, another source of uncertainty 
in projecting responses of SOC to climate change is stabilisation 
via interactions with mineral particles (high confidence) (Kögel-
Knabner et  al. 2008; Kleber et  al. 2011; Marschner et  al. 2008; 
Schmidt 2011). Historically, conceptual models of SOC cycling have 
centred on the role of chemical recalcitrance: the hypothesis that 
long-lived components of SOC are formed from organic compounds 
that are inherently resistant to decomposition. Under the emerging 
new paradigm, stable SOC is primarily formed by the bonding of 
microbially-processed organic material to mineral particles, which 
limits the accessibility of organic material to microbial decomposers 
(Lützow et al. 2006; Keiluweit et al. 2015; Kallenbach et al. 2016; 
Kleber et al. 2011; Hopkins et al. 2014). SOC in soil aggregates can 
be protected from microbial decomposition by being trapped in soil 
pores too small for microbes to access (Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2004; 
Six et al. 2004) or by oxygen limitation (Keiluweit et al. 2016). Some 
new models are integrating these mineral protection processes into 
SOC cycling projections (Wang et  al. 2017a; Sulman et  al. 2014; 
Riley  et  al. 2014; Wieder et  al. 2015), although the sensitivity of 
mineral-associated organic matter to changes in temperature, 
moisture, fire (Box 2.1) and carbon inputs is highly uncertain. 
Improved quantitative understanding of soil ecosystem processes 
will be critically important for projection of future land–climate 
feedback interactions.

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 2.1 | 
How does climate change affect land use and land cover?
Contemporary land cover and land use is adapted to current climate variability within particular temperature and/or rainfall ranges 
(referred to as climate envelopes). Anthropogenic GHG emissions impact land through changes in the weather and climate and 
also through modifications in atmospheric composition through increased GHGs, especially CO2. A warming climate alters the 
current regional climate variability and results in a shift of regional climate envelopes poleward and to higher elevations. The shift 
of warmer climate envelopes into high latitude areas has potential benefits for agriculture here through extended growing seasons, 
warmer seasonal temperatures and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations which enhance photosynthetic activity. However, 
this warming will also lead to enhanced snowmelt and reduced albedo, permafrost melting and the further release of CH4 and CO2 
into the atmosphere as the permafrost begins to decompose. Concurrent with these climate envelope shifts will be the emergence 
of new, hot climates in the tropics and increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of extreme events (e.g., heatwaves, very 
heavy rainfall, drought). These emergent hot climates will negatively affect land use (through changes in crop productivity, irrigation 
needs and management practices) and land cover through loss of vegetation productivity in many parts of the world, and would 
overwhelm any benefits to land use and land cover derived from increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
FAQ 2.2 | 
How do the land and land use contribute to climate change?
Any changes to the land and how it is used can effect exchanges of water, energy, GHGs (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O), non-GHGs (e.g., BVOCs) 
and aerosols (mineral, e.g., dust, or carbonaceous, e.g., BC) between the land and the atmosphere. Land and land use change therefore 
alter the state (e.g., chemical composition and air quality, temperature and humidity) and the dynamics (e.g., strength of horizontal and 
vertical winds) of the atmosphere, which, in turn, can dampen or amplify local climate change. Land-induced changes in energy, moisture 
and wind can affect neighbouring, and sometimes more distant, areas. For example, deforestation in Brazil warms the surface, in addition 
to global warming, and enhances convection which increases the relative temperature difference between the land and the ocean, 
boosting moisture advection from the ocean and thus rainfall further inland. Vegetation absorbs CO2 to use for growth and maintenance. 
Forests contain more carbon in their biomass and soils than croplands and so a conversion of forest to cropland, for example, results in 
emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere, thereby enhancing the GHG-induced global warming. Terrestrial ecosystems are both sources and 
sinks of chemical compounds such as nitrogen and ozone. BVOCs contribute to forming tropospheric ozone and secondary aerosols, 
which respectively effect surface warming and cloud formation. Semi-arid and arid regions release dust, as do cropland areas after 
harvest. Increasing the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere impacts temperature in both positive and negative ways depending on the 
particle size, altitude and nature (carbonaceous or mineral, for example). Although global warming will impact the functioning and state 
of the land (FAQ 2.1), this is not a one-way interaction as changes in land and land use can also affect climate and thus modulate climate 
change. Understanding this two-way interaction can help improve adaptation and mitigation strategies, as well as manage landscapes.
FAQ 2.3 | 
How does climate change affect water resources?
Renewable freshwater resources are essential for the survival of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and for human use in agriculture, 
industry and in domestic contexts. As increased water vapour concentrations are expected in a warmer atmosphere, climate change 
will alter the hydrological cycle and therefore regional freshwater resources. In general, wet regions are projected to get wetter and 
dry regions drier, although there are regional exceptions to this. The consequent impacts vary regionally; where rainfall is projected 
to be lower in the future (many arid subtropical regions and those with a Mediterranean climate), a reduction of water resources 
is expected. Here increased temperatures and decreased rainfall will reduce surface and groundwater resources, increase plant 
evapotranspiration and increase evaporation rates from open water (rivers, lakes, wetlands) and water supply infrastructure (canals, 
reservoirs). In regions where rainfall is projected to be higher in the future (many high latitude regions and the wet tropics), an 
increase in water resources can be expected to benefit terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, agriculture and domestic use, however, 
these benefits may be limited due to increased temperatures. An increase in extreme rainfall events is also expected which will 
lead to increases in surface runoff, regional flooding and nutrient removal as well as a reduction in soil water and groundwater 
recharge in many places. Anthropogenic land use change may amplify or moderate the climate change effect on water resources, 
therefore informed land management strategies need to be developed. A warming climate will exacerbate the existing pressures 
on renewable freshwater resources in water-stressed regions of the Earth and result in increased competition for water between 
human and natural systems.

Appendix
This appendix provides all numbers that support Figures 2.14 and 
2.17 located in Section 2.5. It lists all model-based studies, with their 
references, that have been used to create the figures. Studies that 
examine the effects of historical and future scenarios of changes in 
anthropogenic land cover are presented in Table A2.1. The responses 
to idealised latitudinal deforestation and forestation can be found in 
Table A2.2. 
The biophysical effects of changes in anthropogenic land 
cover reflect the impacts of changes in physical land surface 
characteristics such as albedo, evapotranspiration, and roughness 
length. The biogeochemical effects reflect changes in atmospheric 
CO2 composition resulting from anthropogenic changes in land 
cover. The biogeochemical effects are estimated using three 
different methods:
1. Directly calculated within global climate models (Tables A2.1 
and A2.2),
2. Calculated from off-line dynamic global vegetation models 
(DGVMs) estimates of net changes in the emissions of CO2 from 
land (Table A2.1),
9 
Land-use change + fossil fuel emission simulation values are considered.
10 
Carbon-nitrogen-phosphorous simulation values are considered.
3. Calculated from observation-based estimates of net changes in 
the emissions of CO2 from land (for historical reconstruction only, 
Table A2.1).
The mean annual and global temperature change (∆T) resulting from 
biogeochemical effects is calculated as follows, for both DGMVs and 
observation-based estimates:
∆T = ∆LCO2 × TCRE
Where ∆LCO2 is the cumulative changes in net emissions of CO2 
resulting from anthropogenic land cover changes during the time 
period considered (in Tera tons of carbon, TtC), and TCRE is the 
transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (Gillett 
et al. 2013; Matthews et al. 2009). TCRE is a measure of the global 
temperature response to cumulative emissions of CO2 and has been 
identified as a useful and practical tool for evaluating CO2-induced 
climate changes (expressed in °C per Tera tons of carbon, °C/TtC). 
TCRE values have been estimated for a range of Earth system models 
(Gillett et al. 2013; MacDougall et al. 2016). In the following, we 
use the 5th percentile, mean and 95th percentile derived from the 
range of available TCRE values. For each DGVM or observation-based 
estimate, we then calculate three potential temperature changes to 
bracket the range of climate sensitivities. 
Table A2.1 |   Model-based and observation-based estimates of the effects historical and future anthropogenic land cover changes have on mean 
annual global surface air temperature (°C). BGC and BPH correspond to the change in temperature resulting from respectively biogeochemical processes 
(e.g., changes in atmospheric CO2 composition) and biophysical processes (e.g., changes in physical land surface characteristics such as albedo, evapotranspiration, 
and roughness length).
