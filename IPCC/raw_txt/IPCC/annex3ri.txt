ANNEX 3
SUMMARY OF THE REVISED 1996
IPCC 
GUIDELINES 
FOR
NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS
INVENTORIES
A3.1 Background
This Annex summarises additions and revisions to the 1995 IPCC Guidelines
for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (1995 IPCC Guidelines). It also
describes efforts made by the IPCC to harmonise methods with others.
The additions and revisions were accepted by the IPCC at its Twelfth
Session held in Mexico City (11-13 September 1996) after acceptance by
Working Group I at its Sixth Session held in Mexico City (10 September
1996) in accordance with IPCC procedures.  They are called the Revised
1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. Within this
Annex, a revision of an existing methodology or default data is referred to
as a ‘revision’, ‘revised method’ or ‘revised data’.  Additional methods and
default data are defined as ‘new’ methods or ‘new data’.
A3.2 Energy
The Energy Chapter contains the following improvements and additions:
• 
Harmonisation of international (IPCC and CORINAIR) emission
estimation methodologies and allocating of emissions from
autoproducers1 to the sector where they are generated and not to
the transformation2 sector (revision);
• 
Development of a new Tier 1 method for estimating non-CO2
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and SO2 emissions based on fuel
consumption;
• 
Development of a new Tier 2 method for estimating emissions from
aircraft;
• 
Inclusion of new default values for various types of traditional
biomass fuels;
• 
Clarification of the definition of National Navigation (the definition of
International Marine Bunkers remains unchanged).
                                                  
     1 An autoproducer is defined as an entity which produces electricity
and/or heat for sale in addition to its primary activities.
     2 The transformation sector comprises the conversion of primary forms
of energy to secondary and further transformation (e.g. coking coal to coke,
heavy fuel oil to electricity)

A3.3 Industrial Processes
The Industrial Process Chapter contains a broad range of new estimation
methodologies for the so-called "new gases", that is perfluorocarbons, PFCs
(e.g. CF4 and C2F6), HFCs (e.g. HFC-125 and HFC-134a), sulphur
hexafluoride (SF6), the direct GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O), and ozone and
aerosol precursors (SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC) from industrial, non-energy,
processes.
Direct GHG: The new methodologies cover CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions
from the production of mineral compounds, chemical industries and metal
manufacture. The estimation of CO2 emissions from cement production
remains unchanged, but the methodologies for N2O emissions from nitric
and adipic acid production have been revised.
Aerosol and ozone precursors: For SO2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, new
methodologies are presented, which draw upon and improve existing
international methodologies. The sectors covered are: mineral compounds
production, chemical industries and metal manufacture.
Fluorocarbons and SF6: For HFCs and PFCs, and SF6, methodologies are
provided to estimate by-product and fugitive emissions from aluminium (Al)
and magnesium (Mg) manufacturing processes, as well as emissions from
their production and consumption. Two approaches are given: Tier 1 (a, b)
for potential emissions, and Tier 2, for actual emissions. Potential emissions of
PFCs, HFCs, and SF6: are equal to the amount of a chemical consumed in a
country, minus the amount of a chemical recovered for destruction or
export in the year of consideration. Actual emissions estimates take into
account the time lag between consumption and emissions. The Tier 2
methodology is, therefore, the more accurate estimation approach.
A3.4 Land-use Change and Forestry
Several revisions to the methods for the Land-use Change and Forestry
Chapter are provided. One such revision is to the method for estimating
CO2 fluxes from soils, as described below.
The revisions to the Land-use Change and Forestry Chapter greatly extend
and improve the range and quality of default data, particularly for the
tropics, where national forestry statistics are sometimes less accessible than
in the temperate or boreal regions. The revisions can be summarised by
changes in (a) default data and in (b) methods, as follows:
D e f a u l t  d a t a
Classification system for land cover types: A revised system more
consistent with sources of national, regional and international data, such as
forest conversion rates and forest inventories was developed. The revised
classification system better reflects the diversity of forest types. For the
tropics, three classes of forests have been replaced with six, based on
differences in rainfall amount, seasonality, and altitude.
Rates of forest conversion: New FAO default data are provided for each
country and forest type according to the proposed land-cover classification

system. These data have been compiled for the tropics for the 1980-90
period. Such revisions were incorporated because country-level data are
often difficult to obtain for many tropical countries; the 1995 IPCC
Guidelines contain no such data.
Aboveground biomass for native tropical forests: Emissions estimates
from land-use change and forestry can be highly sensitive to such input data
and therefore a priority was given to improving aboveground biomass data.
Since publication of the 1995 IPCC Guidelines, better datasets have become
available drawing upon larger regional studies. The revisions now include a
large database of default values for Africa, America, and Asia for the revised
land-cover classification system. Additional data based on individual forest
inventories (suitable for converting to biomass) for many tropical countries
are also included. None of the default values are separated into primary and
secondary forests (as in 1995 IPCC Guidelines) because it was felt by
experts that this was not a practical classification, given the variability of
definitions in different regions.
Rates of tropical forest regrowth: Revised default data are given for forest
regrowth; the data are related to the biomass data and are reported for the
three tropical regions by forest type, according to the revised classification
system.
M e t h o d s
Estimation of net CO2 emissions from soil carbon: In the 1995 IPCC
Guidelines, CO2 estimates are based upon the product of the rate of change
in area of a given land-use and the rate of change of soil carbon. The revised
method estimates changes in soil carbon pools associated with altered land-
use or land management practices. Thus, all categories of agriculturally-
impacted lands, including conversions of forest or other vegetation to
agriculture, land abandonment, shifting cultivation and permanent
agriculture, are included in the methodology. A default stock method is
employed to estimate CO2 fluxes associated with agricultural activities for a
20-year inventory period. This area of the IPCC Methodology has been
much improved because better scientific data is now available. The revised
method is more compatible with potential policy analysis.
A3.5 Agriculture
Three sections of this Chapter have been revised, that are, (1) methane
emissions from rice cultivation, (2) nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural
soils and (3) manure management. For the estimation of N2O emissions,
the default methods and data are new.
M e t h a n e  E m i s s i o n s  f r o m  R i c e  C u l t i v a t i o n
In the 1995 IPCC Guidelines, the estimation of CH4 emissions from wetland
rice cultivation is a function of the CH4 emission factor, area of rice
cultivated and the season length. One critical default parameter is the CH4
emission factor, which is based upon temperature. It was determined that
the relationship between CH4 emissions and soil temperature as assumed in
SUMMARY
A3.4
R e v i se d  1 9 9 6  I P C C  G u i d e l i n e s fo r  N a t i o n a l  G r e e n h o u se  G a s I n v e n t o r i e s:   R e p o r t i n g  I n st r u c t i o n s
the 1995 IPCC Guidelines was no longer appropriate because new data
suggest that the seasonally integrated CH4 flux depends much more on the
input of organic carbon, water regime, time and duration of drainage and
soil type than on local temperature. The revised methodology is a function
of the emission factor integrated over a cropping season for particular rice
water regime, for a given organic amendment, and of the annual harvested
area cultivated under these conditions. The latter is given by the cultivated
area times the number of cropping seasons per year.
The revisions to the method use internationally-agreed definitions for rice
eco-systems classified according to the water regime and a range of CH4
emission scaling factors relative to continuously flooded rice eco-systems
and for soils without organic amendment. A default seasonally integrated
emission factor is also provided for the continuously-flooded regime,
without-organic amendment.
Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Agricultural
Soils and Manure Management
A new default method for calculating national emissions of N2O from
agriculture is provided. The new N2O method is a revision of the method in
the 1995 IPCC Guidelines. It includes more sources of N2O from agricultural
activities and makes explicit recommendations on N2O emission factors.
The new method accounts for the application of N-fertilisers to the soil and
N uptake in crops and subsequently tracks the flow of N as it moves
through the (anthropogenic) animal and human food chain. Three
categories of N2O sources are distinguished in the new methodology, (1)
direct emissions from agricultural soils, (2) emissions from animal
production, and (3) N2O emissions indirectly induced by agricultural
activities3.  Because a larger number of sources and pathways are
considered, the new N2O methodology affects several source sectors.
Emissions are reported in several sections of the 1995 IPCC Guidelines,
namely, Manure Management (Section 4.2, 1995 IPCC Guidelines),
Agricultural Soils (Section 4.5, 1995 IPCC Guidelines), and Waste (Section
6.3, 1995 IPCC Guidelines). The input data required can be obtained from
FAO databases.
The new method provides a comprehensive description of N2O emissions
from agriculturally-related activities by accounting for previously omitted
N2O sources. Using this method, global N2O emission estimates imply that
atmospheric N2O input from agricultural production as a whole has
apparently been previously underestimated by at least 70%. Nitrous oxide
emissions resulting from atmospheric deposition are assigned to the NOx
or NH3 emitting country4.
                                                  
     3 It is however recognised that there are other sources of
anthropogenic atmospheric inputs of N-compounds to soils e.g., NOx from
fuel combustion.  Only compounds directly applied to agricultural soils are
considered.
     4 In some countries and regions, other conventions related to long
range transboundary air pollution are addressing the issue of atmospheric
transport and deposition in greater detail.

A3.5
A3.6 Waste
The Chapter on Waste addresses various topics, including: improved waste
disposal data, evaluation of the methodologies for solid waste and
wastewater, definitions of activities and uncertainties of CH4 emission
estimates. The main improvements to the methods and default data are as
follows:
S o l i d  W a s t e
Site classification: A new term - solid waste disposal site - has been
proposed to refer to all sites and to replace the terminology in 1995 IPCC
Guidelines for ‘landfills’ and ‘open dumps’. The new term was proposed
because experience suggests that the existing categories do not adequately
include the entire range of waste disposal sites that exists in all countries.
Solid waste disposal sites include all sites where waste is deposited and is
likely to generate some methane. Sites are further classified according to
the level of site management and depth.
Methane correction factor: The new site classification is used to derive a
methane correction factor (MCF) to account for the methane generation
potential of the site. The amount of methane produced depends in part
upon the available oxygen and the level of compaction of the waste. In
general, waste in managed sites potentially generates more methane than
waste in unmanaged sites. Furthermore, the deeper the site, the greater the
methane generation potential. The methane correction factor for each type
of site reflects these differences in methane generation potential. The site
classification recognises that some developing countries, or countries with-
economies-in-transition, may have a majority of less-well managed or
unmanaged sites, often with a lower methane-producing potential than well
managed sites.
Waste data: A wide range of revised and new default data on waste
generation, composition and disposal data in many additional developed and
developing countries is provided. A definition for Municipal Solid Waste and
a method for calculating the Degradable Organic Carbon content of various
waste streams are now included in the revised Chapter.
Methodology: The default methodology was evaluated and retained. The
methodology uses a zero-order equation requiring data on population,
waste landfills, and waste composition as proposed by Bingemar and
Crutzen (1987).
W a s t e w a t e r
A revised method and default data for calculating emissions from wastewater
and sludge is included. The amount of CH4 produced from these systems
depends upon several factors, including the characteristics of the
wastewater and the management system, and temperature. These factors
are highly dependent upon the waste treatment system used. The revised
methodology allows countries to tailor the estimation approaches more
precisely to their wastewater management systems. This is accomplished by
the MCF that accounts for the differing CH4 generating potential of

different wastewater management systems. In addition, the revised
methodology uses data that is commonly available from most countries, or
which can be estimated by wastewater experts.
H u m a n  s e w a g e
A new methodology and default data are provided for the estimation of
N2O nitrous oxide emissions from human sewage disposed to land, and in
subsequent run-off to rivers and estuaries. There is no such methodology in
1995 IPCC Guidelines.
A3.7 Harmonisation of International
Emission Estimation Methodologies
Progress has been made in the harmonisation of the IPCC and
EMEP/CORINAIR methodologies to allow more direct comparison of the
two approaches. These changes are mainly in the Energy Chapter, but
harmonisation was a theme in all other chapters, including Industrial
Processes. Examples of harmonisation are given below from the Energy
Chapter:
• 
Biomass fuels are allocated to the various source categories (new). As
in 1995 IPCC Guidelines, CO2 from biomass will not be reported in
national totals as this is captured in the Land-use Change and
Forestry Chapter
• 
Emissions from fuel used for electricity and heat production by
autoproducers will be included in the sector where it is generated
and not with the transformation industries.
• 
Treatment of evaporative emissions (NMVOCs) from road transport
in the Tier 2 method of IPCC is made consistent with CORINAIR.
Combustion and evaporative emissions are to be reported
separately. However, in the new Tier I IPCC method, all emissions
from road transport are included together under fuel combustion.
• 
Development of a new Tier 2 method for estimating emissions from
aircraft.
