Executive Summary
The ocean is essential for all aspects of human well-being and 
livelihood. It provides key services like climate regulation, through 
the energy budget, carbon cycle and nutrient cycle. The ocean is the 
home of biodiversity ranging from microbes to marine mammals 
that form a wide variety of ecosystems in open pelagic and 
coastal ocean.
Observations: Climate-related trends, impacts, adaptation
Carbon emissions from human activities are causing ocean 
warming, acidiﬁcation and oxygen loss with some evidence 
of changes in nutrient cycling and primary production. The 
warming ocean is affecting marine organisms at multiple 
trophic levels, impacting ﬁsheries with implications for food 
production and human communities. Concerns regarding the 
effectiveness of existing ocean and ﬁsheries governance 
have already been reported, highlighting the need for timely 
mitigation and adaptation responses.
The ocean has warmed unabated since 2005, continuing the 
clear multi-decadal ocean warming trends documented in 
the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). The warming trend is 
further conﬁrmed by the improved ocean temperature measurements 
over the last decade. The 0−700 m and 700–2000 m layers of the 
ocean have warmed at rates of 5.31 ± 0.48 and 4.02 ± 0.97 ZJ yr–1 
from 2005 to 2017. The long-term trend for 0–700 m and 700–2000 m 
layers have warmed 4.35 ± 0.8 and 2.25 ± 0.64 ZJ yr–1 from between 
the averages of 1971–1990 and 1998–2017 and is attributed 
to anthropogenic inﬂuences. It is likely1 the ocean warming has 
continued in the abyssal and deep ocean below 2000 m (southern 
hemisphere and Southern Ocean). {1.8.1, 1.2, 5.2.2}
It is likely that the rate of ocean warming has increased since 
1993. The 0−700 m and 700–2000 m layers of the ocean have 
warmed by 3.22 ± 1.61 ZJ and 0.97 ± 0.64 ZJ from 1969 to 1993, and 
6.28 ± 0.48 ZJ and 3.86 ± 2.09 ZJ from 1993 to 2017. This represents 
at least a two-fold increase in heat uptake. {Table 5.1, 5.2.2}
The upper ocean is very likely to have been stratifying since 
1970. Observed warming and high-latitude freshening are making 
the surface ocean less dense over time relative to the deeper ocean 
(high conﬁdence2) and inhibiting the exchange between surface and 
deep waters. The upper 200 m stratiﬁcation increase is in the very 
likely range of between 2.18−2.42% from 1970 to 2017. {5.2.2}

In this Report, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain 99–100% probability, Very likely 90–100%, 
Likely 66–100%, About as likely as not 33–66%, Unlikely 0–33%, Very unlikely 0–10%, and Exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms (Extremely likely: 95–100%, More 
likely than not >50–100%, and Extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely (see Section 1.9.2 and 
Figure 1.4 for more details). This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood of an outcome lies within the 17–83% probability range.
2 
In this Report, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. 
A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium conﬁdence. For a given evidence and 
agreement statement, different conﬁdence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing conﬁdence 
(see Section 1.9.2 and Figure 1.4 for more details).
Multiple datasets and models show that the rate of ocean 
uptake of atmospheric CO2 has continued to strengthen 
in the recent two decades in response to the increasing 
concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. The very likely range 
for ocean uptake is between 20–30% of total anthropogenic 
emissions in the recent two decades. Evidence is growing that the 
ocean carbon sink is dynamic on decadal timescales, especially 
in the Southern Ocean, which has affected the total global ocean 
carbon sink (medium conﬁdence). {5.2.2.3}
The ocean is continuing to acidify in response to ongoing ocean 
carbon uptake. The open ocean surface water pH is observed to be 
declining (virtually certain) by a very likely range of 0.017−0.027 pH 
units per decade since the late 1980s across individual time series 
observations longer than 15 years. The anthropogenic pH signal is very 
likely to have emerged for three-quarters of the near-surface open 
ocean prior to 1950 and it is very likely that over 95% of the near 
surface open ocean has already been affected. These changes in pH 
have reduced the stability of mineral forms of calcium carbonate due 
to a lowering of carbonate ion concentrations, most notably in the 
upwelling and high-latitude regions of the ocean. {5.2.2.3, Box 5.1}
There is a growing consensus that the open ocean is losing 
oxygen overall with a very likely loss of 0.5−3.3% between 
1970–2010 from the ocean surface to 1000  m (medium 
conﬁdence). Globally, the oxygen loss due to warming is reinforced by 
other processes associated with ocean physics and biogeochemistry, 
which cause the majority of the observed oxygen decline (high 
conﬁdence). The oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are expanding by 
a very likely range of 3–8%, most notably in the tropical oceans, but 
there is substantial decadal variability that affects the attribution 
of the overall oxygen declines to human activity in tropical regions 
(high conﬁdence). {5.2.2.4}
In response to ocean warming and increased stratiﬁcation, 
open ocean nutrient cycles are being perturbed and there 
is high conﬁdence that this is having a regionally variable 
impact on primary producers. There is currently low conﬁdence 
in appraising past open ocean productivity trends, including those 
determined by satellites, due to newly identiﬁed region-speciﬁc 
drivers of microbial growth and the lack of corroborating in situ time 
series datasets. {5.2.2.5, 5.2.2.6}
Ocean warming has contributed to observed changes in 
biogeography of organisms ranging from phytoplankton to 
marine mammals (high conﬁdence), consequently changing 
community composition (high conﬁdence), and in some 
cases, altering interactions between organisms (medium 
conﬁdence). Observed rate of range shifts since the 1950s and its 
451

very likely range are estimated to be 51.5 ± 33.3 km per decade 
and 29.0 ± 15.5 km per decade for organisms in the epipelagic and 
seaﬂoor ecosystems, respectively. The direction of the majority of 
the shifts of epipelagic organisms are consistent with a response to 
warming (high conﬁdence). {5.2.3, 5.3}
Warming-induced range expansion of tropical species to higher 
latitudes has led to increased grazing on some coral reefs, rocky 
reefs, seagrass meadows and epipelagic ecosystems, leading 
to altered ecosystem structure (medium conﬁdence). Warming, 
sea level rise (SLR) and enhanced loads of nutrients and sediments in 
deltas have contributed to salinisation and deoxygenation in estuaries 
(high conﬁdence), and have caused upstream redistribution of benthic 
and pelagic species according to their tolerance limits (medium 
conﬁdence). {5.3.4, 5.3.5, 5.3.6, 5.2.3}
Fisheries catches and their composition in many regions are 
already impacted by the effects of warming and changing 
primary production on growth, reproduction and survival of ﬁsh 
stocks (high conﬁdence). Ocean warming and changes in primary 
production since the 20th century are related to changes in productivity 
of many ﬁsh stocks (high conﬁdence), with an average decrease of 
approximately 3% per decade in population replenishment and 4.1% 
(very likely range of 9.0% decline to 0.3% increase) in maximum 
catch potential (robust evidence, low agreement between ﬁsh stocks, 
medium conﬁdence). Species composition of ﬁsheries catches since 
the 1970s in many shelf seas ecosystems of the world is increasingly 
dominated by warm water species (medium conﬁdence). {5.2.3, 5.4.1}
Warming-induced changes in spatial distribution and abundance 
of ﬁsh stocks have already challenged the management of 
some important ﬁsheries and their economic beneﬁts (high 
conﬁdence). For existing international and national ocean and ﬁsheries 
governance, there are concerns about the reduced effectiveness to 
achieve mandated ecological, economic, and social objectives because 
of observed climate impacts on ﬁsheries resources (high conﬁdence). 
{5.4.2, 5.5.2}
Coastal ecosystems are observed to be under stress from 
ocean warming and SLR that are exacerbated by non-climatic 
pressures from human activities on ocean and land (high 
conﬁdence). Global wetland area has declined by nearly 50% 
relative to pre-industrial level as a result of warming, SLR, extreme 
climate events and other human impacts (medium conﬁdence). 
Warming related mangrove encroachment into subtropical salt 
marshes has been observed in the past 50 years (high conﬁdence). 
Distributions of seagrass meadows and kelp forests are contracting 
at low-latitudes that is attributable to warming (high conﬁdence), 
and in some areas a loss of 36–43% following heat waves (medium 
conﬁdence). Inundation, coastline erosion and salinisation are 
causing inland shifts in plant species distributions, which has been 
accelerating in the last decades (medium conﬁdence). Warming has 
increased the frequency of large-scale coral bleaching events, causing 
worldwide reef degradation since 1997–1998 with cases of shifts to 
algal-dominated reefs (high conﬁdence). Sessile calciﬁed organisms 
(e.g.,  barnacles and mussels) in intertidal rocky shores are highly 
sensitive to extreme temperature events and acidiﬁcation (high 
conﬁdence), a reduction in their biodiversity and abundance have 
been observed in naturally-acidiﬁed rocky reef ecosystems (medium 
conﬁdence). Increased nutrient and organic matter loads in estuaries 
since the 1970s have exacerbated the effects of warming on bacterial 
respiration and eutrophication, leading to expansion of hypoxic areas 
(high conﬁdence). {5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.4, 5.3.6}
Coastal and near-shore ecosystems including salt marshes, 
mangrove forests and vegetated dunes in sandy beaches have 
a varying capacity to build vertically and expand laterally in 
response to SLR. These ecosystems provide important services 
including coastal protection, carbon sequestration and habitat for 
diverse biota (high conﬁdence). The carbon emission associated 
with the loss of vegetated coastal ecosystems is estimated to be 
0.04–1.46  Gt C yr–1 (high conﬁdence). The natural capacity of 
ecosystems to adapt to climate impacts may be limited by human 
activities that fragment wetland habitats and restrict landward 
migration (high conﬁdence). {5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.4.1, 5.5.1}
Three out of the four major Eastern Boundary Upwelling 
Systems (EBUS) have shown large-scale wind intensiﬁcation 
in the past 60 years (high conﬁdence). However, the interaction 
of coastal warming and local winds may have affected upwelling 
strength, with the direction of changes varies between and within 
EBUS (low conﬁdence). Increasing trends in ocean acidiﬁcation in 
the California Current EBUS and deoxygenation in California Current 
and Humboldt Current EBUS are observed in the last few decades 
(high conﬁdence), although there is low conﬁdence to distinguish 
anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. The expanding 
California EBUS OMZ has altered ecosystem structure and ﬁsheries 
catches (medium conﬁdence). {Box 5.3}
Since the early 1980s, the occurrence of harmful algal blooms 
(HABs) and pathogenic organisms (e.g.,  Vibrio) has increased 
in coastal areas in response to warming, deoxygenation and 
eutrophication, with negative impacts on food provisioning, 
tourism, the economy and human health (high conﬁdence). These 
impacts depend on species-speciﬁc responses to the interactive effects 
of climate change and other human drivers (e.g., pollution). Human 
communities in poorly monitored areas are among the most vulnerable 
to these biological hazards (medium conﬁdence). {Box 5.4, 5.4.2}
Many frameworks for climate resilient coastal adaptation 
have been developed since AR5, with substantial variations 
in approach between and within countries, and across 
development status (high conﬁdence). Few studies have assessed 
the success of implementing these frameworks due to the time-lag 
between implementation, monitoring, evaluation and reporting 
(medium conﬁdence). {5.5.2}
Projections: scenarios and time horizons
Climate models project signiﬁcant changes in the ocean state 
over the coming century. Under the high emissions scenario 
(Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5) the impacts 
by 2090 are substantially larger and more widespread than for 
452
Chapter 5 
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

the low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) throughout the surface 
and deep ocean, including: warming (virtually certain); ocean 
acidiﬁcation (virtually certain); decreased stability of mineral 
forms of calcite (virtually certain); oxygen loss (very likely); 
reduced near-surface nutrients (likely as not); decreased net 
primary productivity (high conﬁdence); reduced ﬁsh production 
(likely) and loss of key ecosystems services (medium conﬁdence) 
that are important for human well-being and sustainable 
development. {5.2.2, Box 5.1, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.4}
By 2100 the ocean is very likely to warm by 2 to 4 times as much 
for low emissions (RCP2.6) and 5 to 7 times as much for the 
high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) compared with the observed 
changes since 1970. The 0–2000 m layer of the ocean is projected to 
warm by a further 2150 ZJ (very likely range 1710–2790 ZJ) between 
2017 and 2100 for the RCP8.5 scenario. The 0–2000 m layer is 
projected to warm by 900 ZJ (very likely range 650–1340 ZJ) by 2100 
for the RCP2.6 scenario, and the overall warming of the ocean will 
continue this century even after radiative forcing and mean surface 
temperatures stabilise (high conﬁdence). {5.2.2.2}
The upper ocean will continue to stratify. By the end of the 
century the annual mean stratiﬁcation of the top 200 m (averaged 
between 60ºS–60ºN relative to the 1986–2005 period) is projected 
to increase in the very likely range of 1–9% and 12–30% for RCP2.6 
and RCP8.5 respectively. {5.2.2.2}
It is very likely that the majority of coastal regions will 
experience statistically signiﬁcant changes in tidal amplitudes 
over the course of the 21st century. The sign and amplitude of 
local changes to tides are very likely to be impacted by both human 
coastal adaptation measures and climate drivers. {5.2.2.2.3}
It is virtually certain that surface ocean pH will decline, by 
0.036–0.042 or 0.287–0.29 pH units by 2081–2100, relative to 
2006–2015, for the RCP2.6 or RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. 
These pH changes are very likely to cause the Arctic and Southern 
Oceans, as well as the North Paciﬁc and Northwestern Atlantic 
Oceans to become corrosive for the major mineral forms of calcium 
carbonate under RCP8.5, but these changes are virtually certain to 
be avoided under the RCP2.6 scenario. There is increasing evidence 
of an increase in the seasonal exposure to acidiﬁed conditions in the 
future (high conﬁdence), with a very likely increase in the amplitude 
of seasonal cycle of hydrogen iron concentrations of 71–90% by 
2100, relative to 2000 for the RCP8.5 scenario, especially at high 
latitudes. {5.2.2.3}
Oxygen is projected to decline further. Globally, the oxygen 
content of the ocean is very likely to decline by 3.2–3.7% by 
2081–2100, relative to 2006–2015, for the RCP8.5 scenario or by 
1.6–2.0% for the RCP2.6 scenario. The volume of the oceans OMZ 
is projected to grow by a very likely range of 7.0 ± 5.6% by 2100 
during the RCP8.5 scenario, relative to 1850–1900. The climate 
signal of oxygen loss will very likely emerge from the historical 
climate by 2050 with a very likely range of 59–80% of ocean area 
being affected by 2031–2050 and rising with a very likely range 
of 79–91% by 2081–2100 (RCP8.5). The emergence of oxygen 
loss is very likely smaller in area for the RCP2.6 scenario in the 
21st century and by 2090 the emerged area is declining. {5.2.2.4, 
Box 5.1 Figure 1}
Overall, nitrate concentrations in the upper 100 m are very 
likely to decline by 9–14% across CMIP5 models by 2081–2100, 
relative to 2006–2015, in response to increased stratiﬁcation 
for RCP8.5, with medium conﬁdence in these projections due 
to the limited evidence of past changes that can be robustly 
understood and reproduced by models. There is low conﬁdence 
regarding projected increases in surface ocean iron levels due to 
systemic uncertainties in these models. {5.2.2.5}
Climate models project that net primary productivity will very 
likely decline by 4–11% for RCP8.5 by 2081–2100, relative to 
2006–2015. The decline is due to the combined effects of warming, 
stratiﬁcation, light, nutrients and predation and will show regional 
variations between low and high latitudes (low conﬁdence). The 
tropical ocean NPP will very likely decline by 7–16% for RCP8.5, with 
medium conﬁdence as there are improved constraints from historical 
variability in this region. Globally, the sinking ﬂux of organic matter 
from the upper ocean into the ocean interior is very likely to decrease 
by 9–16% for RCP8.5 in response to increased stratiﬁcation and 
reduced nutrient supply, especially in tropical regions (medium 
conﬁdence), which will reduce organic carbon supply to deep sea 
ecosystems (high conﬁdence). The reduction in food supply to the 
deep sea is projected to lead to a 5–6% reduction in biomass of 
benthic biota over more than 97% of the abyssal seaﬂoor by 2100 
(medium conﬁdence). {5.2.2.6, 5.2.4.2}
New ocean states for a broad suite of climate indices will 
progressively emerge over a substantial fractions of the 
ocean in the coming century (relative to past internal ocean 
variability), with Earth System Models (ESMs) showing an 
ordered emergence of ﬁrst pH, followed by sea surface 
temperature (SST), interior oxygen, upper ocean nutrient levels 
and ﬁnally net primary production (NPP). The anthropogenic pH 
signal has very likely emerged for three quarters of the ocean prior to 
1950, with little difference between scenarios. Oxygen changes will 
very likely emerge over 59–80% of the ocean area by 2031–2050 
and rises to 79–91% by 2081–2100 (RCP8.5). The projected time 
of emergence for ﬁve primary drivers of marine ecosystem change 
(surface warming and acidiﬁcation, oxygen loss, nitrate content and 
net primary production change) are all prior to 2100 for over 60% 
of the ocean area under RCP8.5 and over 30% under RCP2.6 (very 
likely). {Box 5.1, Box 5.1 Figure 1}
Simulated ocean warming and changes in NPP during the 21st 
century are projected to alter community structure of marine 
organisms (high conﬁdence), reduce global marine animal 
biomass (medium conﬁdence) and the maximum potential 
catches of ﬁsh stocks (medium conﬁdence) with regional 
differences in the direction and magnitude of changes (high 
conﬁdence). The global biomass of marine animals, including those 
that contribute to ﬁsheries, is projected to decrease with a very likely 
range under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 of 4.3 ± 2.0% and 15.0 ± 5.9%, 
respectively, by 2080–2099 relative to 1986–2005. The maximum 
453

catch potential is projected to decrease by 3.4% to 6.4% (RCP2.6) 
and 20.5% to 24.1% (RCP8.5) in the 21st century. {5.4.1}
Projected decreases in global marine animal biomass and 
ﬁsh catch potential could elevate the risk of impacts on 
income, livelihood and food security of the dependent human 
communities (medium conﬁdence). Projected climate change 
impacts on ﬁsheries also increase the risk of potential conﬂicts among 
ﬁshery area users and authorities or among different communities 
within the same country (medium conﬁdence), exacerbated through 
competing resource exploitation from international actors and 
mal-adapted policies (low conﬁdence). {5.2.3, 5.4, 5.5.3}
Projected decrease in upper ocean export of organic carbon 
to the deep seaﬂoor is expected to result in a loss of animal 
biomass on the deep seaﬂoor by 5.2–17.6% by 2090–2100 
compared to the present (2006–2015) under RCP8.5 with 
regional variations (medium conﬁdence). Some increases are 
projected in the polar regions, due to enhanced stratiﬁcation in 
the surface ocean, reduced primary production and shifts towards 
small phytoplankton (medium conﬁdence). The projected impacts on 
biomass in the abyssal seaﬂoor are larger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 
(very likely). The increase in climatic hazards beyond thresholds of 
tolerance of deep sea organisms will increase the risk of loss of 
biodiversity and impacts on functioning of deep water column and 
seaﬂoor that is important to support ecosystem services, such as 
carbon sequestration (medium conﬁdence). {5.2.4}
Structure and functions of all types of coastal ecosystems 
will continue to be at moderate to high risk under the 
RCP2.6 scenario (medium conﬁdence) and will face high to 
very high risk under the RCP8.5 scenario (high conﬁdence) 
by 2100. Seagrass meadows (high conﬁdence) and kelp forests 
(high conﬁdence) will face moderate to high risk at temperature 
above 1.5ºC global sea surface warming. Coral reefs will face very 
high risk at temperatures 1.5ºC of global sea surface warming 
(very high conﬁdence). Intertidal rocky shores are also expected 
to be at very high risk (transition above 3ºC) under the RCP8.5 
scenario (medium conﬁdence). These ecosystems have low to 
moderate adaptive capacity, as they are highly sensitive to ocean 
temperatures and acidiﬁcation. The ecosystems with moderate to 
high risk (transition above 1.8ºC) under future emissions scenarios 
are mangrove forests, sandy beaches, estuaries and salt marshes 
(medium conﬁdence). Estuaries and sandy beaches are subject 
to highly dynamic hydrological and geomorphological processes, 
giving them more natural adaptive capacity to climate hazards. In 
these systems, sediment relocation, soil accretion and landward 
expansion of vegetation may initially mitigate against ﬂooding and 
habitat loss, but salt marshes in particular will be at very high risk 
in the context of SLR and extreme climate-driven erosion under 
RCP8.5. {5.3, Figure 5.16}
Expected coastal ecosystem responses over the 21st century 
are habitat contraction, migration and loss of biodiversity 
and functionality. Pervasive human coastal disturbances will limit 
natural ecosystem adaptation to climate hazards (high conﬁdence). 
Global coastal wetlands will lose between 20–90% of their area 
depending on emissions scenario with impacts on their contributions 
to carbon sequestration and coastal protection (high conﬁdence). 
Kelp forests at low-latitudes and temperate seagrass meadows will 
continue to retreat as a result of intensiﬁed extreme temperatures, 
and their low dispersal ability will elevate the risk of local extinction 
under RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence). Intertidal rocky shores will continue 
to be affected by ocean acidiﬁcation, warming, and extreme heat 
exposure during low tide emersion, causing reduction of calcareous 
species and loss of ecosystem biodiversity and complexity shifting 
towards algae dominated habitats (high conﬁdence). Salinisation and 
expansion of hypoxic conditions will intensify in eutrophic estuaries, 
especially in mid and high latitudes with microtidal regimes (high 
conﬁdence). Sandy beach ecosystems will increasingly be at risk of 
eroding, reducing the habitable area for dependent organisms (high 
conﬁdence). {5.3, 5.4.1}
Almost all coral reefs will degrade from their current state, even 
if global warming remains below 2ºC (very high conﬁdence), 
and the remaining shallow coral reef communities will differ 
in species composition and diversity from present reefs (very 
high conﬁdence). These declines in coral reef health will greatly 
diminish the services they provide to society, such as food provision 
(high conﬁdence), coastal protection (high conﬁdence) and tourism 
(medium conﬁdence). {5.3.4, 5.4.1}
Multiple hazards of warming, deoxygenation, aragonite under-
saturation and decrease in ﬂux of organic carbon from the 
surface ocean will decrease calciﬁcation and exacerbate the 
bioerosion and dissolution of the non-living component of cold 
water coral. Habitat-forming, cold water corals will be vulnerable 
where temperature and oxygen exceed the species’ thresholds 
(medium conﬁdence). Reduced particulate food supply is projected 
to be experienced by 95% of cold water coral ecosystems by 2100 
under RCP8.5 relative to the present, leading to a very likely range of 
8.6 ± 2% biomass loss (medium conﬁdence). {5.2.4, Box 5.2}
Anthropogenic changes in EBUS will emerge primarily in the 
second half of the 21st century (medium conﬁdence). EBUS will 
be impacted by climate change in different ways, with strong regional 
variability with consequences for ﬁsheries, recreation and climate 
regulation (medium conﬁdence). The Paciﬁc EBUS are projected 
to have calcium carbonate undersaturation in surface waters 
within a few decades under RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence); combined 
with warming and decreasing oxygen levels, this will increase the 
impacts on shellﬁsh larvae, benthic invertebrates and demersal ﬁshes 
(high conﬁdence) and related ﬁsheries and aquaculture (medium 
conﬁdence). The inherent natural variability of EBUS, together with 
uncertainties in present and future trends in the intensity and 
seasonality of upwelling, coastal warming and stratiﬁcation, primary 
production and biogeochemistry of source waters poses large 
challenges in projecting the response of EBUS to climate change and 
to the adaptation of governance of biodiversity conservation and 
living marine resources in EBUS (high conﬁdence). {Box 5.3}
Climate change impacts on ecosystems and their goods 
and services threatens key cultural dimensions of lives and 
livelihoods. These threats include erosion of Indigenous and

non-indigenous culture, their knowledge about the ocean and 
knowledge transmission, reduced access to traditional food, loss 
of opportunities for aesthetic and spiritual appreciation of the 
ecosystems, and marine recreational activities (medium conﬁdence). 
Ultimately, these can lead to the loss of part of people’s cultural 
identity and values beyond the rate at which identify and values can 
be adjusted or substituted (medium conﬁdence). {5.4.2}
Climate change increases the exposure and bioaccumulation 
of contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and 
mercury (medium conﬁdence), and their risk of impacts on 
marine ecosystems and seafood safety (high agreement, 
medium evidence, medium conﬁdence). Such risks are particularly 
large for top predators and for human communities that have high 
consumption on these organisms, including coastal Indigenous 
communities (medium conﬁdence). {5.4.2}
Shifting distributions of ﬁsh stocks between governance 
jurisdictions will increase the risk of potential conﬂicts among 
ﬁshery area users and authorities or different communities 
within the same country (medium conﬁdence). These ﬁshery 
governance related risks are widespread under high emissions 
scenarios with regional hotspots (medium conﬁdence), and highlight 
the limits of existing natural resource management frameworks for 
addressing ecosystem change (high conﬁdence). {5.2.5, 5.4.2.1.3, 
5.5, 5.5.2}
Response options to enhance resilience
There is clear evidence for observed climate change impacts 
throughout the ocean with consequences for human 
communities and require options to reduce risks and impacts. 
Coastal blue carbon can contribute to mitigation for many 
nations but its global scope is modest (offset of <2% of 
current emissions) (likely). Some ocean indices are expected 
to emerge earlier than others (e.g.,  warming, acidiﬁcation 
and effects on ﬁsh stocks) and could therefore be used to 
prioritise planning and building resilience. The survival of 
some keystone ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs) are at risk, while 
governance structures are not well-matched to the spatial and 
temporal scale of climate change impacts on ocean systems. 
Ecosystem restoration may be able to locally reduce climate 
risks (medium conﬁdence) but at relatively high cost and 
effectiveness limited to low emissions scenarios and to less 
sensitive systems (high conﬁdence). {5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5}
Coastal blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, salt 
marshes and seagrasses, can help reduce the risks and impacts 
of climate change, with multiple co-beneﬁts. Some 151 countries 
around the world contain at least one of these coastal blue carbon 
ecosystems and 71 countries contain all three. Below-ground carbon 
storage in vegetated marine habitats can be up to 1000 tC ha–1, much 
higher than most terrestrial ecosystems (high conﬁdence). Successful 
implementation of measures to maintain and promote carbon 
storage in such coastal ecosystems could assist several countries in 
achieving a balance between emissions and removals of greenhouse 
gases (medium conﬁdence). Conservation of these habitats would 
also sustain the wide range of ecosystem services they provide and 
assist with climate adaptation through improving critical habitats 
for biodiversity, enhancing local ﬁsheries production, and protecting 
coastal communities from SLR and storm events (high conﬁdence). 
The climate mitigation effectiveness of other natural carbon removal 
processes in coastal waters, such as seaweed ecosystems and 
proposed non-biological marine CO2 removal methods, are smaller or 
currently have higher associated uncertainties. Seaweed aquaculture 
warrants further research attention. {5.5.1.1, 5.5.1.1, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, 
5.5.1.1.3, 5.5.1.1.4}
The potential climatic beneﬁts of blue carbon ecosystems 
can only be a very modest addition to, and not a replacement 
for, the very rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 
The maximum global mitigation beneﬁts of cost-effective coastal 
wetland restoration is unlikely to be more than 2% of current 
total emissions from all sources. Nevertheless, the protection 
and enhancement of coastal blue carbon can be an important 
contribution to both mitigation and adaptation at the national scale. 
The feasibility of climate mitigation by open ocean fertilisation of 
productivity is limited to negligible, due to the likely decadal-scale 
return to the atmosphere of nearly all the extra carbon removed, 
associated difﬁculties in carbon accounting, risks of unintended 
side effects and low acceptability. Other human interventions to 
enhance marine carbon uptake, for example, ocean alkalinisation 
(enhanced weathering), would also have governance challenges, 
with the increased risk of undesirable ecological consequences (high 
conﬁdence). {5.5.1.2}
Socioinstitutional adaptation responses are more frequently 
reported in the literature than ecosystem-based and built 
infrastructure approaches. Hard engineering responses are 
more effective when supported by ecosystem-based adaptation 
approaches (high agreement), and both approaches are enhanced by 
combining with socioinstitutional approaches for adaptation (high 
conﬁdence). Stakeholder engagement is necessary (robust evidence, 
high agreement). {5.5.2}
Ecosystem-based adaptation is a cost-effective coastal 
protection tool that can have many co-beneﬁts, including 
supporting livelihoods, contributing to carbon sequestration 
and the provision of a  range of other valuable ecosystem 
services (high conﬁdence). Such adaptation does, however, assume 
that the climate can be stabilised. Under changing climatic conditions 
there are limits to the effectiveness of ecosystem-based adaptation, 
and these limits are currently difﬁcult to determine. {5.5.2.1}
Socioinstitutional adaptation responses, including community-
based adaptation, capacity-building, participatory processes, 
institutional support for adaptation planning and support 
mechanisms for communities are important tools to address 
climate change impacts (high conﬁdence). For ﬁsheries 
management, improving coordination of integrated coastal 
management and marine protected areas (MPAs) have emerged in 
the literature as important adaptation governance responses (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). {5.5.2.2, 5.5.2.6}

Observed widespread decline in warm water corals has led 
to the consideration of alternative restoration approaches 
to enhance climate resilience. Approaches, such as ‘coral reef 
gardening’ have been tested, and ecological engineering and other 
approaches such as assisted evolution, colonisation and chimerism 
are being researched for reef restoration. However, the effectiveness 
of these approaches to increase resilience to climate stressors and 
their large-scale implementation for reef restoration will be limited 
unless warming and ocean acidiﬁcation are rapidly controlled (high 
conﬁdence). {Box 5.5, 5.5.2}
Existing ocean governance structures are already facing 
multi-dimensional, scale-related challenges because of climate 
change. This trend of increasing complexity will continue (high 
conﬁdence). The mechanisms for the governance of marine Areas 
Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ), such as ocean acidiﬁcation, 
would beneﬁt from further development (high conﬁdence). There 
is also scope to increase the overall effectiveness of international 
and national ocean governance regimes by increasing cooperation, 
integration and widening participation (medium conﬁdence). Diverse 
adaptations of ocean related governance are being tried, and some are 
producing promising results. However, rigorous evaluation is needed of 
the effectiveness of these adaptations in achieving their goals. {5.5.3}
There are a broad range of identiﬁed barriers and limits 
for adaptation to climate change in ecosystems and human 
systems (high conﬁdence). Limitations include the space that 
ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and human impacts that need 
to be addressed as part of the adaptation response, the lowering of 
adaptive capacity of ecosystems because of climate change, and the 
slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the recurrence of climate 
impacts, availability of technology, knowledge and ﬁnancial support 
and existing governance structures (medium conﬁdence). {5.5.2}

Introduction
The ocean is a key component of the Earth system (Chapter 1) as 
it provides essential life supporting services (Inniss et  al. 2017). 
For example, it stores heat trapped in the atmosphere caused by 
increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, it masks and slows 
surface warming, it stores excess carbon dioxide and is an important 
component of global biogeochemical cycles. The ocean is the home 
to the largest continuous ecosystem, provides habitats for rich marine 
biodiversity, is an essential source of food and contributes to human 
health, livelihood and security. The ocean also supports other services 
to humans, for example, transport and trade, tourism, renewable 
energy, and cultural services such as aesthetic appeal, local and 
traditional knowledge and religious practices. Governance of the ocean 
has a unique set of challenges and opportunities compared with land 
systems and requiring different treatment under a changing climate.
AR5 from Working Group I (WGI) showed that there are ongoing 
changes to the physical and chemical state of the ocean. The AR5 WGI 
report (IPCC, 2013) concluded that (1) ‘ocean warming dominates 
the increased energy stored in the climate system with more than 
90% of the energy accumulated since 1971’; (2) ‘the ocean has 
absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon causing 
ocean acidiﬁcation’ since pre-industrial times; and (3) it is ‘extremely 
likely that human inﬂuence has been the dominant cause of warming 
since mid 20th century’.
The IPCC AR5 Working Group II (WGII) concluded that changes in 
the ocean such as warming, acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation are 
affecting marine life from molecular processes to organisms and 
ecosystems, with major impacts on the use of marine systems by 
human societies (Pörtner, 2012). IPCC Special Report on the Impacts 
of Global Warming of 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels and related 
global greenhouse gas emission pathways (SR15) also concluded 
that reducing these risks by ‘limiting warming to 1.5ºC above 
pre-industrial levels would require transformative systemic change, 
integrated with sustainable development’ and that ‘adaptation needs 
will be lower in a 1.5ºC world compared to a 2ºC world.’ (de Coninck 
et al. 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018).
This report updates earlier assessments, evaluating new research 
and knowledge regarding changing ocean climate and ecosystems, 
risks to ecosystem services, and vulnerability of the dependent 
communities including governance. It also delves into changes the 
ocean that were beyond the scope of the previous reports. Radiation 
management techniques (also known as sunlight reﬂection methods) 
are excluded here. Such geo-engineering approaches are addressed 
in the SR15. However, natural carbon uptake and stores in the marine 
environment are included (Section 5.5.1).
The chapter is structured around three guiding questions: 
• What are the key changes in the physical and biogeochemical 
properties of the ocean? (Section 5.2.2) 
• How have these changes impacted key ecosystems, risks to 
ecosystems services and human well-being? (Section 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 
5.3, 5.4)
• Are there effective pathways for adaptation and nature-based 
solutions to risk reduction for marine dependent communities? 
(Section 5.5)
This chapter covers both regional and global scales and across natural 
and human systems. Chapter 3 covers the polar regions, including their 
oceans, Chapter 4 covers sea level rise and its implications, and Chapter 
6 covers extremes and abrupt events. This chapter uses IPCC calibrated 
language around scientiﬁc uncertainty, as described in Section 1.8.3. 
Two emissions scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, are used for projections 
of climate change (see Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).

Introduction
This section assesses changes in the ocean. It includes the physical 
and chemical properties (Section 5.2.2), their impacts on the pelagic 
ecosystem (Section 5.2.3) and deep seaﬂoor system (Section 5.2.4). 
In this assessment, the open ocean and deep seaﬂoor includes areas 
where the water column is deeper than 200 m; it is the main subject 
of Section 5.2. Coastal and shelf seas are primarily discussed in 
Section 5.3.
5.2.2 
Changes in Physical and 
Biogeochemical Properties
5.2.2.1 
Introduction to Changing Open Ocean
The ocean is getting progressively warmer, with parallel changes in 
ocean chemistry such as acidiﬁcation and oxygen loss, as documented 
in the AR5 (Rhein et  al. 2013). The global scale warming and 
acidiﬁcation trends are readily detectable in oceanic observations, 
well understood scientiﬁcally, and consistently projected by ESMs. 
Each of these has been directly attributed to anthropogenic forcing 
from changing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols 
(Bindoff et  al. 2013). These trends in the global average ocean 
temperature will continue for centuries after the anthropogenic 
forcing is stabilised (Collins et al. 2013).
The impacts on ocean ecosystems and human societies are primarily 
driven by regional trends and by the local manifestation of the global-
scale changes. At these smaller scales, the temperature, acidiﬁcation, 
salinity, nutrient and oxygen concentrations in the ocean are also 
expected to exhibit basin and local-scale changes. However, the ocean 
also has signiﬁcant natural variability at basin and local-scales with 
time scales from minutes to decades and longer (Rhein et al. 2013), 
which can mask the underlying observed and projected trends (see 
Box 5.1). The impact of multiple stressors on marine ecosystems is one 
of the main subjects of this chapter (Section 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.3), including 
new evidence and understanding since the last assessment report 
(e.g., Gunderson et al. 2016). The most severe impacts of a changing 
climate will typically be experienced when conditions are driven 
outside the range of previous experience at rates that are faster than 
human or ecological systems can adapt (Pörtner et al. 2014; Box 5.1).

This section summarises our emerging understanding of the primary 
changes to the ocean, along with an assessment of several key areas 
of scientiﬁc uncertainty about these changes. Because many of these 
long-term trends have already been extensively discussed in previous 
assessments (IPCC, 2013), much of this summary of the physical 
changes is brief except where there are signiﬁcant new ﬁndings.
5.2.2.2 
Changing Temperature, Salinity, Circulation
Historically, scientiﬁc research expeditions starting in the 19th century 
have provided occasional sections measuring deep ocean properties 
(Roemmich et al. 2012). Greater spatial and temporal coverage of 
temperatures down to about 700 m was obtained using expendable 
bathythermographs along commercial shipping tracks starting in the 
1970s (Abraham et al. 2013). Since the early 2000s, thousands of 
autonomous proﬁling ﬂoats (Argo ﬂoats) have provided high-quality 
temperature and salinity proﬁles of the upper 2000 m in ice-free 
regions of the ocean (Abraham et al. 2013; Riser et al. 2016). Further 
advances in autonomous ﬂoats have been developed that now allow 
these ﬂoats to operate in seasonally ice covered oceans (Wong and 
Riser, 2011; Wong and Riser, 2013), and more recently to proﬁle the 
entire depth of the water column down to 4000 or 6000 m (Johnson 
et al. 2015; Zilberman, 2017) and to include biogeochemical properties 
(Johnson et  al. 2017). Autonomous ﬂoats have revolutionised 
our sampling and accuracy of the global ocean temperature and 
salinity records and increased certainty and conﬁdence in global 
estimates of the earth heat (temperature) budget, particularly since 
2004 (Von  Schuckmann et  al. 2014; Roemmich et  al. 2015; Riser 
et al. 2016), as demonstrated by the convergence of observational 
estimates of the changes in the heat budget of the upper 2000 m 
(Figure 5.1). New ﬁndings using data collected from such observing 
platforms mark signiﬁcant progress since AR5.
To understand the recent and future climate, we use ensembles of 
coupled ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere-ecosystem models (ESMs) 
with the full-time history of atmospheric forcing (greenhouse gases, 
aerosols, solar radiation and volcanic eruptions) for the historical 
period and projections of the concentrations or emissions of these 
forcings to 2100. For these projections the RCPs of atmospheric 
emissions scenarios are used as speciﬁed by the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project, Phase 5 (CMIP5) (see Section 1.8.2.3, 
Cross-Chapter Box 1, and also IPCC AR5)3. This chapter focuses on the 
low and high emissions scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. 
When these scenarios are used to drive ESMs, it is possible to simulate 
the recent and future patterns of changes in the ocean temperature, 
salinity and circulation (and other oceanic properties such as ocean 
oxygen concentration and acidiﬁcation, Section 5.2.2.3 and 5.2.2.4). 
Finally, the projections of ocean changes also informs the detection, 
3 
The 30 CMIP5 ESMs used in here in various contexts were selected based on the availability of ocean data from the historical period, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 projections, 
and corresponding control runs to correct for model drift. The models used include: ACCESS1.0, ACCESS1.3, BNU-ESM, BCC-CSM1-1, CCSM4, CESM1, CMCC-CESM, 
CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3, CanESM2, FGOALS-S2.0, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-H, GISS-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-CC, 
HadGEM2-ES, INM-CM4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC-ESM, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, and NorESM1-M. Up to 
3 ensemble members or variants were included per model, and all changes are relative to a control run with an identical initial condition but with preindustrial forcing. 
A table with a description and citations for each of these models, along with more detailed discussion of the use of ESM output, can be found in Flato et al. (2013).

ZJ is Zettajoule and is equal to 1021 Joules. Warming the entire ocean by 1ºC requires about 5500 ZJ; 144 ZJ would warm the top 100 m by about 1ºC.
attribution and projection of risk and impacts on ecosystems 
(Sections 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 5.3), ecosystem services (Section 5.4.1) and 
human well-being (Section 5.4.2) under climate change.
5.2.2.2.1 Observed and projected global ocean heat uptake
As AR5 concluded, the ocean is warming as a direct result of 
anthropogenic changes to the radiative properties of the atmosphere 
and the heat budget of the Earth (very likely) (Bindoff et al. 2013). 
Over the past few decades our ocean observing system has measured 
an increase in ocean temperature (Figure 5.1). This temperature 
increase corresponds to an uptake of over 90% of the excess heat 
accumulated in the Earth system over this period (Bindoff et al. 2013; 
Rhein et al. 2013). This heat in the ocean also causes it to expand and 
has contributed about 43% of the observed global mean SLR from 
1970–2015 (Section 4.2.2.3.6).
Since AR5, there have been further improvements in our ability to 
understand and correct instrumental errors and new estimates also 
attempt to minimise biases in estimating temperature changes 
arising from traditional data-void ﬁlling strategies (Abraham et al. 
2013; Durack, 2015; Cheng and Chen, 2017; Cheng et al. 2017). New 
estimates from ocean observations of ocean heat uptake in the top 
2000 m between 1993 and 2017 very likely range from 9.2 ± 2.3 ZJ yr–1 
to 12.1 ± 3.1 ZJ yr–1 (Johnson et al. 2018)4. Three recent independent 
estimates do a better job of accounting for instrumental biases and 
the sparseness of historical ocean temperature measurements than 
the older studies assessed in AR5, and provide larger and more 
consistent estimates of heat uptake rates for the 0–2000 m layer of 
5.8 ± 1.0 ZJ yr–1 (Cheng and Chen, 2017; Cheng et al. 2017; Ishii et al. 
2017), 6.0 ± 0.8 ZJ yr–1 (updated from Domingues et al. (2008)) and 
6.3 ± 1.8 ZJ yr–1 (Cheng and Chen, 2017; Cheng et al. 2017; Ishii et al. 
2017) for the 1971–2010 period assessed by AR5.
Based on these new published methods and revised atlases we 
update the estimates for ocean heat uptake (Table 5.1, and SM5.1). 
For all of the periods assessed in Table 5.1, it is virtually certain 
that the upper ocean (0–700 m) has warmed. These results are 
consistent with earlier research into the duration of record needed 
to detect a signiﬁcant signal in global ocean heat content (Gleckler 
et al. 2012). Critically, the high conﬁdence and high agreement in 
the ocean temperature data means we can detect discernable rates 
of increase in ocean heat uptake (Gleckler et al. 2012; Cheng et al. 
2019). The rate of heat uptake in the upper ocean (0–700 m) is very 
likely higher in the 1993–2017 (or 2005–2017) period compared with 
the 1969–1993 period (see Table 5.1). The deeper layer (700–2000 m) 
heat uptake rate is likely to be higher in the 1993–2017 period 
compared with the 1969–1993 period.

The direct comparison of the observed changes in ocean heat content 
and the simulated historical changes is undertaken to detect climate 
change, to attribute the causes of climate change to the forcings in 
the system, and to evaluate the performance of ESMs. Attribution 
studies also reject competing hypotheses to explain the global ocean 
changes such as natural forcing from solar variability or volcanic 
eruptions (see Section 1.3) (Bindoff et  al. 2013). Detection and 
attribution studies have since been used to detect changes in the 
rate of ocean heat uptake and to attribute these changes to human 
activity (Gleckler et al. 2016).
Updated observationally-based estimates of ocean heat uptake 
are consistent with simulations of equivalent time-periods from an 
ensemble of CMIP5 ESMs (Table 5.1 and the inset panel in Figure 5.1) 
(high conﬁdence), once the limitations of the historical ocean observing 
network and the internally generated variability with a single realisation 
of the real world are taken into account (see Section 5.2.2.2). Following 
the CMIP5 protocol, the ESMs are radiatively forced with observationally 
derived estimates of greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols, 
including natural forcing variations from volcanic eruptions and solar 
forcing, through 2005; after 2006 each of the ESMs uses either the 
RCP2.6 or RCP8.5 emissions scenarios.

by combining data from 4 long-term estimates (Palmer et al. 2007; Levitus et al. 2012; Lyman and Johnson, 2014; Cheng and Chen, 2017; Cheng et al. 2017; Ishii et al.

In the inset subpanel, the four different shaded magenta areas are the reported very likely range of heat content changes as inferred from observations by four independent

The very likely ranges of the observed trends of heat uptake for the four 
periods and two layers all fall within the very likely range of simulated 
heat uptake from the ESM ensemble (Table 5.1). The difference between 
observations and average of the simulations in the upper ocean is an 
overestimate of heat uptake by about 20% and for the deeper layer 
there an underestimate by a similar amount, but this difference is still 
well within the very likely range from the ensemble of simulations. 
The overall consistency between observationally-based estimates and 
ESM simulations of the historical period gives greater conﬁdence in 
the projections; it is very likely that historical simulations agree with 
observations of the global ocean heat uptake (Table 5.1).
While the collection of the worlds’ ESMs have been criticised for 
having an ensemble mean that does not exhibit the observed ‘hiatus’ 
or ‘slowdown’ of global mean surface temperature increase in the early 
21st century (Meehl et al. 2011; Trenberth et al. 2016), it is increasingly

clear that this is at least in part due to the redistribution of heat within 
the climate system from the surface into the interior ocean and between 
ocean basins. Individual realisations of ESMs do show decades with 
slow increases in mean surface temperature change comparable to 
what was observed, even though these cases exhibit continued interior 
ocean heat uptake, and every ensemble member exhibits surface 
warming closer to the ensemble-mean over multi-decadal timescales 
(Meehl et al. 2011; England et al. 2015; Knutson et al. 2016).
The ocean will continue to take up heat in the coming decades for 
all plausible scenarios. As depicted in Figure 5.1, the ensemble of 
CMIP5 ESMs used by Cheng et al. (2019) project that under RCP2.6, 
the top 2000 m of the ocean will take up 935 ZJ of heat between 2015 
and 2100 (with a very likely range of 650–1340 ZJ based on the 5th 
and 95th percentiles of the 25 ESMs used here that have available 
data from the historical, scenario and control runs for RCP2.6). Under 
RCP8.5 this ensemble projects heat uptake of 2180 ZJ (with a very 
likely range of 1710–2790 ZJ, based on 35 ESMs) between 2015 and 
2100. By 2100 the ocean is very likely to warm by 2 to 4 times as 
much for low emissions (RCP2.6) and 5 to 7 times as much for the high 
emissions scenario (RCP8.5) compared with the observed changes 
since 1970. With the RCP8.5 scenario, the ocean is very likely to take up 
about twice as much heat as RCP2.6 (Figure. 5.1). Even under RCP2.6 
the ocean will continue to warm for several centuries to come (Collins 
et al. 2013). It is virtually certain that the ocean will continue to take up 
heat throughout the 21st century, and the rate of uptake will depend 
upon on the emissions scenario we collectively choose to follow.
5.2.2.2.2 Structure of anthropogenic climate changes in the ocean
The ensemble average of the CMIP5 ESMs projects widespread ocean 
warming over the coming century, concentrated in the upper ocean 
(Figures 5.2c and 5.3) (Kuhlbrodt and Gregory, 2012). The anthropogenic 
heat will penetrate into the ocean following well-established circulation 
pathways (Jones et al. 2016a). The greatest vertically integrated heat 
uptake occurs where there is already the formation of interior waters, 
such as Antarctic Intermediate Water along the Antarctic Circumpolar 
Current (Frölicher et al. 2015) or NADW precursors in the Nordic Seas 
(Figure 5.2c), but all water-masses5 that are subducted over decades 
are expected to experience signiﬁcant warming (see Figure 5.3). The 
warming in the subtropical gyres penetrates deeper into the ocean 
than other gyres (roughly 15ºN–45ºN and 15ºS–45ºS in Figure 5.3), 
following the wind-driven bowing down of the density surfaces (the 
solid lines in Figure 5.3) in these gyres (Terada and Minobe, 2018). 
The greater warming at 700–2000 m in the Atlantic than the Paciﬁc 
or Indian Oceans (Figure 5.3) reﬂects the strong southward transport 
of recently formed NADW at these depths by the AMOC. Two areas 
that commonly exhibit substantially reduced near-surface warming 
over the course of the 21st century are the northern north Atlantic, 
where a slowing AMOC (see Section 6.7.1.1) reduces the northward 
heat transport and brings the surface temperatures closer to what is 
found in other ocean basins at these latitudes (Collins et al. 2013), 
and the southern side of the Southern Ocean, where water upwells 
5 
Following common oceanographic practice dating back to Helland-Hansen (1916) and discussed in detail by Sverdrup et al. (1942), an ocean water-mass is deﬁned as 
a large volume of seawater with a characteristic range of temperature and salinity properties, typically falling along a line in temperature-salinity space, often with common 
formation processes and locations.
that has been submerged for so long that it has not yet experienced 
signiﬁcant anthropogenic climate change (Armour et al. 2016). Most 
of these projected warming patterns are broadly consistent across 
the current and previous generations of climate models (Mitchell 
et al. 1995; Collins et al. 2014) as well as observations and theoretical 
understanding. These multiple lines of evidence give high conﬁdence 
that the projections describe the changes in the real world (high 
agreement, robust evidence).
The near surface salinity of the ocean is both observed and projected 
to evolve in ways that reﬂect the increased intensity of the Earth’s 
hydrologic cycle (Durack, 2015) and the increasing near-surface ocean 
stratiﬁcation (Zika et al. 2018). As described in WGI AR5, the ocean 
surface in areas that currently have net evaporation are expected to 
become saltier, while areas with net precipitation are expected to get 
fresher (Rhein et  al. 2013), as the patterns of precipitation and 
evaporation are generally expected to be ampliﬁed (Held and Soden, 
2006). At longer time-scales of decades, the larger scale changes in 
the ocean circulation and basin integrated freshwater imbalances 
emerge in the near-surface salinity changes, as shown in Figure 5.3b, 
with an increasingly salty tropical and subtropical Atlantic and 
Mediterranean contrasting with a freshening Paciﬁc and polar Arctic 
emerging as robust signals across the suite of ESMs (Collins et al. 
2013). The freshening of the high latitudes in the north Atlantic and 
Arctic basin is consistent with the widely expected weakening of the 
AMOC (also discussed in Section 6.7), hydrological cycle changes and 
a decline in the volume of sea ice (discussed in Section 3.2.2).
Projected salinity changes in the subsurface ocean reﬂect changes 
in the rates of formation of water masses or their newly formed 
properties (Purich et  al. 2018). Thus, projected freshening of the 
Southern Ocean surface leads to a freshening of the Antarctic 
Intermediate Water that is subducted there, ﬂowing northward from 
the Southern Ocean as a relatively fresh water-mass at depths of 
500–1500 m (Figure 5.3b). Increased surface salinity in the Atlantic 
subtropical gyres are pumped into the interior by the winds, leading 
to an increased salinity of the interior subtropical gyres, along with 
contributions from increasingly salty Mediterranean water (Jordà 
et  al. 2017). Conversely, freshwater capping of the northwestern 
north Atlantic is projected to inhibit deep convection in the Labrador 
Sea and the consequent production of Labrador Sea Water in some 
models (Collins et al. 2013), and contributes to the increased salinity 
of the north Atlantic between 1000–2000 m depths (Figure 5.3b).
Identifying the speciﬁc patterns of anthropogenic climate changes in 
oceanic observations is complicated by the presence of basin-scale 
natural variability with timescales ranging from tidal to multi-decadal, 
and due to the difﬁculties associated with maintaining high-precision 
observing systems spanning the ocean basins and limited 
observational coverage of the extratropical Southern Hemisphere 
before 2006 (Rhein et al. 2013). Inferences based on oceanographic 
observations from the 1970s onward show wide-spread warming 
of the upper 700 m (Figure 5.2a), in broad agreement with the 
461

ensemble of historical CMIP5 ESM simulations (Figure 5.2b). These 
ESMs indicate that anthropogenic regional warming over the past 
half-century should be discernable at the 95% conﬁdence level in 
much of the upper oceans (un-stippled areas in Figure 5.2b). Most 
of the areas where observational analyses (Figure 5.2a) exhibit 
long-term cooling are either regions where the internally generated 
variability is large enough to mask the trends (e.g.,  the Eastern 
Tropical Paciﬁc, Northwest Atlantic, and Kurushio extension east of 
Japan, which are stippled in Figure 5.2b), or where the observational 
coverage early in the record is limited and different analyses can 
disagree about trends (e.g., the Southern Ocean and extratropical 
South Paciﬁc). When internal variability is taken into account, the

broad consistency in the magnitude and regional distribution of 
observed and simulated 50-year trends gives conﬁdence to the ESM 
projections of longer-term oceanic changes described previously.
Detailed regional patterns of trends in temperature and heat content 
at depths of 0–2000 m during the early 21st century are consistent 
in various analysis, owing to the improved observing network 
(Roemmich et al. 2015; Desbruyères et al. 2016a) (Figure 5.2d). At 
depths of 700–2000 m, observations in all of the ocean basins show 
broadly warming trends in the well-observed Argo era (2006  to 
present), with particularly signiﬁcant warming patterns in the 
Southern Hemisphere extratropics around 40ºS and the subpolar 
north Atlantic (Figure  5.3a). These observed changes support 
the notion that deep ocean heat content has been continuously 
increasing. As a result, regional climate change signatures emerge 
from confounding natural variability sooner in the 700–2000 m 
depth range than in upper 700 m of the ocean, where interannual 
modes of variability have a larger inﬂuence on the circulation (for 
a more complete discussion see Johnson et  al. (2018)). Despite 
regional patches of cooling water in the upper 700 m (Figure 5.2d), 
every one of the world’s ocean basins volume averaged over 
depths of 0–2000 m has experienced signiﬁcant warming over 
the last decade (Figure  5.3, and also Desbruyères et  al. (2016a)). 
The greatest warming of the top 2000 m has been in the Southern 
Ocean (Roemmich et  al. 2015; Trenberth et  al. 2016), the tropical 
and subtropical Paciﬁc Ocean (Roemmich  et  al. 2015), and the 
tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean (Cheng and Chen, 2017). The 
Southern Hemisphere extratropical oceans accounted for 67–98% of 
the total ocean heat increase in the uppermost 2000 m for the period 
of 2006–2013 (Roemmich et al. 2015). Shi et al. (2018) suggest that 
the dominant ocean heat uptake by the Southern Hemisphere in the 
early 21st century is expected to become more balanced between 
the hemispheres as the asymmetric cooling by aerosols decreases.
Large-scale patterns of natural variability at interannual to decadal 
time scales can mask the long-term warming trend in the upper 
700 m, particularly in the tropical Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans (England 
et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2016) and in the north Atlantic (Buckley and 
Marshall, 2015). The most signiﬁcant upper 700 m warming between 
ﬁve-year averages centered on 2007–2015 occurred in a large 
extratropical band of the Southern Hemisphere between 30ºS–60ºS, 
and in the tropical Indian Ocean, the eastern North Paciﬁc and western 
subtropical north Atlantic (Figure 5.2d). Warming of the southern 
hemisphere subtropical gyres is driven, in part, by an intensiﬁcation of 
Southern Ocean winds in recent decades, facilitating the penetration 
of heat to deeper depths (Gao et al. 2018). Marginal seas, such as the 
Mediterranean and Red seas have also exhibited notable warming. 
Conversely, over this timeframe there were also regions of cooling 
in the upper 700 m, notably in the north Atlantic around 40ºN–60ºN 
and in the western tropical Paciﬁc (Figure 5.2d). Recent relatively 
cold and fresh surface and subsurface conditions in the north Atlantic 
have been attributed to anomalous atmospheric forcing (Josey et al. 
2018) or weakened transport by the north Atlantic Current and 
AMOC (Smeed et al. 2018), and in turn may have contributed to an 
intensiﬁcation of deep convection in the Labrador Sea since 2012 
(Yashayaev and Loder, 2017). All these observed decadal changes 
can be related to internal decadal variability (Robson et al. 2014; 
Yeager et al. 2015) even though they resemble expected longer-term 
anthropogenically forced trends. Substantial decadal-scale warming 
and cooling trends in the tropical Paciﬁc and Indian oceans can arise 
from natural El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean 
Dipole variability (Han et al. 2014). Large ensembles of freely running 
CMIP5 ESM simulations also show that internal variability can 
dominate the regional manifestation of the anthropogenic climate 
signal on decadal timescales (Kay et al. 2014). This is illustrated by the 
differing warming trends in Figure 5.2e and 5.2f from two identical 
ESMs that differ only in the weather in their 1850 initial conditions, 
averaged over the whole 21st century, by contrast, the ensemble of 
CMIP5 models project statistically signiﬁcant anthropogenic regional 
upper 700 m heat content trends almost everywhere (Figure 5.2c).
There are well documented changes in observed ocean temperatures 
and salinities (Abraham et  al. 2013; Ishii et  al. 2017). However, 
attributing these changes in the state of the ocean to anthropogenic 
causes can be challenging due to the presence of internally generated 
variability, which can swamp the underlying climate change signal in 
short records and on regional scales. As can be seen in Figure 5.2, the 
observed long-term trends (Figure 5.2a) exhibit a striking similarity 
to the CMIP5 ensemble mean in areas where the models suggest 
that anthropogenic changes should be statistically signiﬁcant 
(Figure 5.2b). However, the trends in the shorter well-observed 
period covering 2005–2017 (Figure 5.2d) exhibits strong trends from 
internal variability, as illustrated by the differences of two ensemble 
members of the same ESM with the same forcing but initialised with 
different weather (Figure 5.2e and 5.2f). Detection and Attribution 
studies take the internal variability into account and separate the 
underlying climate signals with the same spatio-temporal sampling 
as the observations, and apply a range of statistical tests to determine 
the coherence of the observations with the co-sampled observations 
(Bindoff et al. 2013; AR5 WG1 Box 10.1).
Since AR5, the use of different and updated oceanographic data sets 
and increase in the number of ensembles of the CMIP5 simulations 
(Kay et al. 2014) has improved the overall detection and attribution of 
human inﬂuence. Together these measures increase the coherence of 
the simulations and reduce noise. For example, an isotherm approach 
used to reduce the noise from the displacement of isotherms in the 
upper water column allowing detection in each of the mid-latitude 
ocean basins was achieved on 60-year time series (Weller et al. 2016). 
Using all the available ocean temperature and salinity proﬁles from 
the Southern Ocean, Swart et al. (2018) show that the warming and 
freshening patterns were consistent primarily with increased human 
induced greenhouse gases and secondarily from ozone depletion in 
the stratosphere, but inconsistent with internal variability. Together 
the evidence from the AR5, and the discussion above with the new 
evidence on regional scales across the global oceans, we conclude that 
the observed long-term upper ocean temperature changes are very 
likely to have a substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcing.
The wind-driven ocean circulation at the end of the 21st century is 
expected to be qualitatively similar to that in the present day, even as 
important buoyancy-loss driven overturning circulations are expected 
to weaken. ESM projections suggest that some major ocean current 
transports will exhibit a modest increase (such as the Kuroshio 
463
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5
5
Extension (Terada and Minobe, 2018) or a small decrease such as for the 
Indonesian Throughﬂow (Sen Gupta et al. 2016); many predominantly 
wind-driven current-system transports are expected to exhibit smaller 
than 20% changes by 2100 with RCP8.5 forcing. Climate-change 
induced changes of the circulation in other mid-latitude basins 
may be difﬁcult to detect or reliably project because of signiﬁcant 
natural variability at inter-annual (e.g., El Niño) to decadal (e.g., the 
Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation) timescales. The Antarctic Circumpolar 
Current is projected to be subject to strengthening westerly winds 
and substantially reduced rates of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) 
formation, as assessed in the Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3. The 
heat transported by the buoyancy-loss driven AMOC, in particular, 
contributes to the relatively clement climate of northern Europe and 
the north Atlantic Basin as a whole, although the wind-driven ocean 
gyres also contribute to the meridional ocean heat transport (see the 
review by Buckley and Marshall (2015)). As a result, there is a concern 
that signiﬁcant changes in ocean circulation could lead to localised 
climate changes that are much larger than the global mean. Projected 
and observed changes in the AMOC and the rates of formation of deep 
water-masses in the north Atlantic are discussed in Chapter 6.7.1, 
along with the possibility of abrupt or enduring changes resulting from 
forcing by Greenlandic meltwater. A signiﬁcant reduction in AMOC 
would, in turn, modestly weaken the Gulf Stream transport, which also 
has a substantial wind driven component (Frajka-Williams et al. 2016). 
Most aspects of the large-scale wind-driven ocean circulation are very 
likely to be qualitatively similar to the circulation in the present day, 
with only modest changes in transports and current location.
The global ocean below 2000 m has warmed signiﬁcantly between 
the 1980s and 2010s (Figure 5.4), contributing to ocean heat uptake 
and through thermal expansion to SLR (Purkey and Johnson, 2010; 
Desbruyères et al. 2016b). The observed deep warming rate varies 
regionally and by depth reﬂecting differences in the waters inﬂuencing 
particular regions. The deep and abyssal north Atlantic, fed by North 
Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), has reversed from warming to cooling 
over the past decade, possibly associated with the North Atlantic 
Oscillation (NAO) (e.g., Yashayaev, 2007; Desbruyères et  al. 2014) 
or longer-term weakening in north Atlantic overturning circulation 
(Caesar et al. 2018; Thornalley et al. 2018). The strongest warming 
is observed in regions of the deep ocean AABW (Purkey et al. 2014). 
Regions of the ocean fed by AABW from the Weddell Sea have 
exhibited a possible slowdown in local AABW warming rates (Lyman 
and Johnson, 2014), while the Paciﬁc, fed by AABW from the shelves 
along the Ross and Adelie Coast, has continued to warm at an 
accelerating rate between 1990 and 2018 (Desbruyères et al. 2016b).
To date, assessment of deep ocean (below 2000 m) heat content has 
mostly been from ship-based data collected along decadal repeats 
of oceanographic transects (Figure 5.4b) (Talley et al. 2016). While 
relatively sparse in space and time compared to the upper ocean, 
these transects were positioned to optimise sampling of most deep 
ocean basins and provide the highest quality of salinity, temperature 
and pressure data. Argo ﬂoats capable of sampling to 6000 m have 
just started to populate select deep ocean basins; this Deep Argo data 
has just started providing regional deep ocean warming estimates 
(Johnson et al. 2019). Decadal monitoring by the full global Deep 
Argo array (Johnson et al. 2015), complemented by indirect estimates 
from space (Llovel et al. 2014; Von Schuckmann et al. 2014), will 
strongly reduce the currently large uncertainties of deep ocean heat 
content change estimates in the future.
The spatial and temporal sparseness of observations below 4000 m, 
along with signiﬁcant differences between various ESMs, limits our 
understanding of the exact mechanisms driving the abyssal ocean 
variability. However, ESMs consistently predict an anthropogenic 
climate-change induced long-term abyssal warming trend originating 
in the Southern Ocean due to a reduction in the formation rates of 
cold AABW (Heuzé et al. 2015). Although the abyssal modes of natural 
variability are not as pronounced as closer to the surface, deep ocean 
heat content can vary on relatively short time scales through the 
communication of topographic and planetary waves driven by changes 
in the rate of deep water formation at high latitudes (Kawase, 1987;

Masuda et al. 2010; Spence et al. 2017). AABW has shown variability in 
properties and production rates over the past half century (Purkey and 
Johnson, 2013; Menezes et al. 2017). A slowdown in AABW formation 
rates may arise from freshening of shelf waters, changes in local 
winds driving cross shelf mixing, or larger scale dynamics controlling 
the spin up or down of Southern Ocean gyres inﬂuencing the density 
of outﬂowing waters over deep sills. Large-scale circulation changes 
can also alter the properties of the ambient water that is entrained as 
dense water descends along the Antarctic continental slopes (Spence 
et al. 2017). Evolving AABW properties may also reﬂect changes in 
deep Southern Ocean convection. The Weddell Polynya is a large 
opening in the wintertime ice of the Weddell Sea that is kept ice-free 
despite intense heat loss to the atmosphere by convective mixing 
bringing up warm and salty water from the deep ocean. (See Box 3.2 
for a more extensive discussion of polynyas and the Weddell Polynya 
in particular). The Weddell Polynya was present in three of the 
ﬁrst years of infrared satellite observations of wintertime sea ice 
concentrations in the mid-1970s, but it has been closed since 1976, 
only to reopen in 2016 and 2017. The prominent Weddell Polynya in 
the mid-1970s greatly increased the volume of the coldest waters 
in the deep Weddell Sea. Weddell Polynyas are documented to drive 
abyssal cold and salty signals and can spread thermal signals as waves 
further and faster than could be explained by slow advective signals 
(Martin et al. 2015; Zanowski and Hallberg, 2017); these waves do 
not directly heat individual water parcels, but instead warm the ocean 
where they cause the coldest deep layers to spread laterally and thin. 
However, recovery from the large Weddell polynya of the early 1970s 
can only explain about 20% of the observed abyssal warming trend 
(Zanowski et al. 2015).
The ocean’s properties are changing most rapidly in the near surface 
waters that are more immediately exposed to atmospheric forcing. 
As a result of the surface-intensiﬁed warming, the upper few 
hundred meters of the ocean are becoming more stably stratiﬁed 
(Helm  et  al.  2011; Talley et  al. 2016). The combination of surface 
intensiﬁed warming and near-surface freshening at high latitudes 
leading to a projection of more intense near-surface stratiﬁcation 
(the downward-increasing vertical gradient of density) across all 
ocean basins (Figures 5.3 and 5.5) is a robust result with a high 
agreement across successive generations of coupled climate models 
(Capotondi et al. 2012; Bopp et al. 2013). Based on the projected 
changes from individual models between 1986–2005 and 2081–
2100, the mean stratiﬁcation of the upper 200 m averaged between 
60ºS–60ºN, normalised by the ensemble mean value from 1986–2005 
will very likely increase by between 1.0–9.3% (with 95% conﬁdence 
and a CMIP5 median change of 2.6%) for RCP2.6, and by between 
12.2–30.0% (median value 21.2%) for RCP8.5. Inferences from 
oceanic observations (Good et  al. 2013) suggest that the 20-year 
mean stratiﬁcation averaged between 60ºS–60ºN and over the top 
200 m very likely increased by between 2.18–2.42% from 1971–1990 
to 1998–2017. By contrast, the bottom intensiﬁed warming in the 
abyss (see Figure 5.4) which is consistent with a slowing in the 
rate of AABW formation, is also associated with a reduction in 
the abyssal stratiﬁcation of the ocean (Lyman and Johnson, 2014; 
Desbruyères et al. 2016b). Both of these changes have consequences 
for the evolving turbulence and ocean water-mass structure. Based 
on observational evidence, theoretical understanding and robust 
ESM projections, it is very likely that stratiﬁcation in the upper few 
hundred meters of the ocean below the mixed layer will increase 
signiﬁcantly in the 21st century over most ocean basins as a result of 
climate change, and abyssal stratiﬁcation will likely decrease.
Many dynamical consequences of increased stratiﬁcation are 
understood with very high conﬁdence (see, for instance, Gill (1982) 
and Vallis (2017)). For the same turbulent kinetic energy dissipation, 
locally increased stratiﬁcation reduces the turbulent vertical diffusivity 
of heat, salinity, oxygen and nutrients (see Section 5.2.2.2.4). Increased 
stratiﬁcation in the tropics and subtropical gyres will likely lead to 
a net reduction in the vertical diffusivities of nutrients and other gases 
within the main thermocline, reducing the ﬂux of nutrients into the

euphotic zone and increasing the gradient in oxygen concentrations 
between the near surface ocean and the interior. Increasing upper 
ocean stratiﬁcation (Figure 5.5) acts to restrict the depth of the 
ocean’s surface mixed layer. Increasing stratiﬁcation increases the 
buoyancy frequency and the lateral propagation speed of internal 
gravity waves and boundary waves by about half the percentage 
change of the stratiﬁcation itself. Increasing stratiﬁcation increases 
both the length of the internal deformation radius (a typical length 
scale in baroclinic eddy dynamics) and the horizontal scales of internal 
tides (see Section 5.2.2.2.3) proportionately with the changes in the 
internal gravity wave speeds. An increase in stratiﬁcation will increase 
the lateral propagation of internal Rossby waves (which set up the 
basin-scale ocean density structure) proportionately. For the same 
forcing, increasing stratiﬁcation reduces the geostrophically balanced 
slope of density surfaces, and hence the vertical extent of basin-scale 
wind-driven gyres or coastal upwelling circulations. The ﬂattening of 
density surfaces by increased stratiﬁcation inhibits advective exchange 
between the surface and interior ocean (Wang et  al. 2015a), with 
consequences for the uptake of anthropogenic carbon (Section 5.2.2.3), 
the evolving oxygen distribution (Section 5.2.2.4) and the supply of 
nutrients to support primary production (Section 5.2.2.5).
5.2.2.2.3 Tides and coastal physical changes in a changing climate
Coastal systems are subject to the same large-scale warming trends 
as the open ocean, but the local response may be dominated by 
a complex of localised changes in factors such as circulation, mixing, 
river plumes or the seasonal upwelling of cold water. Using ESMs 
to project how these factors will interact often requires much ﬁner 
resolution than is currently affordable in global models, however 
regional high-resolution models can be effective, especially in 
marginal seas like the Mediterranean with restricted interactions 
with the open ocean and that respond primarily to local forcing 
(Adloff et al. 2015). High resolution regional models have also been 
used to project robust localised ocean climate changes in wide shelf 
seas with more extensive interactions with the open ocean, like those 
in northwestern Europe (Tinker et al. 2016). The technical difﬁculties 
of using nested regional models are much greater in coasts adjacent 
to energetic large-scale currents like the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio, and 
Agulhas, and projecting detailed coastal climate change such places 
may require the use of expensive high resolution global models (Saba 
et al. 2016). These physical coastal changes have consequences that 
cascade through ecosystems to people, as is illustrated in detail for 
eastern boundary upwelling systems in Box 5.2.
Both human structures and ecological systems in the coastal zone 
are directly impacted by tidal amplitudes, which contribute to high-
water levels and the tidal ﬂushing rates of estuaries, embayments, 
marshes and mangroves. The tides are the response of a forced-
damped-resonance system (Arbic et  al. 2009). The M2 tide is the 
dominant tidal constituent in most places, with a period of half 
a lunar day, or 12 hours, 25 minutes; the M2 tides are created by the 
differential motion of the solid Earth and oceans in response to the 
gravitational attraction of the moon (Newton, 1687; Laplace, 1799). 
The astronomical forcing evolves only slowly, however the tidal 
damping and basin resonance at tidal frequencies can change in 
response to changes in sea level, stratiﬁcation and coastal conditions 
(Müller, 2012; Schindelegger et al. 2018). Several recent studies have 
analysed historical coastal tide gauge data and found amplitude trends 
of order 1–4% per century (Ray, 2009; Woodworth, 2010; Müller 
et al. 2011). In some locations, the changes in the tides have been of 
comparable importance to changes in mean sea level for explaining 
changes in high water levels (Jay, 2009). For many individual tide 
gauges, the trends in tidal amplitude are strongly positively or 
negatively correlated with local time-mean sea level trends (Devlin 
et  al. 2017). Another source of secular tidal changes, changes in 
oceanic stratiﬁcation, modiﬁes the rate of energy conversion from the 
barotropic tides to the internal tides (Jayne and St. Laurent, 2001), 
the vertical proﬁle of turbulent viscosity on shelves (Müller, 2012), 
and the propagation speed of the internal tides (Zhao, 2016). For 
example, Colosi and Munk (2006) found an increase in the amplitude 
of the principal lunar semidiurnal tide M2 in Honolulu of about 1 cm 
over the past 100 years, which they attributed primarily to changes 
in oceanic stratiﬁcation bringing about local changes in relative 
phases of the internal and external M2 tides, increasing constructive 
interference. Both sea level and stratiﬁcation are expected to exhibit 
robust secular positive trends in the coming century due to climate 
change, at rates that are signiﬁcantly larger than historical trends, and 
people may choose to replace natural beaches and marshes with sea-
walls in response to rising sea levels. As a result, it is very likely that 
the majority of coastal regions will experience statistically signiﬁcant 
changes in tidal amplitudes over the course of the 21st century.
Because coastal tides are near resonance in many locations, small 
changes in sea level and bay shape can change the local tides 
signiﬁcantly. For example, the insertion of tidal power plants can 
have a signiﬁcant impact on the local tides (Ward et  al. 2012). 
Various observational and modeling studies demonstrate that SLR 
has spatial heterogeneous impacts on the tides, with some locations 
experiencing decreased tidal amplitudes and others experiencing 
increased tidal amplitudes (Pickering et al. 2012; Devlin et al. 2017; 
Pickering et al. 2017). Projections of tidal changes indicate that the 
patterns and even the sign of changes in tidal amplitudes depend on 
whether the coastlines are allowed to recede with rising sea levels 
or are held in place (Pickering et al. 2017; Schindelegger et al. 2018). 
Pelling et al. (2013) and Hwang et al. (2014) demonstrate that the 
rapid coastline changes in China’s Bohai Sea have already altered 
the tides in that region and throughout the Yellow Sea (Hwang et al. 
2014). Pelling and Green (2014) examine the impact of ﬂood defenses 
as well as SLR on tides on the European Shelf. Such tidal changes 
have implications for designing ﬂood defenses, for tidal renewable 
energy, for tidal ﬂushing timescales of estuaries and embayments, 
and for navigational dredging requirements (Pickering et al. 2012) 
(Section  5.4.2). The sign and amplitude of local changes to tides 
are very likely to be impacted by both human coastal adaptation 
measures and climate drivers (listed above).
5.2.2.2.4 Systematic sources of uncertainty in projections  
of ocean physical changes
ESMs are able to capture the dynamics of the climate system, but 
all numerical models have approximations and biases. The most 
commonly used type of ocean component in ESMs is known to exhibit 
numerically induced vertical mixing that can be a signiﬁcant fraction 
466
Chapter 5 
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities
5
of the physical mixing (Ilıcak et al. 2012; Megann, 2018). Because so 
many ocean models exhibit the same sign of bias, there is a systematic 
warming of the lower-main thermocline that is not cancelled out when 
taking the average over the ensemble of all the models in CMIP5. These 
biases are widely known within the ocean modelling community, and 
various groups are working to reduce these biases in future ESMs 
with better ocean model numerics and parameterisations. To correct 
for model biases, ESM projections are always taken as the difference 
from a control run without the anomalous forcing. However, some 
aspects of the ocean response to climate change are nonlinear, and 
model biases can introduce uncertainties into climate projections. In 
the case of heat uptake, this is of the order of 10% uncertainty, while 
for the rate of steric SLR (which depends on the nonlinear equation 
of state of seawater) the uncertainty in CMIP5 models is of the order 
of 20% (Hallberg et al. 2012).
Mesoscale eddies (geostrophic rotating vortices with spatial scales 
of 10–100 km that penetrate deeply into the water column, and 
are often described as the ocean’s weather) play an important role 
in regulating the changes to the larger scale ocean circulation, 
especially in the Antarctic Circumpolar current, as is discussed in 
Cross Chapter Box 7. In addition, sub-mesoscale eddies (rotationally 
inﬂuenced motions with smaller horizontal scales of hundreds of 
metres to about 10 km and intrinsic timescales of a few days that 
especially arise in association with fronts in the ocean’s surface 
properties) are known to be particularly important in the dynamics 
of the near-surface ocean boundary layer (see the review by 
Mahadevan (2016)). Sub-mesoscale instabilities are associated with 
re-stratifying overturning circulations that can limit the thickness of 
the well-mixed ocean surface boundary layer near fronts (Bachman 
et  al. 2017). Moreover, sub-mesoscale motions generate strong 
vertical velocities that drive ﬂuxes of nutrients from the interior 
ocean into the euphotic zone or create pockets of reduced mixing 
with increased phytoplankton residency time within the euphotic 
zone (Lévy et  al. 2012). Intense mesoscale eddies are known to 
create favourable conditions for sub-mesoscale instabilities as shown 
in both observational (Bachman et al. 2017) and numerical studies 
(Brannigan et al. 2017). Intensifying Southern Ocean eddy ﬁelds will 
have a signiﬁcant local impact on biological productivity, ecosystem 
structure, and carbon uptake, both directly and via sub-mesoscale 
processes. At typical CMIP5 ESM resolutions, it is only in the tropics 
that mesoscale eddies are adequately resolved to explicitly model 
their effects (Hallberg, 2013), while sub-mesoscale eddies are not 
resolved anywhere, so eddy effects need to be parameterised in ESMs. 
Despite great progress over the past 30 years in parameterising eddy 
effects, uncertainties in these parameterisations and how eddies will 
respond to novel conditions continue to contribute to uncertainties in 
projections of oceanic climate change (medium conﬁdence).
Ocean turbulent mixing is a key process regulating the ocean 
circulation and climate. Turbulent mixing is important for the uptake 
and redistribution of heat, carbon, nutrients, oxygen and other tracers 
(properties that are carried along with the ﬂow of water) in the ocean 
(Schmittner et al. 2009; MacKinnon et al. 2017). Both observations and 
theory indicate that turbulent mixing in the ocean is not constant in 
space or time. Global estimates of both the turbulent kinetic energy

dissipation rate and the vertical diffusivity, two measures of ocean 
turbulence, vary over several orders of magnitude throughout the 
ocean (Figure 5.6) (Polzin et al. 1997; Waterman et al. 2012; Whalen 
et al. 2012; Alford et al. 2013; Hummels et al. 2013; Sheen et al. 2013; 
Waterhouse et al. 2014; Kunze, 2017). For a given energy dissipation rate, 
the turbulent diffusivities of heat, salinity, nutrients and other tracers 
tend to be smaller with stronger stratiﬁcation. This dependency on 
stratiﬁcation helps explain why the observationally inferred diffusivity 
in the heavily stratiﬁed main thermocline (250–1000 m depth) is of 
similar magnitude to those deeper in the water column, while the 
turbulent energy density and dissipation rate are much stronger at 
the shallower depths (Whalen et al. 2012). Oceanic turbulence also 
ﬂuctuates in time, is modulated by tidal cycles (Klymak et al. 2008), 
the mesoscale eddy ﬁeld and seasonal changes (Whalen et al. 2018). 
In the mixed layer and directly below, turbulence changes according 
to local conditions, such as the winds, heating rates and local 
stratiﬁcation (Sloyan et al. 2010; Moum et al. 2013; D’Asaro, 2014; 
Tanaka et al. 2015) at diurnal to seasonal and longer timescales. These 
variations in near-surface turbulence need to be taken into account 
for ESMs to reproduce more accurately the observed seasonal cycle of 
surface properties and spatial structure of the depth of the thermally 
well-mixed near surface layer of the ocean. The spatial and temporal 
patterns of ocean turbulence help shape ocean tracer distributions 
(heat, dissolved greenhouse gases and nutrients) and how they will 
evolve in a changing climate (high conﬁdence).
Ocean turbulent mixing requires energy sources, many of which 
are expected to change with a changing climate. Surface wind and 
buoyancy forcing, the mean and eddying larger-scale ocean circulation 
itself, and the barotropic tides are all thought to be signiﬁcant 
sources of the energy that drives mixing (Wunsch and Ferrari, 2004). 
Often this energy ﬁrst passes through the ocean’s pervasive ﬁeld of 
internal gravity waves that propagate and refract through the varying 
ocean circulation, often breaking into turbulent mixing far from their 
sources (Eden and Olbers, 2014; Alford et al. 2016; Melet et al. 2016; 
Meyer et al. 2016; Zhao et al. 2016b). The energy contributing to the 
internal waves from the winds and the subsequent turbulence will 
be altered by changes in tropical storm activity or sea ice coverage. 
For example, the increasing extent of ice-free Arctic Ocean has 
already been observed to lead to increased wind-driven internal 
waves (Dosser and Rainville, 2016). The Southern Annular Mode is 
expected to intensify as a result of climate change (Young et al. 2011; 
Jones et al. 2016b), bringing with it stronger winds, and more wind-
energy input over most of the Southern Ocean and a more intense 
mesoscale eddy ﬁeld (Hogg et al. 2015). Changes in the near-bottom 
stratiﬁcation will alter the rate that the barotropic tides generate 
internal waves, thereby altering the strength and distribution of the 
tidally generated mixing. Some of the parameterisations of interior 
ocean mixing used in CMIP5 ESMs take some changing turbulent 
energy sources into account (Jayne and St. Laurent, 2001), and more 
comprehensive mixing treatments are being developed for use in 
future generations of ESMs (Eden and Olbers, 2014). However, not 
all of the physical processes leading to the rich structure of mixing 
shown in Figure 5.6 are well understood or included in ESMs; the 
prospect of signiﬁcant changes in the patterns and intensity of ocean 
turbulent mixing is a potential source of uncertainty (probably at 
the 10% level) in projections of physical and ecological changes in 
the ocean, including heat uptake, stratiﬁcation changes, steric SLR, 
deoxygenisation and nutrient ﬂuxes (medium conﬁdence).
5.2.2.3 
Changes in Ocean Carbon
Since AR5, new global-scale data synthesis products, novel methods 
for their analyses, as well as progress in modeling have substantially 
increased our quantitative understanding of the role of the ocean in 
absorbing and storing CO2 from the atmosphere. The most important 
progress concerns the data-based quantiﬁcation of the temporal 
variability of the ocean carbon sink. While AR5 assessed primarily 
the climatological mean processes governing the ocean carbon cycle, 
the most recent work now permits us to assess how these processes 
have changed in recent decades in response to climate variability and 
change. Here we focus speciﬁcally on the open ocean carbon cycle.
5.2.2.3.1 Ocean carbon ﬂuxes and inventories
The analyses of the steadily growing number of surface ocean CO2 
observations (now more than 20 million observations, SOCATv6 
(www.socat.info/index.php/2018/06/19/v6-release) demonstrate that 
the net ocean uptake of CO2 from the atmosphere has increased from 
around 1.2 ± 0.5 Pg C yr–1 in the early 1980s to 2.0 ± 0.5 Pg C yr–1 
in the years 2010–2015 (Rödenbeck et al. 2014; Landschützer et al. 
2016). Once new estimates of the outgassing ﬂux stemming from 
river derived carbon of 0.8 Pg C yr–1 (Resplandy et  al. 2018) are 
accounted for, these new observations imply that the rate of global 
ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 increased from 2.0 ± 0.5 Pg C yr–1 
to 2.8  ±  0.5  Pg  C  yr–1 between the early 1980s and 2010–2015 
(Rödenbeck et al. 2014; Landschützer et al. 2016; Le Quéré et al. 2018). 
This increase is supported by the current generation of ocean carbon 
cycle models (Le  Quéré et  al. 2018), and commensurate with the 
increase in atmospheric CO2.
The continuing efforts to re-measure dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) 
along many of the repeat hydrographic lines that were occupied during 
the 1980s and 1990 (Talley et al. 2016), alongside the preparation of 
a global quality controlled database of ocean interior observations 
(Olsen et al. 2016a), have led to progress since AR5 regarding to 
the oceanic interior storage of anthropogenic CO2. Several studies 
analysed the changes in the amount of anthropogenic CO2 that have 
accumulated between different occupations in the different ocean 
basins (Wanninkhof et al. 2010; Pérez et al. 2013; Woosley et al. 2016; 
Carter et al. 2017), conﬁrming that the anthropogenic CO2 taken up 
from the atmosphere is transported to depth, where most of it is 
stored. Using a newly developed reconstruction method, Gruber et al. 
(2019) extended these results to the globe. They ﬁnd that between 
1994 and 2007, across two standard deviations, that the global 
ocean has accumulated an additional 30–38 Pg C of anthropogenic 
CO2, which is equivalent to an air-sea CO2 ﬂux of between 
2.3–2.9 Pg C yr–1 (coherent with surface ocean CO2 observations), 
bringing the total inventory for the year 2007 to 150 ± 20 Pg C. 
Extrapolating this estimate to the year 2010 gives an inventory of 
158 ± 18 Pg C, which is statistically indistinguishable from the ‘best’ 
estimate provided by Khatiwala et al. (2013) of 155 ± 31 Pg C and 
more recently also found from a steady-state ocean model (DeVries, 
2014) for this reference year. If the inventory-based estimates are

adjusted for the loss of natural carbon, a very likely total increase in 
storage between 1994 and 2007 of 24–34 Pg C, or around 25% of 
total emissions, is found (Gruber, 2019).
Thus, there is very high conﬁdence from surface ocean and ocean interior 
carbon data that the strength of the ocean sink for anthropogenic 
carbon has increased in the last two decades in response to the 
growth of atmospheric CO2. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that 
it is very likely that the ocean has taken up 20–30% of the global 
emissions of CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, cement production, 
and land-use change since the mid 1980s. The consistency between 
independent surface ocean observations and the ocean interior data-
based reconstructions supports the assessment of very high conﬁdence 
and provides robust evidence that fraction of emissions taken up by the 
ocean has not changed in a statistically signiﬁcant manner in the last 
few decades and remains consistent with AR5.
Alongside a globally integrated perspective, these new surface ocean 
observations also reveal a substantial degree of variability at interannual 
and decadal scales (Rödenbeck et al. 2015; Landschützer et al. 2016; 
Le Quéré et al. 2018). Most notable are the air-sea CO2 ﬂux variations 
in the tropics linked to ENSO variations (Rödenbeck  et  al.  2015; 
Landschützer et al. 2016), as well as the strong decadal variations 
in the high latitudes, especially the Southern Ocean (Landschützer 
et al. 2015; Munro et al. 2015; Ritter et al. 2017), discussed further in 
Chapter 3 (Section 3.2.1.2.4). Fluctuations in the Southern Ocean CO2 
ﬂux are important as they impart a substantial imprint also on the 
global uptake ﬂuxes. For instance, reduced Southern Ocean uptake in 
the 1990–2000 period coincided with an exceptionally weak global 
net uptake of only about 0.8 ± 0.5 Pg C yr−1.
Thus, there is growing evidence from multiple datasets that the 
ocean carbon sink exhibits decadal variability at regional scales that 
signiﬁcantly alter the globally integrated sink (medium conﬁdence).
Detailed analyses of the spatial structure of the change in storage of 
anthropogenic CO2 conﬁrm the variable nature of the ocean carbon 
sink suggested by the surface observations (Pérez et  al. 2013), 
which are most likely a consequence of changes in ocean circulation 
(DeVries and Weber, 2017). The increase in anthropogenic CO2 
between 1994 and 2007 occurs throughout the upper 1000 m, but 
with very different penetration depths, reﬂecting largely differences 
in the efﬁciency, with which the anthropogenic CO2 is transported 
from the surface to depth (Gruber et  al. 2019) (Figure 5.7). This

spatial distribution of how the amount of anthropogenic CO2 has 
changed between 1994 and 2007 is similar to the distribution of 
anthropogenic CO2 reconstructed for 1994 (Sabine et  al. 2004), 
although the imprint of regional variations in ocean circulation and 
transport are discernible (Gruber, 2019).
5.2.2.3.2 Ocean carbon chemistry
Analyses of direct measurements of ocean chemistry from time series 
stations and merged shipboard studies show consistent decreases 
in surface-ocean pH over the past few decades. Reductions range 
between 0.013–0.03 pH units decade–1 over records that span up 
to 25 years (Table SM5.3). Focusing on the individual time series 
locations with records longer than 15 years, there is an overall decline 
of 0.017–0.027 (across 99% conﬁdence intervals). Trends calculated 
from repeat measurements on ocean surveys show a consistent 
value of around –0.02 pH units decade–1 for diverse oceanic regions 
(Table SM5.3), with greater subsurface than surface trends reported 
in the subtropical oceans (Dore et al. 2009). At larger spatial scales, 
surface-ocean pH trends are assessed using shipboard observations 
of the fugacity of CO2 and estimates of ocean alkalinity (Takahashi 
et  al. 2014; Lauvset et  al. 2015). Between 1991–2011, mean 
surface-ocean pH has declined by 0.018 ± 0.004 units decade–1 in 
70% of ocean biomes, with the largest declines in the Indian Ocean 
(–0.027  units decade–1), eastern Equatorial Paciﬁc (–0.026 units 
decade–1) and the South Paciﬁc subtropical (–0.022 units decade–1) 
biomes (Lauvset et al. 2015). Due to the close link between carbonate 
ion concentrations and pH, mean trends in the stability of mineral 
forms of aragonite and calcite (known as the ‘saturation state’) that 
are important for organisms such as coccolithophorids, pteropods 
and corals follow those of pH, with high-latitude regions most 
vulnerable to under-saturation due to naturally lower mean values.
It is virtually certain that ocean pH is declining, and the very likely 
range of this decline is 0.017–0.027 pH units per decade for the 
8  locations where individual time series observations longer than 
15 years exist. This trend is lowering the chemical stability of 
mineral forms of calcium carbonate and can be attributed to rising 
atmospheric CO2 levels.
CMIP5 models are in good agreement with historical observations 
of declining surface-ocean pH (Figure 5.8a). Models project global 
surface-ocean declines between 2006–2015 and 2081–2100 of 
0.287–0.291 and 0.036–0.042 pH units (both across 99% conﬁdence 
intervals) for the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, with 
higher reductions in the subsurface of subtropical oceans (Bopp 
et  al. 2013; Gattuso et  al. 2015). These changes in pH will be 
greatest in the Arctic Ocean and the high latitudes of the Atlantic 
and Paciﬁc Oceans due to their lower buffer capacity and are lowest 
in contemporary upwelling systems (Figure 5.8b) and will also 
reduce the stability of calcite minerals (Bopp et al. 2013; Gattuso 
et al. 2015). The area of the surface ocean (0–10 m) characterised by 
undersaturated conditions in CMIP5 models by 2081–2100 reduces 
from a very likely range of 6.4–9.5 × 1012 m2 or 5.5–7.3 × 1013 m2 
under  RCP8.5 (as much as 16–20% of ocean surface area for 
aragonite), to just 0.01–0.2 × 1012 m2 or 0.01–0.13  ×  1013  m2 
under RCP2.6 for either calcite or aragonite minerals, respectively. 
Under RCP8.5, hotspots for undersaturated waters for calcite remain 
restricted to the Arctic Ocean, while for aragonite, much of the 
Southern Ocean and the North Paciﬁc and Northwestern Atlantic 
Oceans are also projected to become undersaturated (Orr et  al. 
2005; Hauri et al. 2015; Sasse et al. 2015). These results arise from 
the very well understood reductions in carbonate ion concentrations 
at lower pH, the vulnerability of regions with naturally low mean 
values, and the greater overall sensitivity of aragonite solubility. 
Regional models, with higher resolution that ESMs, also project 
year-round corrosive conditions for aragonite in some eastern 
boundary upwelling systems (Franco et  al. 2018a). In the ocean 
interior, the decline in pH and calcium carbonate saturation state is 
more uncertain across models (Steiner et al. 2014) as it is modulated 
by changes to ocean overturning and water mass subduction 
(Resplandy et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2017). Projected benthic changes 
in pH over the next century are highly localised and are linked to 
transport of surface anomalies to depth, with over 20% of the north 
Atlantic sea ﬂoor deeper than 500 m projected to experience pH 
reductions greater than 0.2 units by 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario 
(Gehlen et al. 2014). Changes in pH in the abyssal ocean (>3000 m 
deep) are greatest in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, with lesser 
impact in the Southern and Paciﬁc Oceans by 2100, mainly due to 
the circulation timescales (Sweetman et al. 2017).
Overall, it is virtually certain that the future surface open ocean will 
experience pH drops of either 0.036–0.042 (RCP2.6) or 0.287–0.291 
(RCP8.5) pH units by 2081–2100, relative to 2006–2105. These 
pH changes are very likely to cause 16–20% of the surface ocean, 
speciﬁcally the Arctic and Southern Oceans, as well as the northern 
Paciﬁc and northwestern Atlantic Oceans, to experience year-round 
corrosive conditions for aragonite by 2081–2100. It is virtually 
certain these impacts will be avoided under the RCP2.6 scenario. 
There is medium conﬁdence, due to the potential for parallel changes 
in ocean circulation, that the Arctic and north Atlantic seaﬂoors will 
experience the largest pH changes over the next century.
Although ocean acidiﬁcation results in long-term trends in mean ocean 
chemistry, it can also inﬂuence seasonal cycles. Observation-based 
products indicate that the seasonal cycle of global surface-ocean 
pCO2 increased in amplitude by 2.2 ± 0.4 μatm between 1982 and 
2014 (Landschützer et  al. 2018). CMIP5 models and data-based 
products similarly project consistent future increases in the seasonal 
cycle of surface-ocean pCO2 under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, 
with enhanced ampliﬁcation in high-latitude waters (McNeil and 
Sasse, 2016). The amplitude of the seasonal cycle of global surface-
ocean free acidity ([H+]) is projected to increase by 71–91% (across 
90% conﬁdence intervals) over the 21st century under RCP8.5, also 
with greater ampliﬁcation in the high-latitudes (Kwiatkowski and Orr, 
2018). Conversely, models project a 12–20% reduction (across 90% 
conﬁdence intervals) in the seasonal amplitude of surface-ocean 
pH, as changes in pH represent relative changes in [H+] due to their 
logarithmic relationship, and there are typically greater projected 
increases in annual mean state [H+] than the seasonal amplitude of 
[H+]. Models also project a 4–14% (across 90% conﬁdence intervals) 
reduction in the seasonal amplitude of global mean surface-ocean 
aragonite saturation state under RCP8.5, with a slight ampliﬁcation 
in the subtropics being outweighed by dampening elsewhere.

The  contrasting changes in the seasonal amplitudes of ocean 
carbonate chemistry variables derive from different sensitivities to 
atmospheric CO2 and climate change and to diverging trends in the 
seasonal cycles of DIC, alkalinity and temperature. Model skill at 
simulating the seasonal cycles of carbonate chemistry is moderate, 
with persistent biases in the Southern Ocean, particularly for pCO2, 
[H+] and pH (Kwiatkowski and Orr, 2018; Mongwe et al. 2018).
Overall, we assess that alongside the strong mean state changes, it 
is very likely that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in free acidity 
will increase by 71–91%, while it is very likely that the seasonal 
cycles of pH and aragonite saturation will decrease by 12–20% and 
4–14%, respectively.

5.2.2.4 
Changing Ocean Oxygen
Ocean oxygen (O2) levels at the surface are controlled by the balance 
between oxygen production during photosynthesis, temperature-
controlled solubility and air-sea exchange. Deeper in the water 
column, consumption of oxygen during respiration and redistribution 
by ocean circulation and mixing are dominant processes. In theory, 
a warmer more stratiﬁed ocean would have a reduced oxygen 
content, due to the combined inﬂuence of lowered gas solubility 
and a greater interior respiration of organic matter due to enhanced 
physical isolation of subsurface waters. In accord, global changes in 
ocean oxygen assessed from three different analyses of compiled 
global oxygen datasets going back to the 1960s agree that there is 
a net loss of oxygen from the ocean over all depths (see Table 5.2). 
For the 0–1000 m depth stratum that contains the most data and is 
common to all three analyses, oxygen is assessed to have declined 
by a very likely range of 0.5–3.3% between 1970 and 2010. For the 
surface ocean (0–100 m) and the thermocline later of 100–600 m 
the very likely range of oxygen declines are 0.2–2.1% and 0.7–3.5%, 
respectively (Table 5.2). Across two studies, global oxygen is assessed 
to have declined by a very likely range of 0.3–2.0%, with a similar 
range of decline for waters deeper than 600 m (Table 5.2). The 
regions of lowest oxygen, known as OMZs, with oxygen levels lower 
than 80 mmol L–1), are observed to be expanding by a very likely 
range of 3.0–8.3% across the three studies.
Regionally, all studies agree that the north Paciﬁc and Southern 
Oceans have shown the largest overall oxygen declines (Figure 5.9), 
but there is some disagreement regarding the magnitude of the 
oxygen change in the tropical ocean, with some studies suggesting 
signiﬁcant declines (Schmidtko et  al. 2017) and other reporting 
more modest reductions (Helm et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2017) and data 
coverage is still limited for some regions and deeper than 1000 m. 
Based on the available data, the strongest declines in deep ocean 
oxygen have occurred in the Equatorial Paciﬁc, North Paciﬁc, 
Southern Ocean and South Atlantic, with intermediate declines in 
the Arctic, South Paciﬁc and Equatorial Atlantic, while the north 
Atlantic has experienced a moderate oxygen increase below 1200 m 
(Figure 5.9). A particular difference between parallel oxygen analyses 
concerns the means of integrating and mapping sparse data across 
the ocean, both horizontally and vertically, with different studies 
making speciﬁc decisions about averaging grids and integration 
methods. Moreover, data remains sparse for some ocean regions, 
depths and periods. Taken together, the challenges of data sparsity, 
regional differences and the relatively large uncertainties on the 
oxygen changes across different studies, but also recognising that 
oxygen declines are signiﬁcantly different to zero, leads to medium 
conﬁdence in the observed oxygen decline.
Syntheses of datasets from local time series tend to document 
stronger trends, with oxygen declines of over 20% at sites in the 
northeastern Paciﬁc between 1956–2006 (Whitney et  al. 2007), 
the Northwestern Paciﬁc between 1954–2014 (Sasano et al. 2015) 
and the California Current between 1984–2011 (Bograd et  al. 
2015). Despite holding the highest inventory of oxygen in the 
ocean, oxygen levels in Southern Ocean contributed 25% to the 
global decline between 1970–1992 (Helm et  al. 2011) and have 
fallen by over 150  Tmol per decade from the 1960s to present 
(Schmidtko et al. 2017). Observations along ocean cruises as part 
of the CLIVAR programme have also documented broad thermocline 
oxygen declines in the northern hemisphere oceans, accompanied 
by well understood oxygen increases in subtropical and southern 
hemispheres (Talley et al. 2016).
Overall there is medium conﬁdence that the oxygen content of 
the upper 1000 m has declined with a very likely loss of 0.5–3.3% 
between 1970–2010. OMZ are expanding in volume, by a very likely 
range of 3.0–8.3%. There is medium conﬁdence that the largest 
regional changes have occurred in the Southern Ocean, equatorial 
regions, North Paciﬁc and South Atlantic due to medium agreement 
among studies.
The role of ocean warming alone in driving the oxygen changes can 
be appraised using solubility estimates, which vary between around 
15–50% for the upper 1000 m oxygen trend between studies (Helm 
et al. 2011; Ito et al. 2017; Schmidtko et al. 2017). The role of other 
processes, linked to changing ocean ventilation and respiration are 
challenging to appraise directly, but tend to reinforce the impacts 
from warming and are probably predominant overall (Oschlies 
et al. 2018). Indeed, that the observed oxygen decline is negatively 
correlated with ocean heat content changes (Ito et al. 2017) reﬂects 
the overriding role of changing ocean ventilation and associated 
processes (see also Section 5.2.2). That the ratio of the associated 
oxygen to heat changes is larger than would be expected from thermal 
processes alone also highlights the role played by other processes 
(Oschlies et al. 2018). Local oxygen trends have emphasised the role 
of changes to ocean physics in western Northern Paciﬁc (Whitney 
et al. 2013); Sasano et al. (2015), the southern California Current 
region (Goericke et al. 2015), and the Santa Barbara Basin (Goericke 
et al. 2015). In regions of high mesoscale activity, such as the tropical 
north Atlantic, low oxygen eddies can have a signiﬁcant impact 
on oxygen dynamics (Karstensen et al. 2015; Grundle et al. 2017). 
Oxygen ﬂuctuations in the deep ocean have been linked to changes 
in large scale ocean circulation (Watanabe et al. 2003; Stendardo 
and Gruber, 2012) and at the global scale, the observed oxygen 
decline is negatively correlated with ocean heat content changes (Ito 
et al. 2017). Changes to respiration rates, either due to temperature 
enhancement or in the amount/quality of organic material can also 
be important and the enhanced respiratory demand associated with 
an intensiﬁed monsoon has been invoked as a driver of the expansion 
of the Arabian Sea OMZ (Lachkar et al. 2018).
Ocean oxygen changes are also affected by climate variability on 
interannual and decadal timescales, especially for the tropical ocean 
OMZs (Deutsch et al. 2011). ENSO variability in particular affects the 
thermocline structure, which then alongside changes in circulation 
modulates oxygen solubility and respiratory demand in this region 
(Ito and Deutsch, 2013; Eddebbar et al. 2017). These drivers may then 
be combined with modiﬁcations to overturning and ventilation of 
OMZs by lateral jets and equatorial current intensity (Duteil et al. 
2014). Centennial scale studies based on isotope proxies for low 
oxygen regions have demonstrated ﬂuctuations in OMZ extent linked 
to decadal changes in tropical trade winds that affects interior ocean 
respiratory oxygen demand, which implies that it will be difﬁcult 
472
Chapter 5 
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities
5
to attribute recent changes in the Paciﬁc OMZ to anthropogenic 
forcing alone (Deutsch et al. 2015). Parallel work based on oxygen 
observations (Llanillo et al. 2013), as well as modelling (Duteil et al. 
2018) supports the importance of decadal scale variability in the 
eastern tropical Paciﬁc OMZ. There is some evidence for the potential 
of a modulating impact on tropical Paciﬁc oxygen at interannual 
timescales from atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and iron 
(Ito et al. 2016; Yang and Gruber, 2016).
At the global scale, there is high conﬁdence that the impact of 
a warmer ocean on oxygen levels is reinforced by other processes 
associated with ocean physics and biogeochemistry, which cause 
the majority of the observed oxygen decline. For the tropical Paciﬁc 
OMZ, there is medium conﬁdence arising from medium agreement 
from medium evidence that low frequency decadal changes in ocean 
physics have controlled past ﬂuctuations in OMZ extent. 
Future changes in oxygen can be appraised from ESMs that account 
for the combined effects of ocean physics and biogeochemistry. 
Globally, these models project that it is very likely oxygen will decline 
by 3.2–3.7% or 1.6–2.0% (both across 90% conﬁdence limits) for 
RCP8.5 or RCP2.6, respectively, relative to 2000 (Bopp et al. 2013). 
Focussing on the 100–600 m depth stratum, O2 changes by –4 to 
–3.1% for the RCP8.5 or by –0.5–0.1% for the RCP2.6 scenario 
(relative to 2006–2015, Figure 5.8d). It should be noted that ESMs 
appear to be underestimating the rate of oxygen change from 
available datasets from the historical period (Oschlies et al. 2018). 
Increased tropical ocean stratiﬁcation reduces interior ocean oxygen 
by diminishing pathways of ventilation in the subtropical gyres 
and by inhibiting turbulent mixing with the oxygen-rich surface 
ocean (see Section 5.2.2.2.4). This relatively robust global modelled 
trend (Figure 5.8d) however masks important uncertainties in the 
projection of regional trends (Figure 5.8e), particularly in the tropical 
ocean OMZs (Bopp et al. 2013; Cocco et al. 2013; Cabré et al. 2015). 
The uncertainty in the trends in tropical ocean OMZs arises due to 
the fact that oxygen depletion due to warming induced reductions in 
oxygen saturation are opposed by oxygen enrichment due to reduced 
oxygen consumption during respiration in response to predicted 
declines in marine export production, as well as biases due to model 
resolution in the tropics and the length of the model spin up (Bopp 
et al. 2017). The 80 mmol L–1 threshold that may be used to deﬁne 
the volume of the oxygen minimum is projected to grow by a very 
likely range of 7.0 ± 5.6% by 2100 during the RCP8.5 scenario or 
show virtually no change during the RCP2.6 scenario, relative to 
Table 5.2 |  Observed oxygen changes for the period 1970–2010 for 6 different layers within the ocean. The changes are shown as percentage change of global averages. 
The layers are depths 0–100, 100–600, 0–1000, and 600–bottom are in metres. The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is deﬁned as the ocean volume change that is less than 
80 mmol L–1. The estimates and conﬁdence intervals are based published papers (Schmidtko et al. 2018, Ito et al. 2017 and Helm et al. 2011). The assessed change is the 
average of the available estimates and the 90% Conﬁdence Interval (CI) combines the conﬁdence as their standard deviation with two degrees of freedom.

a 1850–1900 reference period (Figure 5.10). At the seaﬂoor, between 
200–3000 m depth strata, the north Paciﬁc, north Atlantic, Arctic and 
Southern Oceans may see oxygen declines by 0.3–3.7% by 2100 
(relative to 2005), with abyssal ocean changes being lower and more 
localised around regions in the north Atlantic and Southern Ocean 
(Sweetman et al. 2017), but will be modulated by any future changes 
in overturning strength. There is high conﬁdence that the largest 
changes in deep sea systems will occur after 2100 (Battaglia and 
Joos, 2018). 
Simulations extended to 2300 suggest that by 2150 the trend of 
declining tropical ocean oxygen (both in terms of concentrations 
and volume of low oxygen waters) may reverse itself, mainly due 
to the effect of strong declines in primary production and organic 
matter ﬂuxes to the ocean interior (Fu et al. 2018) or due to enhanced 
Antarctic ventilation (Yamamoto et al. 2015), but with low conﬁdence 
due to limited evidence. At the global scale, 10,000 year intermediate 
complexity model simulations ﬁnd that overall ocean oxygen loss 
shows near linear relationships to equilibrium temperature, itself 
linearly related to cumulative emissions, and any climate mitigation 
scenario will reduce peak oxygen loss by 4.4% per degree Celsius of 
avoided warming (Battaglia and Joos, 2018). 
In summary, the total oxygen content of the ocean is very likely to 
decline by 3.2–3.7% by 2100, relative to 2000, for RCP8.5 or by 
between 1.6–2.0% for RCP2.6 with medium conﬁdence. There is 
medium conﬁdence that sea ﬂoor changes will be more localised 
in the north Atlantic and Southern Oceans by 2100, but high 
conﬁdence that the largest deep sea ﬂoor changes in oxygen will 
occur after 2100.
5.2.2.5 
Changing Ocean Nutrients 
Changes to ocean nutrient cycling are driven by modiﬁcations to ocean 
mixing and transport (Section 5.2.2.2.2), internal biogeochemical 
cycling and ﬂuctuations in external supply, particularly from rivers 
and the atmosphere. This assessment will focus on the main nutrients 
important for driving microbial growth (Section 5.2.2.6), namely 
nitrogen, phosphorus and iron. 
Diverse studies (including shipboard experiments and use of protein 
biomarkers) have highlighted nitrogen and phosphorus limitation in 
the stratiﬁed tropical ocean regions accompanied by widespread iron 
limitation at high latitudes and in upwelling regions that typically 
have elevated levels of productivity (Figure 5.11) (Moore et  al. 
2013; Saito et al. 2014; Browning et al. 2017; Tagliabue et al. 2017). 
Moreover, more extensive experimental work has demonstrated 
overlapping nitrogen-iron co-limitation at the boundaries between 
gyre and upwelling regimes (Browning et  al. 2017). There is high 
conﬁdence arising from robust evidence and high agreement across 
different types of studies that the main limiting nutrient is either iron 
(in most major upwelling regions and the Southern, north Atlantic 
and sub-Arctic Paciﬁc Oceans) or nitrogen and phosphorus (in the 
low productivity tropical ocean gyres).
There is limited evidence on contemporary trends in nutrient levels, 
either from time series sites or broader meta-analyses. Increasing 
inputs of anthropogenic nitrogen from the atmosphere are 
perturbing ocean nutrient levels (Jickells et al. 2017). In the North 
Paciﬁc in particular, additional atmospheric nitrogen input has raised 
the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio between 1988–2011 and induced 
a progressive shift towards phosphorus limitation in this region 
(Kim et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2014; Ren et al. 2017). This tendency is 
supported by modelling experiments that ﬁnd enhanced atmospheric 
nitrogen input only has a small inﬂuence on productivity due to 
expanded phosphorus limitation (Yang and Gruber, 2016) and other 
nitrogen cycle feedbacks (Somes et al. 2016; Landolﬁ et al. 2017).
In general, future increases in stratiﬁcation (Dave and Lozier, 2013; 
Talley et al. 2016; Kwiatkowski et al. 2017; and see also Section 5.2.2.2) 
will trap nutrients in the ocean interior and reduce upper ocean 
nutrient levels, alongside an additional local impact from changes 
to atmospheric delivery. However, no CMIP5 models accounted for 
changes in nutrient delivery from dust and anthropogenic aerosols 
during their experiments, which could be an important component 
of regional change (Wang et al. 2015b; Somes et al. 2016; Yang and 
Gruber, 2016). ESMs project a decline in the nitrate content of the 
upper 100 m of 9–14% or 1.5–6% (across 90% conﬁdence intervals) 
for the RCP8.5 or RCP2.6 scenario, respectively, by 2081–2100 relative 
to 2006–2015 (Figure 5.8g). The largest absolute declines in nitrate 
content is projected in the present day upwelling zones (Figure 5.8h). 
Projected changes to upper 100 m nitrate concentrations are 
signiﬁcantly different to zero for both RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 at the 90% 
conﬁdence level, but are overall lower for the RCP2.6. Scenario, internal 
variability and inter-model variability contribute roughly equally to the 
overall projection uncertainty in 2100 (Figure 5.8i) and there is no clear 
separation of nitrate trends between RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 outside the 
model uncertainty (Figure 5.8h).

Iron concentrations are projected to increase in the future from ESM 
simulations, due to enhanced lateral transport into high-latitude 
oceans and reduced biological consumption in regions of declining 
nitrate (Misumi et  al. 2013). Other modelling efforts also suggest 
greater levels of the more biologically available Fe(II) species in 
a warmer and more acidic ocean (Tagliabue and Völker, 2011). These 
modelling studies tend to indicate greater ocean iron availability in 
the future overall, but the very limited skill of contemporary global 
ocean iron models in reproducing observations available from the 
new basin scale datasets from the international GEOTRACES program 
and neglect for parallel dust supply changes lower the conﬁdence in 
the models’ projected changes (Tagliabue et al. 2016). 
Overall, nitrate concentrations in the upper 100 m are very likely to 
decline by 9–14% by 2081–2100, relative to 2006–2015 for RCP8.5 
or 1.5–6% for RCP2.6, in response to increased stratiﬁcation, with 
medium conﬁdence in these projections due to the limited evidence 
of past changes that can be robustly understood and reproduced 
by models. Surface ocean iron levels is projected to increase in the 
21st century with low conﬁdence due to systemic uncertainties in 
these models. 
5.2.2.6 
Changing Ocean Primary and Export Production
Ocean primary productivity is a key process in the ocean carbon 
cycle (see Section 5.2.2.3), as well as for supporting pelagic ocean 
ecosystems (see Section 5.2.3). NPP is the product of phytoplankton 
growth rate and standing stock. Phytoplankton growth is controlled 
by the combination of temperature, light and nutrients, while 
the phytoplankton standing stock is modiﬁed by both gains from 
growth and losses due to grazing by zooplankton (Figure 5.12). 
Export production is here deﬁned as the sinking ﬂux of particulate 
organic carbon (produced by NPP) across a speciﬁed depth horizon. 
Otherwise known as the biological pump, export production is also 
a key component of the global carbon cycle (see Section 5.2.2.3) and 
an essential food supply to benthic organisms (see Section 5.2.3.2). 
Export production is regulated by the level of primary production 
and the transfer efﬁciency with depth, itself controlled by the type 
of sinking organic carbon, which is affected by the upper ocean food 
web structure (Boyd et al. 2019). 
Satellite datasets that use mathematical algorithms to convert 
ocean colour, often alongside other remotely sensed information, 
into chlorophyll or other indexes of phytoplankton biomass and NPP 
provide the potential to deliver a global meta-analysis of changes 
in NPP. Since AR5, a variety of studies have reported relatively 
insigniﬁcant changes in overall open ocean chlorophyll levels of 
<±1% yr–1 for individual time periods (Boyce et al. 2014; Gregg and 
Rousseaux, 2014; Boyce and Worm, 2015; Hammond et al. 2017). 
Regionally, trends of ±4% between 2002–2015 for different regions 
are found when different satellite products are merged, with increases 
at high latitudes and moderate decreases at low latitudes (Mélin 
et al. 2017). While some studies report good comparability of merged 
products (Mélin et al. 2017), others highlight signiﬁcant mismatches

regarding absolute values and decadal trends in NPP between NPP 
algorithms (Gómez-Letona et al. 2017). Satellite derived NPP shows 
signiﬁcant mismatches when compared to in situ data and reducing 
uncertainties in derived NPP is a high priority for the community 
(Lee et al. 2015), although there is a reasonable correlation in higher 
biomass coastal regions (Kahru et  al. 2009). Importantly, satellite 
records are not yet long enough to unambiguously isolate long term 
climate related trends from natural variability (Beaulieu et al. 2013). 
Overall, there is low conﬁdence in satellite-based trends in global 
ocean NPP due to the time series length and lack of corroborating in 
situ measurements or other validation time series. This is especially 
true at regional scales where distinct sets of poorly understood 
processes dominate. 
Future changes in NPP will result from the changing inﬂuence from 
temperature, light, nutrients and grazing (Figure 5.12). Across CMIP 
models, NPP is predicted to broadly decline or remain constant 
by 2081–2100, with mean changes by 2100 of –3.8 to –10.6% 
and –1.1–0.8% across 90% conﬁdence intervals for the RCP85 
and RCP26 scenario, respectively (all relative to 2006–2015), with 
a  strong degree of regional symmetry (Figure 5.8k). As seen for 
nitrate, changes are most marked in low-latitude upwelling regions, 
which are projected to show the largest absolute declines. As for 
nitrate, projected NPP changes are lower for the RCP26 scenario 
(Figure 5.8j), but the overall uncertainty is dominated by internal 
and inter-model variability in 2100 (Figure 5.8l) which results in 
no clear separation of NPP trends between the RCP85 and RCP26 
(Figure 5.8j). Tropical ocean NPP is projected to show a large decline, 
but is underpinned by substantial intermodal uncertainty, with mean 
changes of 11 ± 24% across the suite of CMIP5 models by 2100, 
relative to 2000 under RCP8.5 (Laufkötter et al. 2015). However, if 
emergent constraints from the historical record that link the variability 
of tropical productivity to temperature anomalies then a four-fold 
decline in inter-model uncertainty results. This leads to a projected 
tropical ocean decline of 11 ± 6%, or from 6.8–16.2% across 90% 
conﬁdence limits, depending on which historical constraint is used 
(Kwiatkowski et al. 2017). NPP is projected to increases for higher 
latitude regions, such as the Arctic and Southern Oceans.
Detailed analyses of the interplay between different drivers of 
NPP, including temperature, light, nutrient levels and grazing 
from a subset of CMIP5 models, reveals a complex interplay with 
a strong latitudinal dependence (Laufkötter et al. 2015) summarised 
in Figure 5.12. Warming acts to enhance growth, most notably at 
lower latitudes, while light conditions are also predicted to improve, 
mostly at the poles. Nutrient limitation shows a much more complex 
response across models, but tends to increase in the tropics and 
northern high latitudes, with little change in the Southern Ocean. 
Taken together there is a tendency for reduced growth rates 
across the entire ocean, but there is a large amount of inter-model 
variability. The changes in growth are allied to a consistent increase 
in the grazing loss of biomass to upper trophic levels. Since AR5, we 
have an increasing body of literature concerning role of biological 
feedbacks, especially due to interactions between organisms, speciﬁc 
physiological responses and from upper trophic levels on nutrient 
concentrations, linked to variable food quality (Kwiatkowski et  al. 
2018), resource recycling (Boyd et al. 2015a; Tagliabue et al. 2017) 
and interactions between organisms (Lima-Mendez et  al. 2015), 
but their role in shaping the response of NPP to climate change 
remains a  major unknown. Lastly, modelling work suggests that 
the increasing deposition of anthropogenic aerosols (supplying N 
and Fe) stimulates biological activity (Wang et al. 2015b) and may 
compensate for warming driven reductions in primary productivity 
(Wang et al. 2015b), but these effects do not form part of the CMIP5 
projections assessed here.
CMIP5 models show a strong negative relationship between changes 
in stratiﬁcation that reduces net nutrient supply and integrated export 
production (Fu et al. 2016). Export production is projected to decline 
by 8.9–15.8% or 1.6–4.9% (across 90% conﬁdence intervals) by 
2100, relative to 2000 for the RCP8.5 or RCP2.6 scenario, respectively 
(Bopp et al. 2013; Fu et al. 2016; Laufkötter et al. 2016). The projected 
changes in export production can be larger than global primary 
production because they are affected by both the NPP changes, 
but also how shifts in food web structure modulates the ‘transfer 
efﬁciency’ of particulate organic material (Guidi et al. 2016; Tréguer 
et  al. 2018), which then affects the sinking speed and lability of 
exported particles through the ocean interior to the sea ﬂoor (Bopp 
et al. 2013; Fu et al. 2016; Laufkötter et al. 2016). Declines in export 
production over much of the ocean mean that the ﬂux arriving at 
the sea ﬂoor is also predicted to decline, while increases in export 
production are projected in the polar regions that see enhanced NPP 
(Sweetman et al. 2017). 
The realism in model projections can be appraised via their ability 
to accurately simulate the limiting nutrient in speciﬁc ocean 
regions (Figure 5.11), with high model skill in reproducing surface 
distributions of nitrate and phosphate (Laufkötter et  al. 2015), 
raising conﬁdence in projections in nitrogen and phosphorus limited 
systems, but poor skill in reproducing iron distributions (Tagliabue 
et al. 2016) lowering conﬁdence in iron limited regions (Figure 5.11). 
In addition to concentrations of speciﬁc nutrients, the response of 
NPP to environmental change is strongly controlled by accurate 
representation of the ratio of resources (Moreno et al. 2017). Overall 
CMIP5 models skill in reproducing patterns of NPP and export 
production from limited satellite derived estimates range from 
poor to average (correlation coefﬁcients of 0.1–0.6 across different 
models (Laufkötter et al. 2016; Moreno et al. 2017)), but it should be 
noted that complete comprehensive observational datasets do not 
exist for these metrics with very few in situ observations. As export 
production is a much better understood net integral of changing net 
nutrient supply (Sarmiento and Gruber, 2002) and can be constrained 
by interior ocean nutrient and oxygen levels, there is medium 
conﬁdence in these projections for global changes. Improving the 
ability of models to reproduce historical NPP is crucial for more 
accurate projections as model biases in simulating contemporary 
ocean biogeochemistry play a key role in driving future projections 
(Fu et al. 2016). 
Overall, these assessments balance the range of projections across 
models alongside the strength of different kinds of observational 
constraints available, as well as our theoretical or experimental 
understanding of the impact of a warmer, more stratiﬁed ocean on 
NPP and export production. As for AR5, net primary productivity

is very likely to decline by 4–11% by 2081–2100, relative to 
1850–1900, across CMIP5 models for RCP8.5, but there is low 
conﬁdence for this estimate due to the medium agreement 
among models and the limited evidence from observations. It is 
very likely that tropical NPP will decline by 7–16% by 2100 for 
RCP8.5 with medium conﬁdence, as there are improved constraints 
from historical variability in this region. Globally, the increased 
stratiﬁcation in the future is very likely to reduce export production 
by 9–16% in response to reduced nutrient supply, especially in 
tropical regions (medium conﬁdence).

Box 5.1 |  Time of Emergence and Exposure to Climate Hazards 
The concept of time of emergence (ToE) is deﬁned as the time at which the signal of climate change in a given variable emerges 
from a measure of the background variability or noise (SROCC Glossary). In associating a calendar date with the detection, attribution 
and projection of climate trends, the concept of a ToE has proved useful for policy and planning particularly through informing 
important climatic thresholds and the uncertainties associated with past and future climate change (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012). 
However, there is not a single agreed metric and the ToE for a given variable thus depends on choices regarding the space and time 
scale, the threshold at which emergence is deﬁned and the reference period (IPCC 5th Asseessment Report (AR5) Working Group 
I (WGI) Section 11.3.2.1). Recently, the ToE concept has been expanded to consider variables related to climatic hazards to marine 
organisms and ecosystems such as pH, carbonate ion concentrations, aragonite and calcite saturation states, nutrient levels and 
marine primary productivity (Box 5.1, Figure 1) (Ilyina et al. 2009; Friedrich et al. 2012; Keller et al. 2014b; Lovenduski et al. 2015; 
Rodgers et al. 2015). ToE assessments for the ocean typically quantify the internal variability using the standard deviation of the 
detrended data over a given time period (Keller et al. 2014b; Rodgers et al. 2015; Henson et al. 2016; Henson et al. 2017), the scenario 
and model uncertainty associated with different climate scenarios and across available ESMs (Frölicher et al. 2016), and in some cases 
the autocorrelation of noise (Weatherhead et al. 1998). As more components of ‘noise’ are accounted for, the ToE lengthens and the 
ToE is also affected by whether a control simulation or historical variability is used to determine the noise (Hameau et al. 2019). 
This assessment considers the ToE of hazards exposed to by marine organisms and ecosystems. These biological components of the 
ocean respond to climate hazards that emerge locally, rather than to the global and basin-scale averages reported in WGI AR5 (Stocker 
et al. 2013). Overall, ESMs show that there is an ordered emergence of the climate variables, with pH emerging rapidly across the 
entire open ocean, followed by sea surface temperature (SST), interior oxygen, upper ocean nutrient levels and ﬁnally NPP under 
both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6 and RCP8.5 relative to the 1861–1900 reference period (Box 5.1, Figure 1). 
Anthropogenic signals remain detectable for over large parts of the ocean even for the RCP2.6 scenario for pH and SST, but are likely 
lowered for nutrients and NPP in the 21st century. For example, for the open ocean, the anthropogenic pH signal in Earth System 
Models (ESM) historical simulations is very likely to have emerged for three-quarters of the ocean prior to 1950 and it is very likely 
over 95% of the ocean has already been affected, with little discernable difference between scenarios. The climate signal of oxygen 
loss will very likely emerge from the historical climate by 2050 with a very likely range of 59–80% by 2031–2050 and rising with a 
very likely range of 79–91% of the ocean area by 2081–2100 (RCP8.5 emissions scenario). The emergence of oxygen loss is smaller 
in area under RCP2.6 scenario in the 21st century and by 2090 the emerged area is declining (Henson et al. 2017) (Box 5.1 Figure 1). It 
has also been shown that changes to oxygen solubility or utilisation may emerge earlier than bulk oxygen levels (Hameau et al. 2019).
It must be noted that variability will be greater in the coastal ocean than for the open ocean, which will be important for both hazard 
exposure for coastal species and the detection of trends. For example, although signals of anthropogenic inﬂuences have already 
emerged from internal variability in the late 20th century for global and basin-scale averaged ocean surface and sub-surface temperature 
(very likely) (AR5 WGI Summary for Policymakers), their ToE and level of conﬁdence vary greatly at local scales and in coastal seas 
(Frölicher et al. 2016). Pelagic organisms with small range size may thus be more (or less) at risk to warming with earlier (or later) 
ToE at the scale of the area that they inhabit. From an observational standpoint, analyses that account for autocorrelation of noise 
suggest time series of around a decade are sufﬁcient to detect a trend in pH or SST, whereas datasets spanning 30 years or longer are 
typically needed for detection of emergence at local scales for oxygen, nitrate and primary productivity (Henson et al. 2016). 
The rapidity of change and its geographic scope, encompassed in the ToE, can be linked to concepts of exposure to hazard and 
vulnerability of biota. As organisms have evolved to be adaptable to natural variations in the environmental conditions of their 
habitats, changes to their habitat conditions larger than that typically experienced or speciﬁc biological thresholds such as upper 
temperature or oxygen tolerance may become hazardous (Mora et al. 2013). This would then move from the statistical nature of 
the ‘detection and attribution’ nature of the ToE discussed above towards timescales of impacts on organisms useful for ecosystem 
projections. In doing so, it will be important to think about the differences in habitat suitability between different organisms, including 
their speciﬁc thresholds for speciﬁc drivers, for example, temperature, oxygen or calcium carbonate stability. Further, thresholds vary 
depending on habitat, for example, warming thresholds for coral bleaching (Pendleton et al. 2016) may differ from the temperature 
and oxygen thresholds for ﬁshes such as Atlantic cod and tunas (Deutsch et al. 2015). Moreover, species with fast generation 
times relative to the ToE of key habitat conditions (e.g., phytoplankton) may evolve more quickly to environmental change and be less 
vulnerable to climate change than longer-lived, slower generation time species (e.g., large sharks) (Jones and Cheung, 2018). However, 
evidence on evolutionary adaptation to expected climate change is limited, thus while shorter generation time may facilitate adaptation 
to environmental change, it does not necessarily result in successful adaptation of organisms (Section 5.2.3.1).

5.2.3 
Impacts on Pelagic Ecosystems 
Marine pelagic ecosystems (the water column extending from the 
surface ocean down to the deep sea ﬂoor) face increasing climate 
related hazards from the changing environmental conditions (see 
Section 5.2.2). WGII AR5 (Pörtner et al. 2014) concluded, as also 
conﬁrmed in Section 5.2.2, that long time series of more than 
three or four decades in length are necessary for determining 
biological trends in the ocean. However, long-term biological 
observations of pelagic ecosystems are rare and biased toward 
mid to high-latitude systems in the Northern Hemisphere (Edwards 
et  al. 2013; Poloczanska et  al. 2013; Poloczanska et  al. 2016). 
This assessment, therefore, combines multiple lines of evidence 
ranging from experiments, ﬁeld observations to model simulations 
to detect and attribute drivers of biological changes in the past, 
project future climate impacts and risks of pelagic ecosystems. In 
this section the pelagic ecosystem is subdivided into the surface, 
epipelagic ocean (<200 m, the uppermost part of the ocean that 
receives enough sunlight to allow photosynthesis) (Section 5.2.3.1) 
and the deep pelagic ocean, comprising the twilight, mesopelagic 
zone (200–1000 m) and the dark, bathypelagic zone (>1000 m 
deep) (Section 5.2.3.2). Although the WGII AR5 Chapter 30 deﬁned 
the deep sea as below 1000 m (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014), the 
absence of photosynthetically useful light and ensuing critical 
ecological, biogeochemical transformations, and altered human 
interactions that occur on much of the sea ﬂoor below 200 m have 
led both pelagic and benthic biologists to include the ocean waters 
and seaﬂoor below 200 m within the deﬁnition of the deep sea 
(Herring and Dixon, 1998; Gage, 2003).
5.2.3.1 
The Epipelagic Ocean
This section synthesises new evidence since AR5 to assess observed 
changes in relation to the effects of and the interactions between 
multiple climate and non-climate hazards, and to project future 
risks of impacts from these hazards on the epipelagic organisms, 
communities and food web interactions, and their scope and 
limitation to adapt. 
5.2.3.1.1 Detection and attribution of biological  
changes in the epipelagic ocean 
Temperature-driven shifts in distribution and phenology 
WGII AR5 concluded that the vulnerability of most organisms 
to warming is set by their physiology, which deﬁnes their limited 
temperature ranges and thermal sensitivity (Pörtner et  al. 2014). 
Although different hypotheses have been proposed since AR5 to 
explain the mechanism linking temperature sensitivity of marine 
organisms and their physiological tolerances (Schulte, 2015; Pörtner 
et  al. 2017; Somero et  al. 2017), evidence from physiological 
experiments and observations from paleo- and contemporary periods 
continue to support the conclusion from AR5 on the impacts of 
temperature change beyond thermal tolerance ranges on biological 
functions such as metabolism, growth and reproduction (Payne et al. 
2016; Pörtner and Gutt, 2016; Gunderson et al. 2017), contributing to 
changes in biogeography and community structure (Beaugrand et al. 
2015; Stuart-Smith et al. 2015) (high agreement, high conﬁdence). 
Comparison of biota across land and ocean suggests that marine 
species are generally inhabiting environment that is closer to their 
upper temperature limits, explaining the substantially higher rate of 
Box 5.1 (continued)
Earlier ToE and their subsequent biological impacts 
on organisms and ecosystems increase the urgency of policy 
responses through both climate mitigation and adaptation 
(Sections 5.5). However, the rapid emergence of hazards at 
the local scale in the near-term (already past or in this decade) 
such as warming and ocean acidiﬁcation and the resulting 
impacts on some of the more sensitivity or less adaptive 
biodiversity and ecosystem services may post challenges 
for international and regional policies as their often require 
multiple decades to designate and implement (Box 5.6). 
In contrast, scope for adaptation for national and local 
ocean governance can be more responsive to rapid changes 
(Sections 5.5.2, 5.5.3). This highlights the opportunities for 
multi-level adaptation that allows for reducing climate risks 
that are expected to emergence of stressors and impacts at 
different time frame (Mackenzie et al. 2014).

surface temperature (SST), surface pH, 100–600 m oxygen (O2), 0–100 m 
nitrate (NO3), and 0–100 m integrated net primary production (NPP). The 
year of emergence represents the year when the mean change relative to 
the reference period of 1861–1900 is above the standard deviation of each 
variable over the historical period (Frölicher et al. 2016) and is expressed 
here in terms of the rate at which different climate signals emerge as 
a  proportion of total ocean area for the Representative Concentration 
Pathway (RCP)8.5 scenario. The ﬁnal area (and standard deviation) by 2100 
under the RCP2.6 scenario is indicated by vertical lines at 2100.

local extirpation related to warming relative to those on land (Pinsky 
et al. 2019). Hypoxia and acidiﬁcation can also limit the temperature 
ranges of organisms and exacerbate their sensitivity to warming 
(Mackenzie et  al. 2014; Rosas-Navarro et  al. 2016; Pörtner et  al. 
2017), although interactions vary strongly between species and 
biological processes (Gobler and Baumann, 2016; Lefevre, 2016).
Shifts in distribution of marine species from phytoplankton to 
marine mammals continued to be observed since AR5 across all 
ocean regions (Poloczanska et al. 2016). Recent evidence continues 
to support that a large proportion of records of observed range 
shifts in the epipelagic ecosystem (Poloczanska et  al. 2016) are 
correlated with ocean temperature, with an estimated average shift 
in distribution (including range centroids, northward and southward 
boundaries) from these records of 51.5 ± 33.3 km per decade since 
the 1950s (Figure 5.13). Such rate of shift is signiﬁcantly faster 
than those records for organisms in the seaﬂoor; the latter has an 
average rate of distribution shift of 29.0 ± 15.5 km per decade 
(44% of the records for seaﬂoor species with range shifts that 
are consistent with expectation from the observed temperature 
changes) (very likely) (Figure 5.13). Comparison of global seaﬂoor-
derived planktonic foraminifera from pre-industrial age with recent 
(from year 1978) communities show that the recent assemblages 
differ from their pre-industrial with increasing dominance of warmer 
or cooler species that are mostly consistent with temperature 
changes (Jonkers et al. 2019). Rate of observed responses also varies 
between and within animal groups among ocean regions, with 
zooplankton and ﬁshes having faster recorded range shifts (Pinsky 
et al. 2013; Asch, 2015; Jones and Cheung, 2015; Poloczanska et al. 
2016). For example, analysis of the Continuous Plankton Recorder 
(CPR) data-series from the north Atlantic in the last decades shows 
that the range of dinoﬂagellates tended to closely track the velocity 
of climate change (the rate of isotherm movement). In contrast, the 
distribution range of diatoms shifted much more slowly (Chivers 
et  al. 2017) and its distribution seems to be primary inﬂuenced 
by multi-decadal variability rather than from secular temperature 
trends. The CPR surveys have also provided evidence that some 
calanoid copepods are expanding poleward in the Northeast 
Atlantic, at a rate up to 232 km per decade (Beaugrand, 2009; 
Chivers et  al. 2017), although different calanoid species respond 
differently in the rate and direction of shifts (Philippart et al. 2003; 
Edwards and Richardson, 2004; Asch, 2015; Crespo et  al. 2017). 
Overall, the observed changes in biogeography are consistent 
with expected responses to changes in ocean temperature for the 
majority of marine biota (high conﬁdence). This is also consistent 
with theories and experimental evidence that scale from individual 
organisms’ physiological responses to community level effects (high 
conﬁdence). Sensitivity of organisms’ biogeography varies between 
taxonomic groups (high conﬁdence). 
The rate and direction of observed range shifts are shaped by the 
interaction between climatic and non-climatic factors (Poloczanska 
et al. 2013; Sydeman et al. 2015; Poloczanska et al. 2016), such 
as local temperature and oxygen gradients in the habitat across 
depth (Cheung et  al. 2013; Deutsch et  al. 2015), latitude and 
longitude (Burrows et al. 2014; Barton et al. 2016), ocean currents 
(Sunday et al. 2015; Barton et al. 2016; García Molinos et al. 2017), 
bathymetry in all or part of their life stages (for organisms living on 
or close to the seaﬂoor) (Pinsky et al. 2013; Kleisner et al. 2015), 
geographical barriers (Pinsky et  al. 2013; Burrows  et  al.  2014), 
availability of food and critical habitat (Sydeman et  al. 2015), 
ﬁshing and other non-climatic human impacts (Engelhard et  al. 
2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 2014). Moreover, observed range 
shifts in respond to climate change in some regions such as the 
north Atlantic are strongly inﬂuenced by warming due to multi-
decadal variability (Edwards et  al. 2013; Harris et  al. 2014), 
suggesting that there is a longer time-of-emergence of range 
shifts from natural variability and a need for longer biological time 
series for robust attribution. The rate of shifts in biogeography 
of organism is inﬂuenced by multiple climatic and non-climatic 
factors (high conﬁdence) that can result in non-synchronous shifts 
in community composition (high conﬁdence).  There is general 
under-representation of biogeographical records in low latitudes 
(Dornelas et al. 2018), rendering detection and attribution of shifts 
in biogeography in these regions having medium conﬁdence. The 
variation in responses of marine biota to range shifts can cause 
spatial restructuring of the pelagic ecosystem with consequences 
for organisms at higher trophic levels (Chivers et al. 2017; Pecl et al. 
2017) (high conﬁdence). Marine ectotherms have demonstrated 
some capacity for physiological adjustment and evolutionary 
adaptation that lowers their sensitivity to warming and decrease in 
oxygen (Pörtner et al. 2014; Cavallo et al. 2015) (low conﬁdence). 
However, historical responses in abundance and ranges of marine 
species to ocean warming suggest that adaptation not always 
sufﬁces to mitigate projected impacts (WGII AR5 Chapter 6) 
(high conﬁdence). 
Marine reptiles, seabirds and mammals breathe air, instead of 
obtaining oxygen from water, and many of them spend some of 
their life cycle on land, being their abundance and distribution still 
affected by temperature (Pörtner et al. 2014). Long term population 
changes and shifts in distribution associated with climate change 
have been observed for temperate species of seabirds and marine 
mammals (Henderson et al. 2014; Hiscock and Chilvers, 2014; Ramp 
et  al. 2015) (high conﬁdence). For example, Laysan, Phoebastria 
immutabilis, and Wandering, Diomedea exulans, albatross have 
responded positively to climate change as they have been able 
to take advantage of the increased intensity of winds. This has 
allowed them to forage farther and faster, making their foraging 
trips shorter, increasing their foraging efﬁciency and breeding 
success (Descamps et  al. 2015; Thorne et  al. 2016). For reptiles, 
like sea turtles and snakes, temperature directly affects important 
life history traits including hatchling size, sex, viability and 
performance (high conﬁdence) (Hays et al. 2003; Pike, 2014; Dudley 
et al. 2016; Santos et al. 2017). This is particularly important for 
marine turtles as changing temperatures will affect the hatchling 
sex ratio because sex is determined by nest site temperature (high 
conﬁdence) (Hatﬁeld et  al. 2012; Santidrián Tomillo et  al. 2014; 
Patricio et al. 2017). Loss of breeding substrate, including mostly 
coastal habitats such as sandy beaches (Section 5.3.3), can reduce 
the available nesting or pupping habitat for land breeding marine 
turtles, lizards, seabirds and pinnipeds (Fish et  al. 2005; Fuentes 
et al. 2010; Funayama et al. 2013; Reece et al. 2013; Katselidis et al. 
2014; Patino-Martinez et al. 2014; Pike et al. 2015; Reynolds et al.

2015; Marshall et  al. 2017) (high conﬁdence). Climatic hazards 
such as SLR contributes to the loss of these coastal habitats (see 
Section 5.3 and Chapter  3). Changes in ocean temperature will 
also indirectly impact marine mammals, seabirds and reptiles by 
changing the abundance and distribution of their prey (Polovina, 
2005; Polovina et  al. 2011; Doney et  al. 2012; Sydeman et  al. 
2015; Briscoe et al. 2017; Woodworth-Jefcoats et al. 2017) (high 
conﬁdence). The distributions of some of these large animals is 
determined by the occurrence and persistence of oceanic bridges 
and barriers that are related to climate driven processes (Ascani 
et al. 2016; McKeon et al. 2016). For example, the decline of Arctic 
sea ice is affecting the range and migration patterns of some species 
and is allowing the exchange of species previously restricted to 
either the Paciﬁc or Atlantic oceans (Alter et  al. 2015; George 
et al. 2015; Laidre et al. 2015; MacIntyre et al. 2015; McKeon et al. 
2016; Breed et al. 2017; Hauser et al. 2017) (Chapter 3). Also, the 
range expansion of some of these predatory megafauna can affect 
species endemic to the habitat; for example, while the decrease 
in summer sea ice in the Arctic may favour the expansion of killer 
whales (Orcinus orca), their occurrence can result in narwhale 
(Monodon monoceros) to avoid the use of key habitats to reduce 
the risk of killer whales’ predation (Bost et  al. 2009; Sydeman 
et al. 2015; Breed et al. 2017) (see Chapter 3; section 3.2.1.4). In 
addition, marine mammals, seabirds and sea turtles present habitat 
requirements associated with bathymetric and mesoscale features 
that facilitate the aggregation of their prey (Bost et  al. 2015; 
Kavanaugh et al. 2015; Hindell et al. 2016; Hunt et al. 2016; Santora 
et  al. 2017). The persistence and location of these features are 
linked to variations in climate (Crocker et al. 2006; Baez et al. 2011; 
Dugger et al. 2014; Abrahms et al. 2017; Youngﬂesh et al. 2017) 
and to foraging success, juvenile recruitment, breeding phenology, 
growth rates and population stability (Costa et al. 2010; Ancona 
and Drummond, 2013; Ducklow et al. 2013; Chambers et al. 2014; 
Descamps et al. 2015; Abadi et al. 2017; Bjorndal et al. 2017; Fluhr

et al. 2017; Youngﬂesh et al. 2017) (high conﬁdence). Overall, recent 
evidence further support that impacts of climate change on some 
marine reptiles, mammals and birds have been observed in recent 
decades (high conﬁdence) and that the direction of impacts vary 
between species, population and geographic locations (Trivelpiece 
et al. 2011; Hazen et al. 2013; Clucas et al. 2014; Constable et al. 
2014; George et al. 2015) (high conﬁdence). 
Warming has contributed also to observed changes in phenology 
(timing of repeated seasonal activities) of marine organisms 
(Gittings et al. 2018), although observations are biased towards the 
northeast Atlantic (Poloczanska et al. 2016; Thackeray et al. 2016). 
Shifts in the timing of interacting species have occurred in the 
last decades, eventually leading to uncoupling between prey and 
predators, with cascading community and ecosystem consequences 
(Kharouba et  al. 2018; Neuheimer et  al. 2018). Timing of spring 
phenology of marine organisms is shifting to earlier in the year 
under warming, at an average rate of 4.4 ± 1.1 days per decade 
(Poloczanska et al. 2013), although it is variable among taxonomic 
groups and among ocean regions (Lindley and Kirby, 2010). This is 
consistent with the expectations based on the close relationship 
between temperature and these biological events, supporting 
evidence from AR5 (Bruge et al. 2016; Poloczanska et al. 2016). Thus, 
the growing amount of literature and new studies since AR5 WGII 
and SR15 further support  that phenology of marine ectotherms 
in the epipelagic systems are related to ocean warming (high 
conﬁdence) and that the timing of biological events has shifted 
earlier (high conﬁdence). 
Observed impacts of multiple climatic hazards
WGII AR5 concludes that multiple climatic hazards from ocean 
acidiﬁcation, hypoxia and decrease in nutrient and food supplies 
pose risks to marine ecosystems, and the risk can be elevated when 
combined with warming (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2014; Gattuso et al. 
2015). In a recent meta-analysis of 632 published experiments, 
primary production by temperate non-calcifying plankton increases 
with elevated temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton 
decreases productivity because of acidiﬁcation (Nagelkerken and 
Connell, 2015). Also, temperature increases consumption and 
metabolic rates of herbivores but not secondary production; the 
latter decreases with acidiﬁcation in calcifying and non-calcifying 
species. These effects together create a mismatch with carnivores 
whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with temperature 
(Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015). Warming may also exacerbate 
the effects of ocean acidiﬁcation on the rate of photosynthesis in 
phytoplankton (Lefevre, 2016). There is some, but limited, reports of 
observed impacts on calciﬁed pelagic organisms that are attributed 
to secular trend in ocean acidiﬁcation and warming (Harvey et al. 
2013; Kroeker et al. 2013; Nagelkerken et al. 2015; Boyd et al. 2016). 
For example, Rivero-Calle et al. (2015) reported, using CPR archives, 
that stocks of coccolithophores (a group of phytoplankton that forms 
calcium carbonate plateles) have increased by 2% to over 20% in 
the north Atlantic over the last ﬁve decades, and that this increase 
is linked to synergistic effects of increasing anthropogenic CO2 and 
rising temperatures, as supported by their statistical analysis and 
a number of experimental studies. Most of the available evidence 
supports that ocean acidiﬁcation and hypoxia can act additively or 
synergistically between each other and with temperature across 
different groups of biota (Figure 5.13). Limitation of nutrient and 
food availability and predation pressures can further increase 
the sensitivity of organismal groups to climate change in speciﬁc 
ecosystems (Riebesell et  al. 2017). Climate change also affects 
organisms indirectly through the impacts on competitiveness 
between organisms that favour those that are more adaptive to 
the changing environmental conditions (Alguero-Muniz et al. 2017) 
and changes in trophic interactions (Seebacher et al. 2014). Overall, 
direct in situ observations and laboratory experiments show that 
there are signiﬁcant responses to the multiple stressors of warming, 
ocean acidiﬁcation and low oxygen on phytoplankton, zooplankton 
and ﬁshes and that these responses can be additive or synergistic 
(high conﬁdence, Figure 5.13). 
5.2.3.1.2 Future changes in the epipelagic ocean
WGII AR5 and SR15 conclude that projected ocean warming will 
continue to cause poleward shifts in the distribution and biomass 
of pelagic species, paralleled by altered seasonal timing of their 
activities, species abundance, migration pattern and reduction 
in body size in the 21st century under scenarios of increasing 
greenhouse gas emission (Pörtner et  al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg 
et al. 2018). Simultaneously, projected expansion of OMZ and ocean 
acidiﬁcation could lead to shifts in community composition toward 
hypoxia-tolerant and non-calciﬁed organisms, respectively. However, 
these projected biological changes in the ocean raise questions 
about how individuals, communities and food webs will respond to 
the multiple impacts from climatic and non-climatic stressors in the 
future, and the feedbacks of the effects of their ecological impacts 
on modifying the physical and biogeochemical conditions of the 
ocean (Schaum et al. 2013; Boyd et al. 2016; O’Brien et al. 2016; 
Moore, 2018). This section focuses on addressing these questions in 
order to assess the future risk of impacts of climate change on the 
epipelagic ecosystem.
Future projections on phytoplankton distribution,  
community structure and biomass
While analysis of outputs from CMIP5 ESMs project that global 
average NPP and biomass of phytoplankton community will decrease 
in the 21st century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (see Section 5.2.2.6). 
However, the future risk of impacts of epipelagic ecosystem can 
also depend on changes in community structure of phytoplankton 
species. Barton et al. (2016) projected the biogeography of 87 taxa 
of phytoplankton (diatoms and dinoﬂagellates) in the north Atlantic 
to 2051–2100 relative to the past (1951–2000) with scenarios of 
changes in temperature and other ocean conditions such as salinity, 
density and nutrients under RCP8.5. The study found that 74% of the 
studied taxa exhibit a poleward shift at a median rate of 12.9 km 
per decade, but 90% of the taxa shift eastward at a median rate 
of 42.7 km per decade. Such changes may affect food webs and 
biogeochemical cycles, and with consequence to the productivity of 
living marine resources (Stock et al. 2014; Barton et al. 2016).

Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

Outputs from CMIP5 ESMs suggest that projected warming and 
reduction in nutrient availability in low latitudes, as a result of 
increasing stratiﬁcation of the ocean under climate change, will 
increase the dominance of small-sized phytoplankton, growing 
more efﬁciently than larger taxa at low nutrient levels (Dutkiewicz 
et  al. 2013b). Dominant groups in subtropical oceans, like the 
picoplanktonic cyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, 
are projected to expand their range of distribution towards higher 
latitudes and increase their abundances by 14–29%, respectively, 
under a future warmer ocean (Flombaum et  al. 2013), although 
synergistic effects of warming and CO2 on photosynthetic rates 
could lead to a dominance of Synechococcus over Prochlorococcus 
(Fu et al. 2007) (low conﬁdence). Similarly, temperature-driven range 
shifts towards higher latitudes are also likely for tropical diazotrophic 
(N2-ﬁxing) cyanobacteria, although they could disappear from parts 
of their current tropical ranges where future warming may exceed 
their maximum thermal tolerance limits (Hutchins and Fu, 2017) 
(low conﬁdence). Modelling experiments show that the effects of 
warming on phytoplankton community will be exacerbated by ocean 
acidiﬁcation at levels expected in the 21st century for RCP8.5, leading 
to increasing growth rate responses of some phytoplankton groups, 
such as diazotrophs and Synechococcus, with predicted increases in 
biomass up to 10% in tropical and subtropical waters (Dutkiewicz 
et al. 2015) (low conﬁdence). Furthermore, warming is projected to 
interact with decreasing oxygen levels and increases in iron in the 
nutrient-impoverished subtropical waters, favoring the dominance of 
the diazotrophic colonial cyanobacteria Trichodesmium (Sohm et al. 
2011; Boyd et al. 2013; Ward et al. 2013; Hutchins and Fu, 2017) 
(medium conﬁdence).
Regional differences in the changes in phytoplankton community 
and their impacts on epipelagic ecosystem are however complex 
and depends on multiple interactions of co-varying climate change 
stressors at regional level (Boyd and Hutchins, 2012). Based on 
global ocean model simulations, Boyd et  al. (2015b) show that 
the interaction between warming, increased CO2 and a decline in 
phosphate and silicate would beneﬁt coccolithophores against 
diatoms in the northern north Atlantic, despite decreasing rates 
of calciﬁcation. Evidence, based on long-term experiments of 
acclimation or adaptation to increasing temperatures in combination 
with elevated CO2, show that individual growth and carbon ﬁxation 
rates of coccolithophores at high CO2 are modulated by temperature, 
light, nutrients and UV radiation, and could increase calciﬁcation 
while the responses are also species-speciﬁc (Lohbeck et al. 2012; 
Khanna et al. 2013). Calciﬁcation of planktonic foraminifera will be 
however negatively affected by acidiﬁcation (Roy et al. 2015), and 
their populations are predicted to experience the greatest decrease 
in diversity and abundance in sub-polar and tropical areas, under 
RCP8.5 (Brussaard et al. 2013), however environmental controls of 
calcite production by foraminifera are still poorly understood (low 
conﬁdence). Boyd et al. (2015b) analysis indicate also that diatoms 
would beneﬁt from the synergistic effects of increased warming 
and iron supply in the northern Southern Ocean, as supported by 
laboratory experiments and ﬁeld studies with polar diatoms (Rose 
et  al. 2009) (low conﬁdence). At low-latitude provinces, projected 
concurrent increases of CO2 and iron, and decreases in both nitrate 
and phosphate supply, may favour nitrogen ﬁxers, but with ocean 
regional variability, since iron is thought to limit N2 ﬁxation in 
the eastern Paciﬁc and phosphorus in the Atlantic Ocean (Gruber, 
2019; Wang et  al. 2019). However, recent experimental work 
with the diazotrophic colonial Trichodesmium and the unicellular 
Crocosphaera have shown a broad range of responses from rising 
CO2, with either increases or decreases in N2 ﬁxation rates, and with 
mixed evidence on co-limiting processes (Eichner et al. 2014; Garcia 
et al. 2014; Gradoville et al. 2014; Walworth et al. 2016; Hong et al. 
2017; Luo et al. 2019) (low conﬁdence).
Overall, the response of phytoplankton to the interactive effects of 
multiple drivers is complex, and presently ESMs do not resolve the 
full complexity of their physiological responses (Breitberg et al. 2015; 
Hutchins and Boyd, 2016; O’Brien et al. 2016), precluding a clear 
assessment of the effects of these regional distinctive multi-stressor 
patterns (high conﬁdence).
Future projections on zooplankton distribution and biomass
An ensemble of 12 CMIP5 ESMs project average declines of 
6.4  ±  0.79% (95% conﬁdent limits) and 13.6 ± 1.70%) in 
zooplankton biomass in the 21st century relative to 1990–1999 
historical values under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (Kwiatkowski et  al. 
2019). Also, production of mesozooplankton is projected from 
a single ESM to decrease by 7.9% between 1951–2000 and 2051–
2100 under RCP8.5 (Stock et al. 2014). Such projected decreases 
in zooplankton biomass and production are partly contributed 
by climate-induced reduction in phytoplankton production and 
trophic transfer efﬁciency particularly in low-latitude ecosystems 
(Stock et al. 2014) (5.2.2.6). The impacts may be larger than these 
projections if changes in the relative abundance of carbon, nitrogen 
and phosphorus are considered by the models (Kwiatkowski et al. 
2019). The overall projected decrease in zooplankton biomass is 
characterised by a strong latitudinal differences, with the largest 
decrease in tropical regions and increase in the polar regions, 
particularly the Arctic Ocean (Chust et al. 2014; Stock et al. 2014; 
Kwiatkowski et al. 2019) (Chapter 3) (high agreement). However, 
the projected increase in zooplankton biomass in the polar 
region may be affected by the seasonality of light cycle at high 
latitudes that may limit the bloom season at high latitude (Sundby 
et  al. 2016). The projected decrease in zooplankton abundance, 
particularly in tropical regions, can impact marine organisms higher 
in the foodweb, including ﬁsh populations that are important to 
ﬁsheries (Woodworth-Jefcoats et al. 2017). Therefore, there is high 
agreement in model projections that global zooplankton biomass 
will very likely reduce in the 21st century, with projected decline 
under RCP8.5 almost doubled that of RCP2.6 (very likely). However, 
the strong dependence of the projected declines on phytoplankton 
production (low conﬁdence, 5.2.2.6) and simpliﬁcation in 
representation of the zooplankton communities and foodweb 
render their projections having low conﬁdence.
Future responses of zooplankton species and communities to climate 
change are however affected by interactions between multiple 
climatic drivers. Experiments in laboratory show that acidiﬁcation 
could partly counteract some observed effects of increased 
temperature on zooplankton, although the level and direction of the 
biological responses vary largely between species (Mayor et al. 2015; 
483
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5

Garzke et al. 2016), with results ranging from no effects (Weydmann 
et al. 2012; McConville et al. 2013; Cripps et al. 2014; Alguero-Muniz 
et al. 2016; Bailey et al. 2016), to negative effects (Lischka et al. 2011; 
Cripps et  al. 2014; Alguero-Muniz et  al. 2017) or positive effects 
(Alguero-Muniz et al. 2017; Taucher et al. 2017). These differences 
in response can affect trophic interactions between zooplankton 
species; for example, some predatory non-calcifying zooplankton 
may perform better under warmer and lower pH conditions, leading 
to increased predation on other zooplankton species (Caron and 
Hutchins, 2012; Winder et al. 2017). Therefore, the large variation in 
sensitivity between zooplankton to future conditions of warming and 
ocean acidiﬁcation suggests elevated risk on community structure and 
inter-speciﬁc interactions of zooplankton in the 21st century (medium 
conﬁdence). Consideration of these species-speciﬁc responses may 
further modify the projected changes in zooplankton biomass by 
ESMs (Boyd et al. 2015a).
Future projections on ﬁsh distribution, size and biomass
Recent model projections since AR5 and SR15 continue to support 
global-scale range shifts of marine ﬁshes at rates of tens to 
hundreds of km per decade in the 21st century, with rate of shifts 
being substantially higher under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6 (Jones and 
Cheung, 2015; Robinson et al. 2015; Morley et al. 2018). Globally, 
the general direction of range shifts of epipelagic ﬁshes is poleward 
(Jones and Cheung, 2015; Robinson et al. 2015), while the projected 
directions of regional and local range shifts generally follow 
temperature gradients (Morley et al. 2018). Polewards range shifts 
are projected to result in decreases in species richness in tropical 
oceans, and increases in mid to high-latitude regions leading to 
global-scale species turnover (sum of species local extinction and 
expansion) (Ben Rais Lasram et al. 2010; Jones and Cheung, 2015; 
Cheung and Pauly, 2016; Molinos et al. 2016) (medium conﬁdence 
on trends, low conﬁdence on magnitude because of model 
uncertainties and limited number of published model simulations). 
For example, species turnover relative to their present day richness 
in the tropical oceans (30ºN–30ºS) is projected to be 14–21% and 
37–39% by 2031–2050 and 2081–2100 under RCP8.5 (ranges 
of mean projections from two sets of simulation for marine ﬁsh 
distributions) (Jones and Cheung, 2015; Molinos et  al. 2016). In 
contrast, high-latitude regions (>60ºN–60ºS) is projected to have 
higher rate of species turnover than the tropics (an average of 48% 
between the two data sets for region >60ºN). The high species 
turnover in the Arctic is explained by species’ range expansion from 
lower-latitude and the relatively lower present day ﬁsh species 
richness in the Arctic. The projected intensity of species turnover 
is lower under lower emission scenarios (Jones and Cheung, 2015; 
Molinos et  al. 2016) (see also Section  5.4.1) (high conﬁdence). 
Projections from multiple ﬁsh species distribution models show 
hotspots of decrease in species richness in the Indo-Paciﬁc region, 
and semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and Persian Gulf 
(Cheung et al. 2013; Burrows et al. 2014; García Molinos et al. 2015; 
Jones and Cheung, 2015; Wabnitz et al. 2018) (medium evidence, 
high agreement). In addition, geographic barriers such as land 
boundaries in the poleward species range edge in semi-enclosed 
seas or lower oxygen water in deeper waters are projected to limit 
range shifts, resulting in larger relative decrease in species richness 
(medium conﬁdence) (Cheung et  al. 2013; Burrows et  al. 2014; 
García  Molinos et  al. 2015; Jones and Cheung, 2015; Rutterford 
et al. 2015).
Warming and decrease in oxygen content is projected to impact 
growth of ﬁshes, leading to reduction in body size and contraction 
of suitable environmental conditions (Deutsch et al. 2015; Pauly and 
Cheung, 2017), with the intensity of impacts being directly related 
to the level of climate change. The projected reduction in abundance 
of larger-bodied ﬁshes could reduce predation and exacerbate the 
increase in dominance of smaller-bodied ﬁshes in the epipelagic 
ecosystem (Lefort et al. 2015). Fishes exposed to ocean acidiﬁcation 
level expected under RCP8.5 showed impairments of sensory ability 
and alteration of behaviour including olfaction, hearing, vision, 
homing and predator avoidance (Kroeker et  al. 2013; Heuer and 
Grosell, 2014; Nagelkerken et  al. 2015). The combined effects of 
warming, ocean deoxygenation and acidiﬁcation in the 21st century 
are projected to exacerbate the impacts on the body size, growth, 
reproduction and mortality of ﬁshes, and consequently increases 
their risk of population decline (medium evidence, high agreement, 
high conﬁdence).
An ensemble of global-scale marine ecosystem and ﬁsheries 
models that are part of the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystems 
Impact Models Intercomparison Project (FISHMIP) undertook 
coordinated simulation experiments and projected future changes 
in marine animals (mainly  invertebrate and ﬁsh)  globally under 
climate change (Lotze et al. 2018). These models represent marine 
biota and ecosystems differently, ranging from population-based 
to functional traits- and size-based structure and their responses 
are driven primarily by temperature and NPP, although oxygen, 
salinity and ocean advection are considered in a subset of models

and play a secondary role in affecting the projected changes in 
biomass (Blanchard et al. 2012; Fernandes et al. 2013; Carozza et al. 
2016; Cheung et al. 2016a). Overall, potential total marine animal 
biomass is projected to decrease by 4.3 ± 2.0% (95% conﬁdent 
intervals) and 15.0 ± 5.9% under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively, 
by 2080–2099 relative to 1986–2005, while the decrease is around 
4.9% by 2031–2050 across all RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (very likely) 
(Figure 5.14). Accounting for the  removal of biomass by ﬁshing 
exacerbates the decrease in biomass  for large-bodied animals 
which are particularly sensitive to ﬁshing (likely for the direction 
of changes). Regionally, total animal biomass decreases largely in 
tropical and mid-latitude oceans (very likely) (Table 5.3, Figure 5.14) 
(Bryndum-Buchholz et al. 2019). The high uncertainty and the low 
conﬁdence in the projection in the Arctic Ocean (Chapter 3) is 
because of the large variations in simulation results for this region 
between the ESMs and between the FISHMIP models, as well as 
the insufﬁcient understanding of the oceanographic changes and 
their biological implications in the Arctic Ocean. In the Southern 
Ocean, the decrease in consumer biomass is mainly in the southern 
Indian Ocean while other parts of the Southern Ocean are projected 
to have an increase in animal biomass by 2100 under RCP8.5, 
reﬂecting mainly the projected pattern of changes in NPP from the 
ESMs (see Section 5.2.2.6).
Future projections on epipelagic components  
of the biological pump
A wide range of studies, from laboratory experiments, mesocosm 
enclosures, synthesis of observations to modeling experiments, 
provide insights into how the multi-faceted components of the 
‘biological pump’ (the physical and biologically mediated processes 
responsible for transporting organic carbon from the upper ocean 
to depth) are projected to be altered in the coming decades. 
A synthesis of the individual components reported to both inﬂuence 
the performance of the biological pump, and which are sensitive 
to changing ocean conditions, is presented in Table 5.4. The table 
lists the putative controlling of each environmental factor, such as 
warming, that inﬂuences the biological pump, and the reported 
modiﬁcation (where available) of each individual factor by changing 
ocean conditions for both the epipelagic ocean and the deep 
ocean. Analyses of long-term trends in primary production and 
particle export production, as well as model simulations, reveal that 
increasing temperatures, leading to enhanced stratiﬁcation and 
nutrient limitation, will have the greatest inﬂuence on decreasing the 
ﬂux of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the deep ocean (Bopp 
et al. 2013; Boyd et al. 2015a; Fu et al. 2016; Laufkötter et al. 2016). 
However, different lines of evidence (including observation, modeling 
and experimental studies) provide low conﬁdence on the mechanistic 
understanding of how climatic drivers affect different components of 
the biological pump in the epipelagic ocean, as well as changes in 
the efﬁciency and magnitude of carbon export in the deep ocean (see 
section below and Table 5.4); this renders the projection of future 
contribution of the biological carbon pump to the export of POC to 
the deep ocean having low conﬁdence.

5.2.3.2 
The Deep Pelagic Ocean
5.2.3.2.1 Detection and attribution of biological  
changes in the deep ocean
The pelagic realm of the deep ocean represents a key site for 
remineralisation of organic matter and long-term biological carbon 
storage and burial in the biosphere (Arístegui et  al. 2009), but 
the observed effects of climate change on deep sea organisms, 
communities and biological processes are largely unknown (high 
conﬁdence). Observational and model-based methods provide 
limited evidence that the transfer efﬁciency of organic carbon to 
the sea ﬂoor is partly controlled by temperature and oxygen in the 
mesopelagic zone, affecting microbial metabolism and zooplankton 
community structure, with highest efﬁciencies for high-latitude and 
OMZ) (see Section 5.2.2.4 for more detail on OMZs), while below 
1000 m organic carbon transfer is controlled by particle sinking 
speed (Boyd et al. 2015a; Marsay et al. 2015; DeVries and Weber, 
2017). However, there are contrasting results and low conﬁdence 
on whether transfer efﬁciencies are highest at low or high latitudes 
(Boyd et al. 2015a; Marsay et al. 2015; Guidi et al. 2016; DeVries and 
Weber, 2017; Sweetman et al. 2017). There is also low conﬁdence on

the effects of increasing temperatures on POC remineralisation to 
CO2 versus POC solubilisation to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 
microbial communities and its storage as refractory DOC (i.e., with 
life times of >16,000 years) (Legendre et al. 2015).
5.2.3.2.2 Future changes in the deep ocean
The global magnitude of the biological pump and how this will be 
affected by climate change is also uncertain. Model-based studies 
agree in projecting a global decline in particle gravitational ﬂux 
to the deep sea ﬂoor, but with regional variability in both the 
total particle export ﬂux and transfer efﬁciency (DeVries and 
Weber, 2017; Sweetman et  al. 2017) (see Sections 5.2.2 and 
5.2.4). However, recent evidence suggest that other physical 
and biological processes may contribute nearly as much as the 
gravitational ﬂux to the carbon transport from the surface to the 
deep ocean (Boyd et al. 2019), with low conﬁdence on the future 
rate of change in magnitude and direction of these processes. 
In particular, the ‘active ﬂux’ of organic carbon due to vertical 
migration of zooplankton and ﬁshes has been reported to account 
from 10 to 40% of the gravitational sinking ﬂux (Bianchi et  al. 
2013; Davison et al. 2013; Hudson et al. 2014; Jónasdóttir et al. 
2015; Aumont et al. 2018; Gorgues et al. 2019). Predictions based 
on model studies suggest that mesopelagic zooplankton and ﬁsh 
communities living at deep scattering layers (DSLs) will increase 
their biomass by 2100, enhancing their trophic efﬁciency, because 
of deep-ocean warming (Section 5.2.2.1; Figures 5.2 and 5.3) and 
shallowing of DSL (Proud et al. 2017) (low conﬁdence). Expansion 
of OMZs (see Section 5.2.2.4) will also widen the DSL and increase 
the exposure of mesopelagic organisms to shallower depths (Gilly 
et al. 2013; Netburn and Anthony Koslow, 2015). In the California 
Current, the abundance of mesopelagic ﬁshes is closely tied to 
variations in the OMZ, whose dynamic is linked to the Paciﬁc 
Decadal Oscillation and ENSO cycles (Koslow et al. 2015). Some 
large predators, like the Humboldt squid, could indirectly beneﬁt 
from expanding OMZs due to the aggregation of their primary 
food source, myctophid ﬁshes (Stewart et al. 2014). However, many 
non-adapted ﬁsh and invertebrates (like diurnal vertical migrators) 
will have their depth distributions compressed, affecting the carbon 
transport and trophic efﬁciency of food webs in the mesopelagic 
(Stramma et  al. 2011; Brown and Thatje, 2014; Rogers, 2015) 
(low conﬁdence). In OMZ waters, where zooplankton is almost 
absent, like in the Eastern Tropical North Paciﬁc, the microbial 
remineralisation efﬁciency of sinking particles would be reduced, 
eventually increasing the transfer efﬁciency of organic matter to 
the deep ocean and thus biological carbon storage (Cavan et al. 
2017) (low conﬁdence; Table 1). However, increases in ocean 
temperature may also lead to shallower remineralisation of POC 
in warm tropical regions, counteracting the storage of carbon in 
the dark ocean (Marsay et al. 2015). Overall, the direct impacts of 
climate change on the biological pump are not well understood for 
the deep pelagic organisms and ecosystems (Pörtner et al. 2014), 
and there is low conﬁdence on the effect of climate change drivers 
on biological processes in the deep ocean (Table 5.1).
5.2.4 
Impacts on Deep Seaﬂoor Systems
5.2.4.1 
Changes on the Deep Seaﬂoor
The deep seaﬂoor is assessed here as the vast area of the ocean bottom 
>200 m deep, beyond most continental shelves (Levin and Sibuet, 2012; 
Boyd et al. 2019) (Figure 5.15). Below 200 m changes in light, food 
supply and the physical environment lead to altered benthic (seaﬂoor) 
animal taxonomic composition, morphologies, lifestyles and body sizes 
collectively understood to represent the deep sea (Tyler, 2003).
Most deep seaﬂoor ecosystems globally are experiencing rising 
temperatures, declining oxygen levels, and elevated CO2, leading 
to lower pH and carbonate undersaturation (WGII AR5 30.5.7; 
Section 5.2.2.3). Small changes in exposure to these hazards by deep 
seaﬂoor ecosystem have been conﬁrmed by observation over the 
past 50 years. However, analysis using direct seaﬂoor observations 
of these hazards over the past 15–29 years suggest that the 
environmental conditions are highly variable over time because of 
the strong and variable inﬂuences by ocean conditions from the 
sea surface (Frigstad et al. 2015; Thomsen et al. 2017). Such high 
environmental variability makes it difﬁcult to attribute observed 
trends to anthropogenic drivers using existing datasets (Smith et al. 
2013; Hartman et  al. 2015; Soltwedel et  al. 2016; Thomsen et  al. 
2017) (high conﬁdence). Projections from global ESMs suggest large 
changes for temperature by 2100 and beyond under RCP8.5 (relative 
to present day variation) (Mora et al. 2013; Sweetman et al. 2017; 
FAO, 2019). The magnitude of the projected changes is lower under 
RCP2.6, and in some cases the direction of projected change to 2100 
varies regionally under either scenario (FAO, 2019) (high conﬁdence).
5.2.4.2 
Open Ocean Seaﬂoor – Abyssal Plains (3000–6000 m)
Abyssal communities (3000–6000 m) cover over 50% of the ocean’s 
surface and are considered to be extremely food limited (Gage and 
Tyler, 1992; Smith et al. 2018). There is a strong positive relationship 
between surface primary production, export ﬂux, and organic matter 
supply to the abyssal seaﬂoor (Smith et  al. 2008), with pulses of 
surface production reﬂected as carbon input on the deep seaﬂoor in 
days to months (Thomsen et al. 2017). Both vertical and horizontal 
transport contribute organic matter to the sea ﬂoor (Frischknecht 
et al. 2018). Food supply to the seaﬂoor regulates faunal biomass, 
explaining the strong positive relationships documented between 
surface production and seaﬂoor faunal biomass in the Paciﬁc Ocean 
(Smith et al. 2013), Gulf of Mexico (Wei et al. 2011) and north Atlantic 
Ocean (Hartman et al. 2015). Extended time series and broad spatial 
coverage reveal strong positive relationship between annual POC 
ﬂux and abyssal sediment community oxygen consumption (Rowe 
et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2016a). Observed reduction in in POC ﬂux 
at the abyssal seaﬂoor enhances the relative importance of the 
microbial loop and reduces the importance of benthic invertebrates in 
carbon transfer (Dunlop et al. 2016) (single study, limited evidence). 
However, changes in the overlying mesopelagic and bathypelagic 
communities (see Section 5.2.3.2) will also affect food ﬂux to the 
deep seaﬂoor, as nekton and zooplankton transfer energy to depth 
through diel (daily day-night) vertical migrations, ontogenetic (life 
staged-based) migrations and falls of dead carcasses (Gage, 2003).

Therefore, climate change impacts on organic carbon export 
from the epipelagic (Section 5.2.3.1) and deeper pelagic systems 
(Section  5.2.3.2) can affect the energy available to support the 
abyssal seaﬂoor ecosystems (medium conﬁdence). However, because 
observations on historical changes in POC ﬂux in abyssal seaﬂoor 
ecosystems are limited to a few locations, long-term records show 
high variability, and mechanistic understanding of factors affecting 
the biological carbon pump is incomplete, there is limited evidence 
that the abyssal seaﬂoor ecosystem has already been affected by 
changes in POC ﬂux as a result of climate change. The metabolic 
rate of deep seaﬂoor ectotherms, and consequently their demand for 
food, increases with temperature. Thus, observed warming in deep 
sea ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 2014) (Section 5.2.2.2.1) 
is expected to increase the sensitivity of deep seaﬂoor biota to 
decrease in food supplies associated with a change in POC ﬂux 
(high conﬁdence). However, there is limited evidence of observed 
changes in abyssal biota. Small deep sea biota demonstrate 
increased efﬁciency (effective use of food energy for growth and 
metabolism with minimal loss) at low food inputs (due to small size 
and dominance by prokaryotic taxa) (Gambi et al. 2017). Adaptation 
to low food availability in abyssal ecosystems may confer higher 
capacity to adjust to reduced food availability than for shallow biota 
(limited evidence). Overall, the risk of impacts of climate change on 
abyssal ecosystems through reduction in food supplies from declining 
POC ﬂux in the present day is low with low conﬁdence.
The globally integrated export ﬂux of carbon is projected to decrease 
in the open ocean in the 21st century under RCP2.6 (by 1.6–4.9%) 
and RCP8.5 (by 8.9–15.8%) relative to 2000 (medium conﬁdence) 
(Section 5.2.2.6). This change in export ﬂux of carbon is projected 
to yield declines in POC ﬂux at the abyssal seaﬂoor (representing 
food supply to benthos) of up to –27% in the Atlantic and up to 
–31 to –40% in the Paciﬁc and Indian Oceans, with some increases 
in polar regions (Sweetman et al. 2017). In some models, additional 
dissolution of calcium carbonate due to ocean acidiﬁcation further 
lowers POC ﬂux, causing the projected export production declines to 
be up to 38% at the northeast Atlantic seaﬂoor (Jones et al. 2014). 
Lower POC ﬂuxes to the abyss reduce food supply and have been 
projected to cause a size-shift towards smaller organisms (Jones et al. 
2014), resulting in rising respiration rates, lower biomass production 
efﬁciency, and lesser energy transfer to higher trophic levels (Brown 
et  al. 2004) (medium conﬁdence). Changes are projected to be 
largest for macrofauna and lesser and similar for megafauna and 
meiofauna (Jones et  al. 2014) (limited evidence, low conﬁdence).

Projections using outputs from seven CMIP5 models suggest that 
97.8 ± 0.6% (95% CI) of the abyssal seaﬂoor area will experience 
a  biomass decline by 2091–2100 relative to 2006–2015 under 
RCP8.5. The projected decreases in overall POC ﬂux to the abyssal 
seaﬂoor are projected to cause a 5.2–17.6% reduction in seaﬂoor 
biomass in 2090–2100, relative to 2006–2015 under RCP8.5 (Jones 
et al. 2014). The projected impacts on abyssal seaﬂoor biomass are 
signiﬁcantly larger under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5 (Jones et al. 2014). 
However, existing estimates are based on total POC ﬂux changes 
and do not account for changes in the type or quality of the sinking 
material, to which macrofaunal and meiofaunal invertebrates are 
highly sensitive (Smith et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2009; Tittensor et al. 
2011). The projections also do not account for direct faunal responses 
to changes in temperature, oxygen or the carbonate system, all of 
which will inﬂuence benthic responses to changing food availability 
(AR5 Chapter 30.5.7), reducing to medium conﬁdence the risk 
assessment that is based on these projections (Figure 5.16).
Regionally, while reductions in POC ﬂux are projected at low and 
mid latitudes in the Paciﬁc, Indian and Atlantic Oceans, increases are 
projected at high latitudes associated in part with reduction in sea ice 
cover (Yool et al. 2013; Rogers, 2015; Sweetman et al. 2017; Yool et al. 
2017; FAO 2019) (see Chapter 3) (medium conﬁdence). Notably, Arctic 
and Southern Ocean POC ﬂuxes at the abyssal seaﬂoor are projected 
to increase by up to 38% and 21%, respectively by 2100 under 
RCP8.5 (Sweetman et al. 2017). While an increase in food supply may 
yield higher benthic biomass at high latitudes, warmer temperatures 
and reduced pH projected for the polar regions (Chapter 3) would 
elevate faunal metabolic demands, likely diminishing the beneﬁt of 
elevated food supply to an unknown extent (Sweetman et al. 2017). 
Overall, given the limited food availability for fauna in the abyssal 
plains and the projected warming (Section 5.2.2.2.2) that increases 
the demand for food to support the elevated metabolic rates, the 
projected decrease in inﬂux of organic matter and seaﬂoor biomass 
will result in high risks of impacts to abyssal ecosystems by the end 
of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence) (Figure 5.16). 
The risk of impacts is projected to be substantially lower under 
RCP4.5 or RCP2.6 (high conﬁdence). The impacts on abyssal seaﬂoor 
ecosystems affect functions that are important to support ecosystem 
services (see Section 5.4.1). For example, smaller-sized organisms 
exhibit reduced bioturbation intensity and depth of mixing causing 
reduced carbon sequestration (Smith et al. 2008) (Figure 5.15).
5.2.4.3 
Bathyal Ecosystems (200–3000 m)
Bathyal ecosystems consist of numerous geomorphic features with 
steep topography (Figure 5.15). These include continental slopes 
covering 5.2% of the seaﬂoor, over 9400 steep-sided canyons, and 
>9000 conical seamounts (submarine volcanos which are mainly 
inactive), as well as guyots and ridges which together cover ~6% 
of the seaﬂoor (Harris et al. 2014). Seamounts and canyons support 
high animal densities and biomass including cold water coral, sponge 
and bryozoan reefs, exhibit high secondary production supported by 
locally enhanced primary production and intensiﬁed water ﬂow, 
function as diversity hotspots and serve as stepping stones for larval 
dispersal (Rowden et al. 2010). Canyons transport particulate organic 
matter, migrating plankton and coarse material from the shelf, and 
are sites where intensiﬁed mixing and advection of water masses 
occurs (De Leo et al. 2010; Levin and Sibuet, 2012; Fernandez-Arcaya 
et al. 2017). Slopes, canyons and seamounts exhibit strong vertical 
temperature, oxygen and pH gradients generating sharp ecological 
zonation (Levin and Sibuet, 2012), thus changes in exposures are 
expected to alter the distributions of their communities (Figure 5.15, 
5.16) (medium conﬁdence).
In some regions, observational records document changing 
conditions in bathyal ecosystems (Levin, 2018; Section 5.2.2.4). In the 
Northeast Paciﬁc continental slopes associated with the California 
Current ecosystem, observations over the past 25 years show high 
variability but an overall trend of decreasing ocean oxygen and 
pH levels with oxygen declines of up to 40% and pH declines of 
0.08  units in California. (Goericke et  al. 2015) (high agreement, 
robust evidence, high conﬁdence). Large oxygen declines are linked 
to past warming events on continental margins, over multiple time 
scales from 1–100 ky (Dickson et al. 2012; Mofﬁtt et al. 2015). Studies 
across modern oxygen gradients on slopes reveal that suboxic 
(5–10 μMol kg–1 O2) values lead to loss of biodiversity of ﬁsh (Gallo 
and Levin, 2016), invertebrates (Levin, 2003; Gallo and Levin, 2016; 
Sperling et al. 2016), and protozoans (Bernhard and Reimers, 1991; 
Gooday et al. 2000; Mofﬁtt et al. 2014) (high conﬁdence). Shoaling 
oxyclines on continental slopes have altered depth distributions 
of multiple co-occurring echinoid species over the past 25 years 
(Sato et al. 2017) and can reduce the growth rate, and change the 
skeletal structure and biochemical composition of a common sea 
urchin (Sato et  al. 2018). In central Paciﬁc oceanic canyons, ﬁsh 
abundance and diversity are reduced at 4 to 5 times higher oxygen 
concentrations than on continental slopes (<31 μMol  kg–1  O2) 
(De  Leo et  al. 2012). Low oxygen on continental slopes causes 
reductions in faunal body size and bioturbation (Diaz and Rosenberg, 
1995; Levin, 2003; Middelburg and Levin, 2009; Sturdivant et  al. 
2012), simpliﬁcation of trophic structure reducing energy ﬂow to 
upper trophic levels (Sperling et al. 2013), shifts in carbon processing 
pathways from metazoans to protozoans (Woulds et al. 2009), and 
reduced colonisation potential (Levin et  al. 2013). These changes 
are expected to lead to altered ecosystem structure and function, 
with lower carbon burial (Smith et al. 2000; Levin and Dayton, 2009) 
(medium conﬁdence). Both carbon sequestration and nitrogen 
recycling are highly sensitive to small changes in oxygenation within 
the suboxic zone (Deutsch et al. 2011).
Bathyal species adapted to OMZs where CO2 levels are characteristically 
high, appear less vulnerable to the negative impacts of ocean 
acidiﬁcation (Taylor et  al. 2014). Benthic foraminifera, which are 
often the numerically dominant deep sea taxon, show no signiﬁcant 
effect of short-term exposure to ocean acidiﬁcation on survival of 
multiple species (Dissard et al. 2010; Haynert et al. 2011; Keul et al. 
2013; McIntyre-Wressnig et  al. 2014; Wit et  al. 2016) and in fact 
hypoxia in combination with elevated pCO2 favors survival of some 
foraminifera (Wit et al. 2016). However, lower pH exacerbates shallow 
foraminiferal sensitivity to warming (Webster et  al. 2016). Limited 
evidence suggests that combined declines in pH and oxygen may lead 
to increase in some agglutinating taxa and a decrease in carbonate-
producing foraminifera, including those using carbonate cement (van 
Dijk et  al. 2017). Exposure to acidiﬁcation (0.4 unit  pH  decrease)

reduces fecundity and embryo development rate in a  bathyal 
polychaete. Where both oxygen and CO2 stress occur together on 
bathyal slopes, oxygen can be the primary driver of change (Taylor 
et al. 2014; Sato et al. 2018). Nematodes are sensitive to changes in 
temperature (Danovaro et al. 2001; Danovaro et al. 2004; Yodnarasri 
et al. 2008) and elevated CO2 (Barry et al. 2004; Fleeger et al. 2006; 
Fleeger et al. 2010). There is low agreement about the direction of 
meiofaunal responses among studies, reﬂecting opposing responses 
in different regions. However, there is high agreement that meiofauna 
are sensitive to change in environment and food supply (medium 
conﬁdence). Additional research is needed across all taxa on how 
hypoxia and pH interact (Gobler and Baumann, 2016).
Continental slopes, seamounts and canyons (200–2500 m) are 
projected to experience signiﬁcant warming, pH decline, oxygen loss 
and decline in POC ﬂux by 2081–2100 (compared to 1951–2000) 
under RCP8.5 (Table 5.5). In contrast, the average changes are 
projected to be 30–50% less under RCP2.6 (Table 5.5) by 2081–2100. 
Most ocean regions at bathyal depths (200–2500 m) except the 
Southern and Arctic Oceans are predicted to experience on average 
declining export POC ﬂux under RCP8.5 by 2081–2100 (Yool et al. 
2017; FAO, 2019) with the largest declines of 0.7–8.1 mg C m–2 d–1 in 
the Northeast Atlantic (FAO, 2019). There is a strong macroecological 
relationship between depth, export POC ﬂux, biomass and zonation 
of macrobenthos on continental slopes (Wei et al. 2011), such that 
lower POC ﬂuxes will alter seaﬂoor community biomass and structure 
(medium conﬁdence) (See also Section 5.2.4.1). This is modiﬁed on 
the local scale by near-bottom currents, which alter sediment grain 
size, food availability, and larval dispersal (Wei et al. 2011).
Declines in faunal biomass (6.1 ± 1.6% 95% C.I) are predicted for 
96.6 ± 1.2% of seamounts under RCP8.5 by 2091–2100 relative to 
2006–2015, driven by a projected 13.8 ± 3.3% drop in POC ﬂux (Jones 
et al. 2014). The majority (85%) of mapped canyons are projected to 
experience comparable benthic biomass declines (Jones et al. 2014). 
By 2100 under RCP8.5, pH reductions exceeding -0.2 pH units are 
projected in ~23% of north Atlantic deep sea canyons and 8% of 
seamounts (Gehlen et al. 2014), with potential negative consequences 
for their cold water coral habitats (See Box 5.2).
Mean temperature (warming) signals are projected to emerge from 
background variability before 2040 in canyons of the Antarctic, 
northwest  Atlantic, and South Paciﬁc (FAO, 2019). Enhanced 
stratiﬁcation and change in the intensity and frequency of downwelling 
processes under atmospheric forcing (including storms and density-
driven cascading events would alter organic matter transported 
through canyons (Allen and Durrieu de Madron, 2009) (low conﬁdence). 
Changes in the quantity and quality of transferred particulate organic 
matter, as well as physical disturbance during extreme events cause 
a complex combination of positive and negative impacts at different 
depths along the canyon ﬂoor (Canals et  al. 2006; Pusceddu et  al. 
2010). Canyons and slopes are recognised as hosting many methane 
seeps and other chemosynthetic habitats (e.g., whale and wood falls) 
supported by massive transport of terrestrial organic matter (Pruski 
et al. 2017); their climate vulnerabilities are discussed below.
Seamounts have been proposed to serve as refugia for cold water 
corals facing shoaling aragonite saturation horizons (Tittensor et al. 
2011), but could become too warm for deep-water corals in some 
regions (e.g., projections off Australia) (Thresher et al. 2015) (one 
study, low conﬁdence). Seamounts are major spawning grounds for 
ﬁshes; reproduction on seamounts may be disrupted by warming 
(Henry et al. 2016) (one study, low conﬁdence). In the north Atlantic, 
models suggest seamounts are an important source of cold water 
coral larvae that maintain resilience under shifting NAO conditions 
(Fox et al. 2016), thus loss of suitable seamount habitat may have 
far-reaching consequences (Gehlen et  al. 2014) (low conﬁdence) 
(also see Box 5.2).
Table 5.5 |  Projected climate changes from the present to 2081–2100 given as mean (min, max) at the deep seaﬂoor for continental slopes, canyons, seamounts and 
cold water corals mapped from 200–2500 m under RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 Projections are based on three 3D, fully coupled earth system models (ESMs) (as part of CMIP5):

5.2.4.4 
Chemosynthetic Ecosystems 
Despite having nutrition derived largely from chemosynthetic 
sources fueled by ﬂuids from the earth’s interior, hydrothermal 
vent and methane seep ecosystems are linked to surface ocean 
environments and water-column processes in many ways that can 
expose them to aspects of climate change (medium conﬁdence). The 
reliance of vent and seep mussels on surface-derived photosynthetic 
production to supplement chemosynthetic food sources (Riou et al. 
2010; Riekenberg et al. 2016; Demopoulos et al. 2019), and in some 
cases as a cue for synchronised gametogenesis (sperm and egg 
production) (Dixon et al. 2006; Tyler et al. 2007) can make them 
vulnerable to changing amounts or timing of POC ﬂux to the deep 
seabed in most areas except high latitudes, or to changes in timing 
of surface production (see Section 5.2.2.5) (limited evidence) Most 
of the large, habitat-forming (foundation) species at vents and seeps 
such as mussels, tubeworms, and clams require oxygen to serve 
as electron acceptor for aerobic hydrogen-, sulﬁde- and methane 
oxidation (Dubilier et al. 2008) and appear unable to grow under 
dysoxic conditions (<5–10 μmol kg–1 O2) (Sweetman et al. 2017) 
(medium conﬁdence). The distributions of these taxa at seeps could 
be constrained by climate-driven expansion of midwater oxygen 
minima (Stramma et  al. 2008; Schmidtko et  al. 2017), which is 
occurring at water depths where seep ecosystems typically occur 
on continental margins (200–1000 m). Rising bottom temperatures 
or shifting of warm currents on continental margins could increase 
dissociation of buried gas hydrates on margins (Phrampus 
and Hornbach, 2012) (low conﬁdence) potentially intensifying 
anaerobic methane oxidation (which produces hydrogen sulﬁde) 
(Boetius and Wenzhoefer, 2013) and expanding cover of methane 
seep communities (limited evidence). Larvae of vent species such 
as bathymodiolin mussels, alvinocarid shrimp, and some limpets 
that develop in or near surface waters (Herring and Dixon, 1998; 
Arellano et al. 2014), are likely to be exposed to warming waters, 
decreasing pH and carbonate saturation states, and in some places, 
reduced phytoplankton availability (Section 5.2.2), causing reduced 
calciﬁcation and growth rates (as in shallow water mussel larvae, 
Frieder et  al. (2014)) (limited evidence, low conﬁdence). Larvae 
originating at vents or seeps beneath upwelling regions may also 
be impaired by effects of hypoxia associated with expanding OMZ 
(Stramma et  al. 2008) during migration to the surface (limited 
evidence). Warming and its effects on climate cycles have the 
potential to alter patterns of larval transport and population 
connectivity through changes in circulation (Fox et al. 2016) or surface 
generated mesoscale eddies (Adams et al. 2011) (limited evidence; 
low conﬁdence). Climate-induced changes in the distribution and 
cover of vent and seep foundation species may involve alteration 
of attachment substrate, food and refuge for the many habitat-
endemic species that rely on them (Cordes et al. 2010) and for the 
surrounding deep sea ecosystems which interact through transport 
of nutrients and microbes, movement of vagrant predators and 
scavengers, and plankton interactions (Levin et al. 2016) (limited 
evidence; low conﬁdence). There is, however, insufﬁcient analysis of 
faunal symbiont and nutritional requirements, life histories, larval 
transport and cross-system interaction to quantify the extent of the 
consequences described above under future climate conditions. 
Box 5.2 |  Cold Water Corals and Sponges 
Cold water corals and sponges form large reefs at the deep seaﬂoor mostly between 200–1500 m, creating complex 3D habitat 
that supports high biodiversity; they are found at the highest densities on hard substrates of continental slopes, canyons, and 
seamounts (Buhl-Mortensen et al. 2010). The meta-analysis reported in AR5 Chapter 6 Table 6–3 (Pörtner et al. 2014), identiﬁes 
10 studies involving 6 species of cold water corals that suggest low vulnerability to CO2 changes at RCP6.0 and medium vulnerability 
at RCP8.5, with negative effects starting at pCO2 of 445 μatm. 
Scleractinian corals have the capacity to acclimate to high CO2 conditions due to their capacity to upregulate the pH at the calciﬁcation 
site (Form and Riebesell, 2011; Rodolfo-Metalpa et al. 2015; Gori et al. 2016). The most widely distributed, habitat-forming species in 
deep water (e.g., Lophelia pertusa [renamed Desmophyllum pertusum) (Addamo et al. 2016) can continue to calcify at aragonite 
undersaturation and high CO2 levels projected for 2100 (750–1100 uatm) based on experiments (Georgian et al. 2016; Kurman 
et al. 2017) and observations along the natural gradient of carbon chemistry in their distributions (Fillinger and Richter, 2013; Movilla 
et al. 2014; Baco et al. 2017) (Appendix 1) (robust evidence, medium agreement, medium conﬁdence) and thus appear to be able to 
acclimate to rising CO2 levels (Hennige et al. 2015). However, net calciﬁcation rates (difference between calciﬁcation and dissolution) 
of L. pertusa exposed to aragonite-undersaturated conditions (Ωarag < 1, where Ωarag = aragonite saturation state) often decreases 
to close to zero or even becomes negative (Lunden et al. 2014; Hennige et al. 2015; Büscher et al. 2017), with genetic variability 
underpinning ability to calcify at low aragonite saturation states (Kurman et al. 2017). Additionally, skeletons become longer, thinner 
and weaker (Hennige et al. 2015), and bioerosion is enhanced (e.g., by bacteria, fungi, annelids and sponges) (Schönberg et al. 2017), 
exacerbating effects of dissolution of the skeleton. L. pertusa can calcify when exposed to multiple environmental stresses in the 
laboratory (Hennige et al. 2015; Büscher et al. 2017), but cannot survive with warming above water temperatures of 14ºC–15ºC or 
oxygen concentrations below 1.6 ml l–1 in the Gulf of Mexico, 3.3 ml l–1 in the north Atlantic, 2 ml l–1 in the Mediterranean, and 0.5–1. 
5 ml l–1 in the SE Atlantic (Brooke et al. 2013; Lunden et al. 2014; Hanz et al. 2019), highlighting the existence of critical thresholds for 
cold water coral populations living at the edge of their tolerance. The role of temporal dynamics, species-speciﬁc thermal tolerances, and 
food availability in mediating the response to combinations of stressors is recognised but is still poorly studied under in situ conditions 
(Lartaud et al. 2014; Naumann et al. 2014; Baco et al. 2017).

Box 5.2 (continued)
Sponges also form critical habitat in the deep ocean but are much less well studied than cold-water corals with respect to climate 
change. The geologic record, modern distributions and evolutionary and metabolic pathways suggest that sponges are more tolerant 
to warm temperatures, high CO2 and low oxygen than are cold-water corals (Schulz et al. 2013). One habitat forming, deep sea 
sponge along with its microbiome (microbial inhabitants) has been shown in laboratory experiments to tolerate a 5ºC increase in 
temperature, albeit with evidence of stress (Strand et al. 2017), while ocean acidiﬁcation (pH 7.5) reduces the feeding of two deep sea 
demosponge taxa (Robertson et al. 2017). 
Generally, the deep sea areas where cold water corals may be found are projected to be exposed to multiple climate hazards in the 
21st century because of the projected ocean warming, oxygen loss, and decrease in POC ﬂux (Table 5.5) under scenarios of greenhouse 
gas emissions. The average changes in these climate hazards for coral-water corals are projected to be almost halved under RCP2.6 
relative to RCP8.5 (Table 5.5). Under RCP8.5, 95 ± 2% (95% CI) of cold-water coral habitats are projected to experience animal 
biomass decline (–8.6 ± 2.0%) globally by 2091–2100 relative to 2006–2015, driven by a projected 21 ± 9% drop in POC ﬂux 
(medium conﬁdence) (Jones et al. 2014). However, nutritional co-reliance of cold-water corals on zooplankton (Höfer et al. 2018) 
and carbon ﬁxation by symbiotic microbes (Middelburg et al. 2015), is not incorporated into the models, adding uncertainty to these 
estimates. Regionally, suitable habitat for coral-water corals in the NE Atlantic is projected to decrease with multiple climatic 
hazards (warming, acidiﬁcation, decreases in oxygen and POC ﬂux) under RCP8.5 for 2081–2100 (FAO, 2019), with up to 98% loss 
of suitable habitat by 2099 due to shoaling aragonite saturation horizons. In the Southern hemisphere, a tolerance threshold of 7ºC 
and decline of aragonite saturation below that required for survival (Ωarag <0.84) can cause large loss of cold water corals habitat 
(Solenosmilia variabilis) on seamounts off Australia and New Zealand under future projections of warming and acidiﬁcation to 2099 
at RCP4.5 and nearly complete loss under RCP8.5 (Thresher et al. 2015). 
Overall, cold water corals can survive conditions of aragonite-undersaturation associated with ocean acidiﬁcation but sensitivity 
varies among species and skeletons will be weakened (medium conﬁdence). The largest impacts on calciﬁcation and growth will occur 
when aragonite saturation is accompanied by warming and/or decrease in oxygen concentration beyond the tolerance limits of these 
corals (medium conﬁdence). Given present day occurrence of 95% of cold water corals above the aragonite saturation horizon 
(Guinotte et al. 2006) and that no adaptation has been detected with regard to increased dissolution of exposed aragonite (Eyre et al. 
2014), there is limited scope for the non-living components of cold water corals and for the large, non-living reef framework that 
comprises deep water reefs to avoid dissolution under RCP8.5 in the 21st century (high conﬁdence). Multiple climatic hazards of 
warming, deoxygenation, aragonite under-saturation and decrease in POC ﬂux are projected to negatively affect cold water corals 
worldwide from the present day by 2100 (high conﬁdence). Uncertainty remains in the adaptive capacity of living cold water corals 
to cope with these changes and in the inﬂuence of altered regional current patterns on connectivity (Fox et al. 2016; Roberts et al. 
2017). Sponges and the habitat they form may be less vulnerable than cold water corals to warming, acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation 
that will occur under RCP8.5 in 2100 (low conﬁdence). 
5.2.5 
Risk Assessment of Open Ocean Ecosystems
This section synthesises the assessment of climate impacts on open 
ocean and deep seaﬂoor ecosystem structure and functioning and the 
levels of risk under future conditions of global warming (see SM5.2). 
The format for Figure 5.16 matches that of Figure 19.4 of AR5 (Pörtner 
et al. 2014) and Figure 3.20 of SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), 
indicating the levels of additional risk as colours (white, yellow, red 
and purple). Each column in Figure 5.16 indicates how risks increase 
with ocean warming, acidiﬁcation (OA), deoxygenation, and POC ﬂux 
with a focus on present day conditions (2000s) and future conditions 
by the year 2100 under low (RCP2.6) and high (RCP8.5) CO2 emission 
scenarios. The transition between the levels of risk to each type of 
ecosystem is estimated from key evidence assessed in earlier parts of 
this chapter (Sections 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4). SST is chosen to provide an 
indication of the changes in all these variables because it is closely 
related to cumulative carbon emission (Gattuso et al. 2015) which 
is the main climatic driver of the hazards. SST scales with Global 
Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) by a factor of 1.44 according to 
changes in an ensemble of RCP8.5 simulations; with an uncertainty 
of about 4% in this scaling factor based on differences between the 
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The transition values may have an 
error of ±0.3ºC depending on the consensus of expert judgment. The 
deep seaﬂoor embers are generated based on earth system model 
projection of climate variables to the seaﬂoor under RCP2.6 and 
RCP8.5 scenarios, and then translated to RCP associated change in 
SST. The assessed conﬁdence in assigning the levels of risk at present 
day and future scenarios are low, medium, high and very high levels 
of conﬁdence. A detailed account of the procedures involved in the 
ember for each type of ecosystem, such as their exposure to climate 
hazards, sensitivity of key biotic and abiotic components, natural 
adaptive capacity, observed impacts and projected risks, and regional 
hotspots of vulnerability is provided in the SM5.2 and Table 5.5. 
The risk assessment for cold water corals is in agreement with the 
conclusions in AR5 Chapter 6.3.1.4.1, although more recent literature 
is assessed in Box 5.2 and Table SM5.5.

Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

Overall, the upper ocean (0−700 m) and 700−2000 m layers 
have both warmed from 2004 to 2016 (virtually certain) and the 
abyssal ocean continues to warm in the Southern Hemisphere 
(high conﬁdence). The ocean is stratifying; observed warming and 
high-latitude freshening are both surface intensiﬁed trends making 
the surface ocean lighter at a faster rate than deeper in the ocean 
(high conﬁdence) (Section 5.2.2.2). It is very likely that stratiﬁcation 
in the upper few hundred meters of the ocean will increase 
signiﬁcantly in the 21st century.  It is virtually certain that ocean 
pH is declining by ~0.02 pH units per decade where time series 
observations exist (Section 5.2.2.3). The anthropogenic pH signal 
has already emerged over the entire surface ocean (high conﬁdence) 
and emission scenarios are the most important control of surface 
ocean pH relative to internal variability for most of the 21st century 
at both global and local scale (virtually certain). The oxygen content 
of the global ocean has declined by about 0.5−3.3% in 0−1000 m 
layer (Section  5.2.2.4).  Over the next century oxygen declines of 
3.5% by 2100 are predicted by CMIP5 models globally (medium 
conﬁdence), with low conﬁdence at regional scales, especially in the 
tropics. The largest changes in the deep sea will occur after 2100 
(Section 5.2.2.3). CMIP5 models project a decrease in global NPP 
(medium conﬁdence) with increases in high-latitude (low conﬁdence) 
and decreases in low latitude (medium conﬁdence) (Section 5.2.2.6) 
in response to changes in ocean nutrient supply (Section 5.2.2.5). 
These models also project reductions by 8.9−15.8% in the globally 
integrated POC ﬂux for RCP8.5, with decreases in tropical regions 
and increases at higher latitudes (medium conﬁdence), affecting 
the organic carbon supply to the deep sea ﬂoor ecosystems (high 
conﬁdence) (Section 5.2.2.6). However, there is low conﬁdence on 
the mechanistic understanding of how climatic drivers will affect 
the different components of the biological pump in the epipelagic 
ocean (Table 5.4). Therefore, the exposure to hazard for epipelagic 
ecosystems ranges from moderate (RCP2.6) to high (RCP8.5), with 
uncertain effects and tolerance of planktonic organisms, ﬁshes and 
large vertebrates to interactive climate stressors. Major risks are 
predicted for declining productivity and ﬁsh biomass in tropical and 
subtropical waters (RCP8.5) (SM5.2). 
The climatic hazards for pelagic organisms from plankton to mammals 
are driving changes in eco-physiology, biogeography and ecology 
and biodiversity (high conﬁdence) (Section 5.2.3.1). Observed and 
projected population declines in the equator-ward range boundary 
(medium conﬁdence), expansion in the poleward boundary (high 
conﬁdence), earlier timing of biological events (high conﬁdence), 
overall shift species composition (high conﬁdence) and decreases in 
animal biomass (medium conﬁdence), are consistent with expected 
responses to climate change (Section 5.2.3; Figure 5.13). It is likely 
that increased OA has not yet caused sufﬁcient reduction in ﬁtness to 
decrease abundances of calcifying phytoplankton and zooplankton, 
but is very likely (high conﬁdence) that calcifying planktonic organisms 
will experience great decreases in abundance and diversity under 
high emission scenarios by the end of the century. Therefore, impacts 
to the epipelagic ecosystems are already observed in the present 
day (Figure 5.16). Based on simulation modelling and experimental 
ﬁndings, the combined effects of warming, ocean deoxygenation, OA 
and changes in NPP in the 21st century are projected to exacerbate 
the impacts on the growth, reproduction and mortality of ﬁshes, and 
consequently increase the risk of population decline (high conﬁdence) 
(Section 5.2.3.1). There may be some capacity for adjustment and 
evolutionary adaptation that lowers their sensitivity to warming and 
decrease in oxygen (low conﬁdence). However, historical responses 
in abundance and ranges of marine ﬁshes to ocean warming and 
decrease in oxygen in the past suggest that adaptation is not always 
sufﬁcient to mitigate the observed impacts (medium conﬁdence) 
(Section 5.2.3) (SM5.2). 
Despite its remoteness, most of the deep seaﬂoor ecosystems 
already have or are projected to experience rising temperatures and 
declining oxygen, pH and POC ﬂux beyond natural variability within 
the next half century (See Section 5.2.4). On slopes, seamounts 
and canyons these changes are projected to be much larger under 
RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6 (high conﬁdence), with greatest effects 
on seaﬂoor community diversity and function from expansion of low 
oxygen zones and aragonite undersaturation (medium conﬁdence). 
As critical thresholds of temperature, oxygen and CO2 are exceeded, 
coral species will alter their depth distributions, non-living carbonate 
will experience dissolution and bioerosion, and stress will be 
exacerbated by lower food supply. These changes are projected to 
cause loss of cold water coral habitat with highest climate hazard 
in the Arctic and north Atlantic Ocean (medium conﬁdence), while 
sponges may be more tolerant (Box 5.2) (low conﬁdence). Projected 
changes in food supply to the seaﬂoor at abyssal depths combined 
with warmer temperatures are anticipated to cause reductions in 
biomass and body size (medium conﬁdence) that could affect the 
carbon cycle in this century under RCP8.5 (low conﬁdence). Even 
at hydrothermal vents and methane seeps, some dominant species 
such as mussels may be vulnerable to reduced photosynthetically-
based food supply or have planktonic larvae or oxidising symbionts 
that are negatively affected by warming, acidiﬁcation and oxygen 
loss (low conﬁdence). 
Widespread attributes of deep seaﬂoor fauna (e.g., great longevity, 
high levels of habitat specialisation including well-deﬁned 
physiological 
tolerances 
and 
thresholds, 
dependence 
on 
environmental triggers for reproduction, and highly developed 
mutualistic interactions) can increase the vulnerability of selected 
taxa to changing conditions (FAO, 2019) (medium conﬁdence). 
However, some deep sea taxa (e.g.,  foraminifera and nematodes) 
may be more resilient to environmental change than their shallow-
water counterparts (low conﬁdence). Observations, experiments and 
model projections indicate that impacts of climate change have or 
are expected to take place in this century, indicating a transition 
from undetectable risk to moderate risk at <1.5ºC warming of sea 
surface temperature for continental slope, canyon and seamount 
habitats, and for cold water corals (Figure 5.16). Emergence of risk is 
expected to occur later at around the mid-21st century under RCP8.5 
for abyssal plain and chemosynthetic ecosystems (vents and seeps) 
(Figure 5.16). All deep seaﬂoor ecosystems are expected to be subject 
to at least moderate risk under RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century, 
with cold water corals experiencing a transition from moderate to 
high risk below 3ºC (SM5.2).

5.3 
Changing Coastal Ecosystems 
and Biodiversity
The world’s shelf seas and coastal waters (hereafter ‘coastal seas’) 
extend from the coastline to the 200 m water depth contour. They 
encompass diverse ecosystems, including estuaries, sandy beaches, 
kelp forests, mangroves and coral reefs. Although they occupy a small 
part of the global ocean (7.6%), coastal seas provide up to 30% of 
global marine primary production and about 50% of the organic carbon 
supplied to the deep ocean (Chen, 2003; Bauer et al. 2013) (Sections 
5.2.4.1 and 5.4.1.1). Coastal seas include several frontal and upwelling 
areas (Box 5.3) that support high ﬁsheries yields (Scales et al. 2014), and 
productive coastal ecosystems, such as wetlands (McLeod et al. 2011). 
Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and kelp forests form important 
habitats supporting high biodiversity while offering opportunities for 
climate change mitigation and adaptation (Section 5.5.1.2) (Duarte 
et  al. 2013), with mangrove forests providing physical protection 
against extreme events such as storms and ﬂoods (Kelleway et  al. 
2017a) (Sections 5.4.1.2 and 4.3.3.5.4). The regional characteristics 
and habitat heterogeneity of many coastal seas support endemic fauna 
and ﬂora (e.g., seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean), which makes 
them particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts with high risk 
of diversity loss and alterations in ecosystem structure and functioning 
(Rilov, 2016; Chefaoui et al. 2018).
Near-shore coastal ecosystems are classiﬁed by their geomorphological 
structure (e.g.,  estuaries, sandy beaches and rocky shores) or 
foundation species (e.g., salt marshes, seagrass meadows, mangrove 
forests, coral reefs and kelp forests). All these coastal ecosystems 
are threatened to a varying degree by SLR, warming, acidiﬁcation, 
deoxygenation and extreme weather events (Sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.7). 
Unlike the open ocean where detection and attribution of climate 
driven-physical and chemical changes are robust (Section 5.2.2), 
coastal ecosystems display regional complexity that can render the 
conclusive detection and attribution of climate effects uncertain. 
The hydrological complexity of coastal ecosystems that affects their 
biota is driven by the interactions between the land (e.g.,  river 
and groundwater discharges), the sea (e.g.,  circulation, tides) 
(Section  5.2.2.2.3) and seabed structures and substrates (Sharples 
et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018; Laurent et al. 2018; Zahid et al. 2018).
Additionally, the high density of human populations on coastal land 
causes most of the adjacent marine ecosystems to be impacted by 
local anthropogenic disturbances such as eutrophication, coastline 
modiﬁcations, pollution and overﬁshing (Levin et al. 2015; Diop and 
Scheren, 2016; Maavara et al. 2017; Dunn et al. 2018) (Section 4.3.2.2, 
Cross-Chapter Box 9). Climate driven impacts interact with such 
human disturbances and pose a serious risk to ecosystems structure 
and functioning (Gattuso et  al. 2015). Projections of the ecological 
impacts of climate change in coastal ecosystems must therefore deal 
with many emerging complexities such as the differentiation between 
the long-term climate trends (e.g., progressive ocean acidiﬁcation) and 
the short-term natural ﬂuctuations (Boyd et al. 2018), ranging from the 
seasons to interannual climate oscillations like El Niño. The ‘time of 
emergence’ for speciﬁc climate drivers to exceed background variability 
varies between ecosystems and is strongly sensitive to projected 
emission scenarios (Hammond et al. 2017; Reusch et al. 2018) (Box 5.1).
This section summarises our updated understanding of ecological and 
functional changes that coastal ecosystems are experiencing due to 
multiple climate and non-climatic human drivers, and their synergies. 
Additional experimental and long-term observational evidence since 
AR5 WGII (Wong et  al. 2014a) and SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 
2018) improves the attribution of impacts on all the types of coastal 
ecosystems assessed here to climate trends (Sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.6). 
Moreover, the emergent impacts detected in the present strengthen 
the projection of risk of each ecosystem under future emission 
scenarios by 2100, depending on their exposure to different climate 
hazards (Section 5.3.7).
5.3.1 
Estuaries
Estuarine ecosystems are deﬁned by the river-sea interface that 
provides high habitat heterogeneity and supports high biodiversity 
across freshwater and subtidal zones (Basset et al. 2013). AR5 WGII 
(Wong et al. 2014a) and SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018) concluded 
that estuarine ecosystems have been impacted by SLR and human 
inﬂuences that drive salinisation, resulting in increased ﬂooding, land 
degradation and erosion of coastal areas around estuaries.
Observations since AR5 provide further evidence that SLR increases 
seawater intrusions and raises salinity in estuaries. Salinisation of 
estuaries can be exacerbated by droughts and modiﬁcations of 
drainage area by human activities (Ross et al. 2015; Cardoso-Mohedano 
et al. 2018; Hallett et al. 2018; Zahid et al. 2018). The changing salinity 
gradients in estuaries have been linked to the observed upstream 
expansion of brackish and marine benthic and pelagic communities, 
and a reduction in the diversity and richness of freshwater fauna 
(Robins et al. 2016; Raimonet and Cloern, 2017; Hallett et al. 2018; 
Addino et  al. 2019) (medium conﬁdence). However, because the 
distribution of benthic species in estuaries is strongly determined by 
sediment properties like grain size, the gradient of sediment types in 
estuaries can be a barrier to upstream shifts of brackish and marine 
benthic biota, leading to a reduction in species richness in mid- to 
upper-estuarine areas and altering food webs (Little et  al. 2017; 
Hudson et al. 2018; Addino et al. 2019). Similarly, estuarine wetlands 
(Section 5.3.2) and tidal ﬂats (Murray et al. 2019) have reduced their 
extent and productivity in response to increased salinity, inundation 
and wave exposure, especially in areas with limited capacity 
for soil accretion or inland migration due to coastal squeezing 
(Sections  4.3.2.3, 5.3.2) (high conﬁdence). Poleward migration of 
tropical and sub-tropical biota between estuaries has been observed 
in response to warming (Hallett et al. 2018) (medium conﬁdence), in 
agreement with the global trend of biogeographic shifts of marine 
organisms (Sections 5.2.3.1.1; 5.3.2−5.3.6).
Intensive human activities around estuaries and river deltas 
worldwide has substantially increased nutrient and organic matter 
inputs into such systems since the 1970s (Maavara et  al. 2017). 
Increased organic matter accumulation has been shown to interact 
with warming, resulting in intensiﬁcation of bacterial degradation 
and eutrophication (Maavara et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2018; Fennel and 
Testa, 2019), contributing to an increase in the frequency and extent 
of hypoxic zones (Breitberg et al. 2015; Gobler and Baumann, 2016). 
494
Chapter 5 
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

The interaction between warming, increased nutrient loading, and 
hypoxia has shown to be related to the increased occurrences of HABs 
(Anderson et al. 2015; Paerl et al. 2018) (Box 5.4) (high conﬁdence), 
pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio species (Baker-Austin et al. 2017; 
Kopprio et al. 2017) (Section 5.4.2) (low conﬁdence), and mortalities 
of invertebrates and ﬁsh communities (Jeppesen et al. 2018; Warwick 
et al. 2018) (medium conﬁdence).
Fluctuations in estuarine salinity, turbidity and nutrient gradients 
are inﬂuenced by changes in precipitation and wind-stress caused 
by large-scale climatic variations such as the ENSO, the NAO and the 
South Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (SAMOC) which 
have shown persistent anomalies associated with climate change 
since the 1970s (Wang and Cai, 2013; Delworth and Zeng, 2016; 
García-Moreiras et al. 2018). Similarly, storm surges and heat waves 
have increased nutrients and sediment loads in estuaries (Tweedley 
et  al. 2016; Arias-Ortiz et  al. 2018; Chen et  al. 2018). Sustained 
long-term observations (15−40 years) provide evidence that 
large-scale climatic variations and extreme events affect plankton 
phenology and composition in estuaries worldwide with regional 
differences in the characteristics of the responses (Thompson et al. 
2015; Abreu et al. 2017; Marques et al. 2017; Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018; 
López-Abbate et al. 2019) (high conﬁdence). Although these changes 
in ecosystem components may be attributed to climate variability 
(Box 5.1), they demonstrate the sensitivity of estuarine ecosystems 
to climate change. Also, these large-scale climate events are likely 
to be intensiﬁed in the 21st century (Stocker, 2014) (Section 6.5.1).
Salinisation in estuaries is projected to continue in response to SLR, 
warming and droughts under global warming greater than 1.5ºC (high 
conﬁdence), and will pose further risks to ecosystems biodiversity and 
functioning (Zhou et al. 2017; Hallett et al. 2018; Zahid et al. 2018; 
Elliott et al. 2019) (Section 4.3.3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7) (medium 
conﬁdence). Estuarine wetlands are resilient to modest rates of SLR 
due to their sediment relocation capacity, but such adaptation is not 
expected to keep pace with projected rates of SLR under the RCP8.5 
climate scenario (Section 5.3.2) (high conﬁdence). Moreover, human 
activities that inhibit sediment movement and deposition in coastal 
deltas increase the likelihood of their shrinking as a result of SLR 
(Brown et al. 2018b; Schuerch et al. 2018) (medium conﬁdence).
Oxygen-depleted dead zones in coastal areas are already a problem; 
they are projected to increase under the co-occurrence and 
intensiﬁcation of climate threats and eutrophication (Breitburg 
et  al. 2018; Laurent et  al. 2018) (Section 5.2.2.4). While warming 
is the primary climate driver of deoxygenation in the open ocean, 
eutrophication is projected to increase in estuaries due to human 
activities and intensiﬁed precipitation increasing riverine nitrogen 
loads under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, both mid-century 
(2031–2060) and later (2071–2100) (Sinha et al. 2017). Moreover, 
enhanced stratiﬁcation in estuaries in response to warming is also 
expected to increase the risk of hypoxia through reduced vertical 
mixing (Du et al. 2018; Hallett et al. 2018; Warwick et al. 2018).The 
effects of warming will be more pronounced on high-latitude and 
temperate shallow estuaries with limited exchange with the open 
ocean (e.g., Río de La Plata Estuary, Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay) 
and seasonality that already leads to dead zone development when 
summertime temperatures reach critical values (e.g.,  Black  Sea) 
(Altieri and Gedan, 2015) (medium conﬁdence). The coastal 
acidiﬁcation related to this expansion of hypoxic zones (Zhang and 
Gao, 2016; Cai et  al. 2017; Laurent et  al. 2017) imposes risk for 
sensitive organisms (Beck et al. 2011; Duarte et al. 2013; Feely et al. 
2016; Carstensen et al. 2018).
The interaction of SLR and changes in precipitation will have a more 
severe impact on shallow estuaries (<10 m) than on deep basin estuaries 
(>10 m) (Hallett et al. 2018; Elliott et al. 2019) (medium conﬁdence). 
For a projected SLR of 1 m, climate-related risks for shallow estuaries 
ecosystems are estimated to increase through increased tidal current 
amplitudes (by 5% on average), energy dissipation, vertical mixing 
and salinity intrusion (Prandle and Lane, 2015). Estuaries with high 
tidal exchanges and associated well-developed sediment areas are 
more resilient to global climate changes than estuaries with low tidal 
exchanges and sediment supply, since the latter are more vulnerable 
to SLR and changes in river ﬂow (Brown et al. 2018b; Warwick et al. 
2018) (medium conﬁdence). 
Overall, this assessment concludes that there is evidence of upstream 
redistribution of marine biotic communities in estuaries driven by 
increased sea water intrusion (medium conﬁdence). Such distribution 
shifts are limited by physical barriers such as the availability of benthic 
substrates leading to reduction of suitable habitats for estuarine 
communities (medium conﬁdence). Warming has led to poleward 
range shifts of biota between estuaries (medium conﬁdence). 
Increased nutrient inputs from intensive human development in 
deltas increases bacterial respiration, which in turn is exacerbated 
by warming, leading to an expansion of suboxic and anoxic areas 
(high conﬁdence). These changes reduce the survival of estuarine 
animals (medium conﬁdence), and increase the occurrence of HABs 
and pathogenic microbes (medium conﬁdence). Projected warming, 
SLR and tidal changes in the 21st century will continue to expand 
salinisation and hypoxia in estuaries (medium conﬁdence). These 
impacts will be more pronounced under higher emission scenarios, 
and in temperate and high-latitude estuaries that are eutrophic, 
shallow and that naturally have low sediment supply.
5.3.2 
Coastal Wetlands (Salt Marshes, Seagrass 
Meadows and Mangrove Forests)
Coastal vegetated wetlands include salt marshes, mangrove forests 
and subtidal seagrass meadows ecosystems, considered to be the 
main ‘blue carbon’ habitats (Sections 5.4.1 and 5.5.1.1) (McLeod 
et al. 2011). AR5 WGII and SR15 concluded that wetland salinisation 
is occurring at a large geographic scale (high conﬁdence); that rising 
water temperatures has led to shifts in plant species distribution 
(medium conﬁdence) (Wong et al. 2014b); and that SLR and storms 
are causing wetland erosion and habitat loss, enhanced by human 
disturbances (high conﬁdence) (Section 4.3.3.5.1) (Wong et  al. 
2014b). This section assesses new evidence since AR5 and SR15 
of observed climate impacts and future risks of these vegetated 
wetlands in terms of their role in supporting biodiversity and key 
ecosystem functions. The recent literature conﬁrms and strengthens 
the SR15 conclusions (Section 5.3.7 and Figure 5.16).

Chapter 5

Nearly 50% of the pre-industrial, natural extent of global coastal 
wetlands have been lost since the 19th century (Li et al. 2018a). Such 
a reduction in wetlands is primarily caused by non-climatic drivers 
such as alteration of drainage, agriculture development, coastal 
settlement, hydrological alterations and reductions in sediment 
supply (Adam, 2002; Wang et al. 2014; Kroeger et al. 2017; Thomas 
et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018a). However, large-scale mortality events 
of mangroves from ‘natural causes’ has also occurred globally since 
the 1960s; ~70% of this loss has resulted from low frequency, 
high intensity weather events, such as tropical cyclones (45%) and 
climatic extremes such as droughts, SLR variations and heat waves 
(Sippo et al. 2018) (high conﬁdence). In Australia, the mangrove 
loss due to heat waves accounted for 22% of global mangrove 
forests (Sippo et  al. 2018), with negative impacts on ecosystem 
biodiversity and the provisioning of services (Carugati et al. 2018; 
Saintilan et al. 2018) (Section 5.4). In coastal areas with sufﬁcient 
sediment supply across the Indo-Paciﬁc region, inland expansion 
of mangroves is occurring as a result of vertical accretion and root 
growth, allowing them to keep pace with current SLR (Lovelock 
et al. 2015). In seagrass meadows, temperature is the main limiting 
range factor, and over the past decades there have been several 
global die-off events (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). The vulnerability 
of seagrasses to warming varies locally depending on soil accretion 
and herbivory (El-Hacen et  al. 2018; Marbà et  al. 2018; Vergés 
et al. 2018) and on the population assemblages (e.g., expansion 
at high latitudes) (Beca-Carretero et al. 2018; Duarte et al. 2018). 
The compounding effects of heat waves, hypersaline conditions 
and increased turbidity and nutrient levels associated with ﬂoods 
have been shown to cause negative changes in the composition 
and biomass of co-occurring seagrass species (Nowicki et  al. 
2017; Arias-Ortiz et  al. 2018; Lin  et  al. 2018) (high conﬁdence). 
For example, in Shark Bay, Western Australia, a marine heat wave 
in austral summer 2010/2011 caused widespread losses (36% of 
area) of seagrass meadows, with negative implications for carbon 
storage (Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018). The poleward expansion of tropical 
mangroves into subtropical salt marshes as a result of increase in 
temperature has been also observed over the past half century on 
ﬁve continents (Saintilan et al. 2014; Saintilan et al. 2018) (high 
conﬁdence); for example, in the Texas Gulf Coast (Armitage et al. 
2015). The loss of open areas with herbaceous plants (salt marshes) 
reduces food and habitat availability for resident and migratory 
animals (Kelleway et al. 2017a; Lin et al. 2018) (Section 5.4.1.2). 
The ability of salt marshes to increase their elevation and withstand 
erosion under SLR depends on the development of new soil by 
the external supply of mineral sediments and organic accretion 
by local biota (Section 5.4.1, Figure 5.19) (Bouma et al. 2016). In 
some places, critical organic accretion rates are declining due to 
reduced plant productivity from stress by more frequent inundation, 
and increased plant and microbial respiration rates as a result of 
warming; consequently, the elevation of marshes from soil accretion 
is slower than the rate of rising sea level, resulting in reduction of 
salt marsh area (Carey et al. 2017; Watson et al. 2017b). Vegetation 
loss rates were signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with marsh 
elevation, suggesting inundation due to SLR since 1970 as the 
main driver, enhanced by storms and increased tidal range in back 
barrier marshes (Watson et al. 2017b). Plant species that are more 
sensitive to higher temperatures and increases in saltwater intrusion 
were found to be less abundant and in some cases replaced by 
salinity-tolerant species (Janousek et al. 2017; Piovan et al. 2019). 
Plant community restructuring has resulted in biodiversity loss 
(Pratolongo et al. 2013; Raposa et al. 2017) and reduced above- and 
below-ground productivity (McLeod et al. 2011; Watson et al. 2017b). 
As a result of tidal ﬂooding, salt marsh soils do not dry out and high 
levels of carbon can accumulate under anaerobic conditions. This 
is coupled with generally low rates of methane emission which is 
strongly limited in saline marshes (Poffenbarger et al. 2011; Martin 
and Moseman-Valtierra, 2015; Kroeger et al. 2017; Tong et al. 2018) 
(high conﬁdence).
Non-climatic human pressures on wetland ecosystems, including 
overﬁshing (Crotty et  al. 2017), eutrophication (Legault II et  al. 
2018), and invasive species (Zhang et al. 2016), interact with climate 
change drivers and affect wetlands composition and structure, with 
the impacts varying between regions and species (Tomas et al. 2015; 
O’Brien et al. 2017; Pagès et al. 2017; York et al. 2017). The intensity of 
herbivory on seagrasses is expected to increase with global warming, 
particularly in temperate areas, because of the migration of tropical 
herbivores into temperate seagrass meadows (Hyndes et al. 2016; 
Vergés et al. 2018) (medium conﬁdence, Section 5.2.3.1.1). Warming 
also reduces the ﬁtness of seedlings by increasing necrosis and 
susceptibility to consumers and pathogenic pressure while reducing 
establishment potential and nutritional (Olsen et al. 2016b; Hernán 
et al. 2017). Because herbivores play a key role in modulating the 
biomass of plant communities, their more intense activity affects 
the provision of services in these ecosystems (Scott et  al. 2018) 
(Section 5.4). 
Globally, between 20−90% of existing coastal wetland area is 
projected to be lost by 2100 (Blankespoor et al. 2014; Crosby et al. 
2016; Spencer et al. 2016), depending on different SLR projections 
under future emission scenarios. These projected changes vary 
regionally and between different types of wetlands. Gaining area 
may be possible, at least locally, if vertical sediment accretion 
occurs together with lateral re-accommodation (Brown et  al. 
2018b; Schuerch et al. 2018) (Section 4.3.3.5.1). Local losses may 
also be higher; for example, in New England, where regional rates 
of SLR have been as much as 50% greater than the global average 
(from 1−5.83 mm yr–1; 1979–2015) (Watson et al. 2017a) and where 
projections suggest that 40–95% of salt marshes will be submerged 
by the end of this century (Valiela et al. 2018). In some species of 
seagrasses, enhanced temperature-driven ﬂowering (Ruiz-Frau 
et al. 2017) and greater biomass production in response to elevated 
CO2 (Campbell and Fourqurean, 2018) may increase resilience to 
warming. Nevertheless, severe habitat loss (70%) of endemic species 
such as Posidonia oceanica is projected by 2050 with the potential 
for functional extinction by 2100 under RCP8.5 climate scenario. For 
Cymodosea nodosa, the species with the highest thermal optima 
(Savva et  al. 2018), warming is expected to lead to signiﬁcant 
reduction of meadows (46% under RCP8.5) in the Mediterranean, 
although potentially compensated in part by future expansion into 
the Atlantic (Chefaoui et al. 2018).

The mangrove habitats of small islands, with lack of rivers, steep 
topography, sediment-starved areas, groundwater extraction and 
coastal development, are particularly vulnerable to SLR. Although 
mangrove ecosystems may survive the increased storm intensity and 
sea levels projected until 2100 under RCP2.6 (Ward et al. 2016), for 
RCP8.5 they are only resilient up to 2050 conditions (Sasmito et al. 
2016). Negative climate impacts will be exacerbated in cases where 
anthropogenic barriers cause further ‘coastal squeeze’ that prevents 
inland movement of plants and limits relocation of sediment (medium 
conﬁdence) (Enwright et al. 2016; Borchert et al. 2018).
In conclusion, substantial evidence supports with high conﬁdence 
that warming and salinisation of wetlands caused by SLR are causing 
shifts in the distribution of plant species inland and poleward, such 
as mangrove encroachment into subtropical salt marshes (high 
conﬁdence) or seagrass meadows contraction at low latitudes 
(high conﬁdence). Plants with low tolerance to ﬂooding and extreme 
temperatures are particularly vulnerable and may be locally extirpated 
(medium conﬁdence). The ﬂooded area of salt marshes can become 
a mudﬂat or be colonised by more tolerant, invasive species, whose 
expansion is favoured by combined effects of warming, rising CO2 
and nutrient enrichment (medium conﬁdence). The loss of vegetated 
coastal ecosystems causes a reduction in carbon storage with positive 
feedbacks to the climate system (high conﬁdence) (Section 5.4.1.2). 
SLR and warming are expected to continue to reduce the area of 
coastal wetlands, with a projected global loss of 20–90% by the end 
of the century depending on emission scenarios. High risk of total 
local loss is projected under the RCP8.5 emission scenario by 2100 
(medium conﬁdence), especially if landward migration and sediment 
supply is constrained by human modiﬁcation of shorelines and river 
ﬂows (medium conﬁdence).
5.3.3 
Sandy Beaches 
Sandy beaches represent 31% of the world’s ice-free shoreline 
(Luijendijk et  al. 2018). They provide habitat for dune vegetation, 
benthic fauna and sea birds, nesting areas for marine turtles (Defeo 
et al. 2009), and several key ecosystem services (Drius et al. 2019) 
(Section 5.4.1.2). Sandy beach ecosystems are physically dynamic, 
where sediment movement is a key driver of benthic ﬂora and fauna 
zonation (Schlacher and Thompson, 2013; van Puijenbroek et  al. 
2017). In AR5 WGII (Wong et al. 2014b) and SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg 
et al. 2018), climate impacts on sandy beach ecosystems were not 
assessed individually but together with other coastal systems that 
included beaches, barriers, sand dunes, rocky coasts, aquifers and 
lagoons. Those assessments concluded with high conﬁdence that 
SLR, storminess, wave energy and weathering regimes will continue 
to erode coastal shorelines and affect the soil accretion and land-
based ecosystems, with highly site-speciﬁc effects (high conﬁdence). 
Infrastructure and geological constraints reduce shoreline movement 
and cause coastal squeeze (high conﬁdence). Assessment in 
Section 4.3.3.3 supports the conclusions in AR5 and SR15 regarding 
the erosion of sandy coastlines. This section speciﬁcally assesses 
the combined climate and non-climatic impacts on sandy beach 
biodiversity, ecosystem structure and functioning.
Worldwide, sandy beaches show vegetation transformations caused 
by erosion following locally severe wave events (Castelle et al. 2017; 
Delgado-Fernandez et al. 2019; Zinnert et al. 2019) (Table SM5.7). The 
original dense vegetation is replaced by sparser vegetation (Zinnert 
et  al. 2019) and has a generally slow recovery (multiple years to 
decades) (Castelle et al. 2017). In some instances, the changes persist 
over decades, resulting in a regime shift in the beach morphology 
(Kuriyama and Yanagishima, 2018). Such changes in vegetation and 
beach morphology in response to local disturbances were also related 
to shifts in the associated fauna composition (Carcedo et al. 2017; 
Delgado-Fernandez et al. 2019). Direct attribution of these observed 
events to climate change is not available despite early evidence (since 
the 1970s) and an emerging literature (Section 4.3.3.1, Table SM5.7).
Sandy beaches show similar patterns of biogeographical shifts 
following warming, with increased dominance of species more 
tolerant to higher temperatures, as observed in other ocean 
ecosystems (Section 5.2.3.1.1, Table SM5.7). Examples of these 
observed shifts in abundance and distribution of benthic fauna in 
sandy beaches are found in the Paciﬁc and Atlantic coasts of North 
and South America, and in Australia, including increased mortality 
of clam populations close to their upper temperature limits with low 
population recovery (Orlando et al. 2019), and poleward expansion 
of crabs since the 1980s that were related to warming (Schoeman 
et al. 2015) (Table SM5.7). Also, mass mortalities of beach clams have 
occurred during warm phases of El Niño events (Orlando et al. 2019) 
(Table SM5.7), parasite infestations on dense populations (Vázquez 
et al. 2016) and high wave exposure (Turra et al. 2016).
Human disturbances have caused coastal squeeze and morphological 
changes in sandy beaches (Martínez et al. 2017; Rêgo et al. 2018; 
Delgado-Fernandez et al. 2019). Along with SLR and climate-driven 
intensiﬁcation of waves and offshore winds, these hazards have 
increased erosion rates suggesting a reduced resilience due to 
insufﬁcient sediment supply and accretion capacity (Castelle et al. 
2017; Houser et al. 2018; Kuriyama and Yanagishima, 2018). Narrow 
sandy beaches such as those in south California (Vitousek et al. 2017) 
or central Chile (Martínez et al. 2017) are particularly vulnerable to 
climate hazards when combined with human disturbances and 
where landward retreat of beach proﬁle and benthic organisms is 
constrained due to increasing urbanisation (Hubbard et  al. 2014) 
(Section 4.3.2.3).
Notwithstanding the uncertainty in projecting future interactions 
of SLR with other natural and human impacts on sandy shorelines 
(Le Cozannet et al. 2019; Orlando et al. 2019), they are expected 
to continue to reduce their area and change their topography due 
to SLR and increased extreme climatic erosive events. This will be 
especially important in low-lying coastal areas with high population 
and building densities (medium conﬁdence, SM 4.2). Megafauna 
that use sandy beaches during vulnerable parts of their life cycles 
could be particularly impacted (Laloë et al. 2017). For example, the 
modelled incubation temperatures of green turtles have increased 
by 1ºC since the mid-1970s, resulting in an average 20% increase in 
the proportion of female hatchlings over this period (Patrício et al. 
2019). By 2100, global temperatures will approach lethal levels for 
incubation in existing nesting sites, and hatchling success is expected 
497
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5
5
to drop to 32% under RCP8.5 scenario, with 93% of the hatchlings 
expected to be female (76% under RCP4.5). A possible microhabitat 
adaptation such as shadowed vegetated areas, however, could allow 
for continued male production throughout the 21st century (Patrício 
et  al. 2019). In addition, a projected global mean SLR of ~1.2 m 
under the upper likely range of RCP8.5 by 2100 implies a loss of 
59% and 67% in the present nesting area of the green turtle and 
the loggerhead respectively in the Mediterranean (Varela et  al. 
2019), and a loss of 43% in the nesting area of green turtles in West 
Africa (Patrício et al. 2019). Moreover, benthic crustaceans of sandy 
beaches, including isopods, crabs and amphipods, generally follow 
the temperature-body size gradient in which body size decreases 
towards warmer lower-latitude regions (Jaramillo et  al. 2017). 
Assuming that the physiological underpinning of the relationship 
between body size and temperature can be applied to warming (see 
Section 5.2.2, medium conﬁdence), the body size of sandy beach 
crustaceans is expected to decrease under warming (low evidence, 
medium agreement).
Overall, changes in sandy beach morphology have been observed 
from climate related events, such as storm surges, intensiﬁed offshore 
winds, and from coastal degradation caused by humans (high 
conﬁdence), with impacts on beach habitats (e.g., benthic megafauna) 
(medium conﬁdence). The direct inﬂuence of contemporary SLR on 
shoreline behaviour is emerging, but attribution of such changes to 
SLR remains difﬁcult (Section 4.3.3.1). Projected changes in mean 
and extreme sea levels (Section 4.2.3) and warming (Section 5.2.1) 
under RCP8.5 are expected to result in high risk of impacts on sandy 
beach ecosystems by the end of the 21st century (medium conﬁdence, 
Figure 5.16), taking account of the slow recovery rate of sandy beach 
vegetation, the direct loss of habitats and the high climatic sensitivity 
of some fauna. Under RCP2.6, the risk of impacts on sandy beaches 
is expected to be only slightly higher than the present day level (low 
conﬁdence, Figure 5.16). However, pervasive coastal urbanisation 
lowers the buffering capacity and recovery potential of sandy beach 
ecosystems to impacts from SLR and warming and thus is expected to 
limit their resilience to climate change (high conﬁdence).
5.3.4 
Coral Reefs
Human activities and warming have already led to major impacts on 
shallow water tropical coral reefs caused by species replacement, 
bleaching and decreased coral cover while warming, ocean acidiﬁcation 
and climate hazards will put warm water corals at very high risk even 
if global warming can be limited to 1.5ºC above pre-industrial level 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; Kubicek et al. 2019; Sully et al. 2019). 
While providing new evidence to support these previous assessments 
(Kleypas, 2019), this assessment focuses on evaluating the variations 
in sensitivities and responses of coral reefs and their associated biota 
to highlight comparative risks and resiliences. 
New evidence since AR5 and SR15 conﬁrms the impacts of ocean 
warming (Kao et al. 2018; Jury and Toonen, 2019) and acidiﬁcation 
(Jiang et al. 2018; Mollica et al. 2018; Bove et al. 2019) on coral 
reefs (high conﬁdence), enhancing reef dissolution and bioerosion 
(high conﬁdence), affecting coral species distribution, and leading 
to community changes (Agostini et al. 2018) (high conﬁdence). The 
rate of SLR (primarily noticed in small reef islands) may outpace the 
growth of reefs to keep up although there is low agreement in the 
literature (Brown et al. 2011; Perry et al. 2018) (low conﬁdence). Reefs 
are further exposed to other increased impacts, such as enhanced 
storm intensity (Lavender et al. 2018), turbidity and increased runoff 
from the land (Kleypas, 2019) (high conﬁdence). Recovery of coral 
reefs resulting from repeated disturbance events is slow (Hughes 
et al. 2019a; Ingeman et al. 2019) (high conﬁdence). Only few coral 
reef areas show some resilience to global change drivers (Fine et al. 
2019) (low conﬁdence). 
Globally, coral reefs and their associated communities are projected 
to change their species composition and biodiversity as a result of 
future interactions of multiple climatic and non-climatic hazards 
(Kleypas, 2019; Kubicek et al. 2019; Rinkevich, 2019) (high evidence, 
very high agreement, very high conﬁdence). Multiple stressors 
act together to increase the risk of population declines or local 
extinction of reef-associated species through impacts of warming 
and ocean acidiﬁcation on physiology and behaviours (Gunderson 
et al. 2017) (high conﬁdence). Alteration of composition of coral reef-
associated biota is exacerbated by changes in habitat conditions 
through increased sedimentation and nutrient concentrations from 
human coastal activities (Fabricius, 2005) (high conﬁdence). Coral 
ecosystems in tropical small islands are also at high risk of being 
affected by extreme events, including storms, with their impacts 
exacerbated by SLR (Duvat et al. 2017; Harborne et al. 2017) (high 
conﬁdence). Such risks on coral reef associated communities 
are substantially elevated when the level of these climatic and 
non-climatic hazards are above thresholds that may cause phase 
shifts in reef communities (McCook, 1999; Hughes et  al. 2010; 
Graham et al. 2013; Hughes et al. 2018) (high conﬁdence). A phase 
shift is characterised by an abrupt decrease in coral abundance 
or cover, with concurrent increase in the dominance of non-reef 
building organisms, such as algae and soft corals (Kleypas, 2019). 
Such phase shifts have already been observed in many coral reefs 
worldwide (Wernberg et al. 2016; Kleypas, 2019).
Notwithstanding the conclusion that coral reefs globally are projected 
to greatly decline at 2ºC warming relative to pre-industrial level 
(Cacciapaglia and van Woesik, 2018; Dietz et al. 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg 
et  al. 2018), climate impacts can be affected by variations in the 
sensitivity and adaptive capacity across coral species and coral reef 
ecosystems. Laboratory experiments show that some warm water 
corals possess the cellular, physiological or molecular machineries 
that could help them acclimatise or adapt to the effects of global 
change (medium conﬁdence) (DeBiasse and Kelly, 2016; Gibbin et al. 
2017; Wall et al. 2017; Camp et al. 2018; Donelson et al. 2018; Drake 
et al. 2018; Veilleux and Donelson, 2018; Hughes et al. 2019b). For 
example, there are species or genotypes that show less impacts by 
either ocean acidiﬁcation or increased temperatures (Cornwall et al. 
2018; Gintert et al. 2018). Some corals and their symbionts might 
be able to use epigenetic (heritable phenotype changes that do not 
involve alterations in the DNA sequences) mechanisms to reduce 
their sensitivity to temperature changes in their environment and to 
pass such traits to their offspring (Liew et al. 2017; Torda et al. 2017; 
Li et al. 2018b; Liew et al. 2018). The variations in sensitivity and 
498

adaptive capacity of coral species to warming and ocean acidiﬁcation 
contribute to changes in species composition of coral reefs as they 
are exposed to climatic and non-climatic hazards (Ingeman et  al. 
2019; Kleypas, 2019; Kubicek et al. 2019) (high conﬁdence). However, 
it has not yet been established whether coral and coral associated 
biota adaptation may hold beyond 1.5ºC warming. The onset of coral 
bleaching in the last decade has occurred at higher SSTs (~0.5ºC) 
than in the previous decade, suggesting that coral populations that 
remain after preceding bleaching events may have a higher thermal 
threshold (Sully et  al. 2019) (medium conﬁdence), potentially as 
a result of the increased dominance of species with lower sensitivity 
or higher adaptive capacity (Schulz et al. 2013; McClanahan et al. 
2014; Mumby and van Woesik, 2014; Pandolﬁ, 2015; Folkersen, 2018) 
(medium conﬁdence). 
Coral reefs in deeper or mesophotic waters (found in tropical/
subtropical regions at 30–150 m depth) may serve as refuges and 
sources for larval supply to those reefs exposed to disturbances 
(e.g.,  bleaching, storms, ﬂoods from land, sedimentation and 
tourism impacts) (Bridge et al. 2013; Thomas et al. 2015; Lindﬁeld 
et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2016b; Bongaerts et al. 2017). Reefs exposed 
to local oceanographic characteristics that reduce warming, such 
as upwelling, may similarly provide refuges and larval sources 
(Tkachenko and Soong, 2017). However, recent evidence suggests 
that mesophotic coral reefs are at higher risk than previously 
indicated (Rocha et al. 2018). Monitoring of coral reefs worldwide 
shows that some areas in the eastern tropical Paciﬁc Ocean (Smith 
et al. 2017), the Caribbean (Chollett and Mumby, 2013), the Red 
Sea (Fine et al. 2013; Osman et al. 2017), the Persian Gulf (Coles 
and Riegl, 2013) and the Great Barrier Reef, Australia (Hughes 
et al. 2010; Morgan et al. 2017) have recovered more rapidly after 
bleaching than the larger-scale average (medium conﬁdence). There 
are regional differences in reef vulnerability when considering scales 
larger than 100 km or over latitudinal gradients (van Hooidonk et al. 
2013; Heron et  al. 2016; Langlais et  al. 2017; McClenachan 
et al. 2017) (high conﬁdence).
Based on ﬁndings from simulation modelling, SR15 concluded that 
“coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5ºC 
(very high conﬁdence) with larger losses (>99%) at 2ºC (very high 
conﬁdence)”. The variations in exposure, sensitivity and adaptive 
capacity between coral populations and regions are further projected 
to cause large changes in the composition and structure of the 
remaining coral reefs, with large regional differences (van Hooidonk 
et al. 2016; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; Kleypas, 2019; Kubicek et al. 
2019; Sully et al. 2019). 
5.3.5 
Rocky Shores
Rocky shore ecosystems span the intertidal and shallow subtidal 
zones of the world’s temperate coasts and are typically dominated 
by calcareous mussels or seaweeds (macroalgae). Other organisms 
that inhabit rocky shores are coralline algae (i.e.,  maerl beds), 
polychaetes, molluscs, bryozoans and sponges. Intertidal habitats are 
characterised by strong environmental gradients, and are exposed 
to marine and atmospheric climate regimes (Hawkins et al. 2016). 
IPCC AR5 (Wong et al. 2014a) concluded that rocky shores are among 
the better-understood coastal ecosystems in terms of potential 
impacts of climate variability and change. The high sensitivity of 
sessile organisms (e.g., barnacles, mussels) to extreme temperature 
events (e.g., mass mortality and drastic biodiversity loss of mussels 
beds), and to acidiﬁcation (widely observed in manipulative 
experiments) gives high conﬁdence that rocky shore species are at 
high risk of changes in distribution and abundance from these two 
drivers. SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 2018) concluded that rocky 
coasts are already experiencing large-scale changes, and critical 
thresholds are expected to be reached at warming of 1.5ºC and 
above (high conﬁdence).
More observational and empirical evidence since AR5 and SR15 
conﬁrms that climate change poses high risk to rocky shore 
ecosystems’ biodiversity, structure and functioning through warming, 
acidiﬁcation, SLR and extreme events (Agostini et al. 2018; Duarte and 
Krause-Jensen, 2018; Ullah et al. 2018; Milazzo et al. 2019). Immobile 
intertidal organisms are especially vulnerable to warming, due to 
the potential for extreme heat exposure during low tide emersion 
and prolonged desiccation events (Hawkins et  al. 2016; Zamir 
et al. 2018) (high conﬁdence). This effect is expected to lower the 
upper vertical limit of intertidal communities (Hawkins et al. 2016), 
reducing their suitable habitat (Harley, 2011), and accompanied by 
temperature-induced increases in predation by consumers (Sanford, 
1999). While previous studies have documented a poleward shift in 
species distributions of rocky intertidal and reef algae (Duarte et al. 
2013; Nicastro et  al. 2013) and faunal species (Barry et  al. 1995; 
Mieszkowska et al. 2006; Lima et al. 2007), local extinctions at the 
equatorial or warm edge of species ranges are increasingly being 
attributed to climate change (Yeruham et al. 2015; Sorte et al. 2017) 
(high conﬁdence). Extreme heat waves are expected to cause mortality 
among rocky shore species (Gazeau et al. 2014; Jurgens et al. 2015) 
and subsequent declines or losses in important species can have 
cascading effects on the whole intertidal community and the services 
it provides (Gatti et al. 2017; Sorte et al. 2017; Sunday et al. 2017). 
Coralline fauna adapted to narrow environmental conditions seem 
especially vulnerable to heat waves, with observed mass mortalities in 
the Adriatic Sea in response to extreme summer temperatures (Kružić 
et al. 2016). The loss of thermal refugia associated with continued 
warming could exacerbate the impacts of heat stress on rocky 
intertidal communities (Lima et al. 2016). Nevertheless, experimental 
data indicate that some coralline algae that are well adapted to highly 
variable transitional environments can tolerate the warming projected 
for 2100 under RCP8.5; for these species, ocean acidiﬁcation will 
constitute the main hazard (Nannini et al. 2015). 
Ocean acidiﬁcation is expected to decrease the net calciﬁcation 
(high conﬁdence) and abundance (medium conﬁdence) of rocky 
intertidal and reef-associated species (Kroeker et al. 2013), and the 
dissolution of calcareous species has already been documented 
in tide-pool communities (Kwiatkowski et  al. 2016; Duarte and 
Krause-Jensen, 2018). Recent experimental and ﬁeld studies, 
however, have demonstrated the importance of food resources in 
mediating the effects of ocean acidiﬁcation on vulnerable rocky 
shores species (Ciais et al. 2013; Ramajo et al. 2016), suggesting 
that species’ vulnerability to ocean acidiﬁcation may be most 
499

pronounced in areas of high heat stress and low food availability 
(medium conﬁdence) (Kroeker et  al. 2017). There is increasing 
evidence that the interactions between multiple climate drivers 
will determine species vulnerability and the ecosystem impacts of 
climate change (Hewitt et al. 2016).
Studies on naturally acidiﬁed rocky reef ecosystems suggest 
ocean acidiﬁcation will simplify rocky shore ecosystems, due to 
an overgrowth by macroalgae, a reduction in biodiversity and 
a reduction in the abundance of calcareous species (medium 
conﬁdence) (Kroeker et al. 2013; Linares et al. 2015). These shifts in 
community structure and function have been observed in CO2 seep 
communities (Hall-Spencer et al. 2008), already exposed to levels of 
pCO2 expected to generally occur by the end of the century (Agostini 
et al. 2018). Reductions in the abundance of calcareous herbivores 
that can create space for rarer species by grazing the dominant algae, 
are expected to contribute to the overgrowth of ﬂeshy macroalgae 
on rocky shores (Baggini et al. 2015). This shift towards macroalgae 
is associated with a simpliﬁcation of the food web at lower trophic 
levels (Kroeker et al. 2011). 
At the local scale, warming and ocean acidiﬁcation are expected 
to change energy ﬂows within rocky shores ecosystems (medium 
conﬁdence). Experiments indicate that both climate drivers may boost 
primary productivity in some cases (Goldenberg et al. 2017); however, 
increased metabolic demands and greater consumption by predators 
under warmer temperature increase the strength of top-down control 
(predation mortalities of herbivores) and thus counteracts the effects 
of increased bottom-up productivity (Goldenberg et al. 2017; Kordas 
et al. 2017). Ocean acidiﬁcation could also increase species energetic 
costs and the grazing rate of herbivores, affecting ecosystem 
responses to increased primary productivity (Ghedini et  al. 2015). 
Although these increasingly complex experiments have highlighted 
the potential for species interactions to mediate the effects of climate 
change, our understanding of the effects on intact, functioning 
ecosystems is limited. Despite predictions for increased production 
and herbivory with warming and acidiﬁcation, an experimental study 
of a more complex food web revealed an overall reduction in the 
energy ﬂow to higher trophic levels and a shift towards detritus-based 
food webs (Ullah et al. 2018).
Overall, intertidal rocky shores ecosystems are highly sensitive to 
ocean warming, acidiﬁcation and extreme heat exposure during 
low tide emersion (high conﬁdence). More ﬁeld and experimental 
evidence shows that these ecosystems are at a moderate risk at 
present and this level is expected to rise to very high under the 
RCP8.5 scenario by the end of the century (see Section 5.3.7). 
Benthic species will continue to relocate in the intertidal zones 
and experience mass mortality events due to warming (high 
conﬁdence). Interactive effects between acidiﬁcation and warming 
will exacerbate the negative impacts on rocky shore communities, 
causing a shift towards a less diverse ecosystem in terms of species 
richness and complexity, increasingly dominated by macroalgae 
(high conﬁdence).
5.3.6 
Kelp Forests
Kelp forests are three-dimensional, highly productive coastal 
ecosystems with a reported global NPP between 1.02–1.96 GtC yr–1 
(Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016). They cover about 25% of the 
world’s coastline (Filbee-Dexter et al. 2016), mostly temperate and 
polar (Steneck et  al. 2003). Canopy-forming macroalgae provide 
habitat for many associated invertebrates and ﬁsh communities 
(Pessarrodona et al. 2019). This assessment synthesises new evidence 
since SR15 on climate risks and impacts, and their interactions 
with non-climatic drivers on ecosystem biodiversity, structure 
and functioning.
Observational and experimental evidence since SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg 
et  al. 2018) supports its conclusions that kelp forests are already 
experiencing large-scale changes, and that critical thresholds occur for 
some forests at 1.5ºC of global warming (high conﬁdence). Due to their 
low capacity to relocate and high sensitivity to warming, kelp forests 
are projected to experience higher frequency of mass mortality events 
as the exposure to extreme temperature rises (very high conﬁdence). 
Moreover, changes in ocean currents have facilitated the entry of 
tropical herbivorous ﬁsh into temperate kelp forests decreasing their 
distribution and abundance (medium conﬁdence). More evidence from 
model projections in the 21st century supports this observed range 
contraction of kelp forests at the warm end of their distributional 
margins and expansion at the poleward end with the rate being faster 
for high emission scenarios (high conﬁdence).
New global estimates show that the abundance of kelp forests 
has decreased at a rate of ~2% per year over the past half century 
(Wernberg et al. 2019), mainly due to ocean warming and marine 
heat waves (e.g., in western Australia a mean loss of 43% in area 
followed a marine heat weave in summer 2010–2011 (Wernberg et al. 
2016), Section 6.4.2.1), as well as from other human stressors (high 
conﬁdence) (Filbee-Dexter and Wernberg, 2018). At some localities, 
human-driven environmental changes such as coastal eutrophication 
and pollution is causing severe deterioration of kelp forests adding to 
the loss of these ecosystems from warming, storms and heat weaves 
(Andersen et al. 2013; Filbee-Dexter and Wernberg, 2018). 
Two global datasets and one dataset covering European coastlines 
(Araujo et al. 2016; Krumhans et al. 2016; Poloczanska et al. 2016) 
identify large local and regional variations in kelp abundance over 
the past half century with 38% of these ecoregions showing a 
decline, 27% an increase and 35% no change (Krumhans et  al. 
2016). These data reﬂect the high spatio-temporal variability and 
resilience of kelp forests (Reed et al. 2016; Wernberg et al. 2018). 
For example, a 34 year dataset of kelp canopy biomass along the 
California coastline does not yet show a signiﬁcant response to global 
warming because this ecosystem responds to low frequency marine 
climate oscillations (Bell et al. 2018c). However, between 1950–2010 
regional warming caused consistent negative responses in 
abundance, phenology, demography and calciﬁcation of macroalgae 
for the northeast Atlantic and southeast Indian Ocean (Poloczanska 
et al. 2016). Declines in kelp forest abundance attributed to climate 
change and not related to sea urchin overgrazing (which is a major 
driver of decline and regime shift; Ling et  al. (2014)) have been 
500

documented since the 1970s and evidence has increased within the 
last two decades (Filbee-Dexter and Wernberg, 2018). Despite a lack 
of data from some regions such as South America (Pérez-Matus 
et al. 2017), observational evidence since SR15 supports with very 
high conﬁdence that warming is driving a contraction of kelp forests 
at low latitudes (Franco et al. 2018b; Casado-Amezúa et al. 2019; 
Pessarrodona et al. 2019) and expansion in polar regions (medium 
conﬁdence) (Section 3.2.3.1.2) (Bartsch et al. 2016; Paar et al. 2016). 
In many areas worldwide where the distribution range of kelp has 
contracted due to climatic and non-climatic drivers, it has been 
replaced by a less diverse and less complex turf-dominated ecosystem 
(Filbee-Dexter and Wernberg, 2018) (high conﬁdence). Kelp supports 
other ecosystem components by providing food, substrate for 
spawning and habitat that mediate trophic interactions (O’Brien et al. 
2018); its degradation therefore reduces species richness, biomass 
production and dependent ﬂora and fauna species (Teagle and Smale, 
2018; Pessarrodona et al. 2019). In the northeast Atlantic, the warm 
water species Laminaria ochroleuca is expanding poleward into 
regions previously dominated by the cold water species L. hyperborea 
which is retreating at its southern edge. These two kelp species are 
similar in morphology, but the cold water L. hyperborea hosts sessile 
communities of algae and invertebrates 12 times more diverse and 
richer in biomass than the warm water kelp species (Teagle and Smale, 
2018). Climate-driven shifts in the species composition also affect 
carbon cycling, because warm-temperate kelps produce larger pools 
of organic matter than cold-temperate species, and their detritus is 
degraded faster (Pessarrodona et al. 2019).
New empirical eco-physiological studies in combination with ﬁeld 
surveys support the evidence for climate change causing kelp 
forest degradation and range shifts (Franco et al. 2018b; Wernberg 
et al. 2018). For example, interactive effects of ocean warming and 
acidiﬁcation cause kelp degradation and disease-like symptoms, 
with detrimental effects on photosynthetic efﬁciency (Qiu et  al. 
2019). Enhanced herbivory due to warming and the establishment of 
herbivorous ﬁsh species in temperate kelp forest has been observed 
to enhance ecosystem degradation (Vergés et  al. 2016). However, 
invader seaweed species driven by warming can create more complex 
trophic interactions, reducing the consumption by herbivorous 
gastropods (Miranda et al. 2019). Increased physical stress by storm 
events also alters the kelps community, affecting the recruitment 
time of kelp species. The resulting dominance of younger stages 
favors species with a year-round spore production or an opportunistic 
life strategy, reducing the kelp canopy (Pereira et al. 2017).
Projections of future distribution of kelp species based on their 
physiological thresholds show major species-speciﬁc range shifts 
under different emission scenarios. For example, under RCP2.6, 
laminaria and other canopy-forming seaweed species in the 
Northwest Atlantic are projected to show northward range shifts 
at their southern (warm) edge of ≤40 km, with some equatorial 
range expansion from 2050 to 2100. That northward range shift 
increases to 406 km under RCP8.5 (at 13–19 km per decade, 
including contractions of their warmer edges) (Wilson et al. 2019). 
Whilst no changes in species richness are projected under RCP2.6, 
more than 50% richness loss is projected under RCP8.5 in some 
areas (Wilson  et  al. 2019). Overall, model projections show that 
worldwide range contractions of kelps can be expected to continue 
at the warm end of distributional margins and range expansions at 
their poleward end (high conﬁdence) (Raybaud et  al. 2013; Assis 
et al. 2016; Assis et al. 2018; Wilson et al. 2019).
In summary, kelp forests have experienced large-scale habitat loss 
and degradation of ecosystem structure and functioning over the 
past half century, implying a moderate to high level of risk at present 
conditions of global warming (high conﬁdence) (Section 5.3.7). The 
loss of kelp forests is followed by the colonisation of turfs, which 
contributes to the reduction in habitat complexity, carbon storage 
and diversity (high conﬁdence). Kelp ecosystems are expected to 
continue to decline in temperate regions driven by ocean warming 
and intensiﬁcation of extreme climate events (high conﬁdence). The 
level of risk for the ecosystem is projected to rise to very high under 
RCP8.5 scenario by 2100 (high conﬁdence). 
5.3.7 
Risk Assessment for Coastal Ecosystems 
This section synthesises the assessment of climate impacts on coastal 
ecosystems’ biodiversity, structure and functioning and the levels 
of risk under contrasting future conditions of global warming. As 
described in Section 5.2.5, the format for Figure 5.16 matches that of 
Figure 19.4 of AR5 (Oppenheimer et al. 2015) and Figure 3.20 of SR15 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), indicating the levels of additional risk 
as colours (white, yellow, red and purple). The elements or burning 
embers for coastal ecosystems (Figure  5.16) indicate how risks 
increase with ocean warming, acidiﬁcation, deoxygenation, SLR and 
extreme events with a comparison between present day conditions 
(2000s) and future conditions by the year 2100 under low (RCP2.6) 
and high (RCP8.5) CO2 emission scenarios. The transition between the 
levels of risk for each type of coastal ecosystem is estimated from key 
evidence assessed in Sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.6. The embers are based on 
SST  and the transition-values may have an error of ±0.3ºC depending 
on the consensus of expert judgment. The assessed conﬁdence in 
assigning the levels of risk at present day and future scenarios are 
low, medium, high and very high levels of conﬁdence. A  detailed 
account of the procedures involved in developing the ember for each 
type of coastal ecosystem is given in the supplementary material 
(SM5.3). This includes the description of climate hazards, sensitivity 
of key biotic and abiotic components, natural adaptive capacity, and 
observed impacts and projected risks. The burning embers for seagrass 
meadows, warm water corals and mangrove forests are in agreement 
with the conclusions in SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). The more 
recent literature assessed here strengthens the overall conﬁdence in 
the assignment of transition and the level of risk for each ecosystem. 
Detection and attribution studies show that climate change impacts 
began over the past 50 years in coastal ecosystems, indicating 
a transition from undetectable risk (white areas in Figure 5.16) 
to moderate risk below recent sea surface temperatures for some 
ecosystems (high conﬁdence). This transition occurs at lower 
global levels of sea surface warming for coral reefs (0.2ºC–0.4ºC) 
(high conﬁdence), seagrass meadows (0.5ºC–0.8ºC) (very high 
conﬁdence) and kelp forests (0.6ºC–1.0ºC) (high conﬁdence), 
501

with coral reefs already at high risk (0.4ºC–0.6ºC) for the present 
day (very high conﬁdence). Global common responses include 
large-scale coral bleaching events (Section 5.3.4) and contraction of 
seagrass meadows (Section 5.3.2) and kelp forests (Section 5.3.6) at 
low-latitudes (high conﬁdence), in response to warming and marine 
heat waves. Degraded coral reefs and kelp forests have shifted to 
algal and turf-dominated ecosystem at several regions worldwide, 
causing loss of habitat complexity and biodiversity.
The transition from undetectable to moderate risk in salt marshes 
(Section 5.3.2) and rocky shores (Section 5.3.5) takes place between 
0.7ºC–1.2ºC of global sea surface warming (medium/high conﬁdence), 
and between 0.9ºC–1.8ºC (medium conﬁdence) in sandy beaches 
(Section 5.3.3), estuaries (Section 5.3.1) and mangrove forests 
(Section 5.3.2) (Figure 5.16). In all these coastal ecosystems, the detection 
and attribution of changes in biodiversity, structure and functioning 
are not as robust as in coral, seagrass and kelp ecosystems that have 
been extensively studied over the past decades and are highly sensitive 
to extreme climate events. Estuaries and sandy beaches are highly 
dynamic in terms of hydrological and geomorphological processes, 
giving them more natural adaptive capacity to climate impacts. In 
these systems, sediment relocation, soil accretion and landward 
expansion of vegetation may mitigate against ﬂooding and habitat 
loss in the context of SLR and extreme climate-driven erosion. Common 
global responses observed since 1970 include poleward expansion of 
mangrove forests due to warming; transformation of salt marshes into 
mudﬂats; shifts in species composition in response to ﬂooding and 
salinisation; upstream migration of estuarine biota; and redistribution 
of macrobenthic communities in sandy beaches. Calciﬁed organisms 
in intertidal rocky shores are highly sensitive to ocean warming and 
acidiﬁcation, marine heat waves and heat exposure during low tide, 
with observed mass mortality events and reduced calciﬁcation.

Multiple climatic hazards are considered, including ocean warming, deoxygenation, acidiﬁcation, changes in nutrients, particulate organic carbon ﬂux and sea level rise 
(SLR) (see sections 5.2 and 5.3). The projected changes in sea surface temperature (SST) from an ensemble of general circulation models (left panels) indicate the level of 
ocean changes under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (see Cross Chapter Box 1 Table CB1 for the projected global average changes in average air temperature, SST and other selected 
ocean variables). Global average impacts/risks are represented. Regional variations of risks/impacts are described in Section 5.2.5, 5.3.7, SM5.2 and SM5.5. Impact/risk 
levels do not consider human risk reduction strategies such as societal adaptation, or future changes in non-climatic hazards. The grey vertical bars indicate the transition 
between the levels of risks, with their conﬁdence level based on expert judgment. Note: The ﬁgure depicts climate change impacts and risks on warm water corals taken 
from SR15, based on global models. Observed impacts on coral reefs ecosystems outlined in Section 5.3.4 and Box 5.5 reveal a more complex situation that may result in 
regional differences in conﬁdence levels.

In all coastal ecosystems, multiple climate hazards will emerge from 
historical variability in the 21st century under RCP8.5 (Box 5.1), while 
the time of emergence will be later and with less climate hazard under 
RCP2.6. Non-climatic human impacts such as eutrophication add to, 
and in some cases, exacerbate these large-scale slow climate drivers 
beyond biological thresholds at local scale (e.g., deoxygenation). 
All coastal ecosystems will experience high to very high risk under 
RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century. The ecosystems expected 
to be at very high risk under the high emission scenario are coral 
reefs (transition from high to very high risk 0.6ºC–1.2ºC) (very high 
conﬁdence), seagrasses meadows (2.2ºC–3.0ºC) (high conﬁdence), 
kelp forests (2.2ºC–2.8ºC) (high conﬁdence) and rocky shores (2.9ºC–
3.4ºC) (medium conﬁdence). These ecosystems have low to moderate 
adaptive capacity, as they are highly sensitive to ocean warming, 
marine heat waves and acidiﬁcation. For example, kelp forests at low-
latitudes and temperate seagrass meadows with endemic species will 
continue to retreat with more frequent extreme temperatures, and their 
low dispersal ability will elevate the risk of local extinction. Biogenic 
shallow reefs with calciﬁed organisms (e.g., corals, mussels, calciﬁed 
algae) are particularly sensitive to ocean acidiﬁcation and compound 
effects with rising temperatures, deoxygenation, SLR and increasing 
extreme events, making these ecosystems highly vulnerable (with 
low resilience) to future emission scenarios. Furthermore, almost all 
coral reefs will greatly decline from their current levels, even if global 
warming remains below 2ºC (very high conﬁdence). Any coral reefs 
that do survive to the end of the century will not be the same because 
of irreversible changes in habitat structure and functioning, including 
species extinctions and food web disruptions; these changes are 
already taking place (e.g., the Caribbean reefs). The transition to new 
ecosystem states driven by unpredictable pulses of disturbance and 
progressive climate hazards will have negative impacts on ecosystem 
services (Section 5.4).
The ecosystems at moderate to high risk under future emission 
scenarios (Figure 5.16) are mangrove forests (transition from 
moderate to high risk at 2.5ºC–2.7ºC of global sea surface 
warming), estuaries and sandy beaches (2.3ºC–3.0ºC) and salt 
marshes (transition from moderate to high risk at 1.8ºC–2.7ºC and 
from high to very high risk at 3.0ºC–3.4ºC) (medium conﬁdence). 
Mangrove forests and salt marshes can initially cope with SLR by 
plant biomass accumulation, soil accretion and sediment relocation, 
but the evidence shows they are unlikely to withstand the SLR 
projected under RCP8.5. Moreover, pervasive coastal squeeze and 
human-driven habitat deterioration will reduce the natural capacity 
of these ecosystems to adapt to climate impacts (high conﬁdence). 
Projected warming and SLR by the end of the century will continue to 
expand salinisation and hypoxia in estuaries with high risk of impacts 
for benthic and pelagic biota. These impacts will be more pronounced 
under RCP8.5 in more vulnerable eutrophic, shallow and microtidal 
estuaries in temperate and high latitudes. Erosion in sandy beach 
ecosystems will continue with global warming, rising sea level and 
more intense and frequent storm surges and marine heat waves. The 
risk of losing habitats for ﬂora and fauna is expected to rise to high 
level under the high emission scenario by the end of the 21st century 
(medium conﬁdence, Figure 5.16). By contrast, the risk of impacts is 
expected to be only slightly higher than present for a low emission 
scenario than today (medium conﬁdence, Figure 5.16).
All types of ecosystems that have been assessed in the open ocean 
(Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4) and coastal areas (Sections 5.3.1 to 5.3.6) 
show increased risk under both the low and the high emission 
scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) compared with the present level of 
change (Figure 5.16). In all assessed cases with all of the factors 
considered (climate drivers and physiological understanding), RCP2.6 
has a lower level of risk than RCP8.5 (very high conﬁdence). 
5.4 
Changing Marine Ecosystem Services 
and Human Well-being
Ecosystem services are the environmental processes and functions 
that have monetary or intrinsic value to human society; they render 
beneﬁts to people and support human well-being (Tallis et al. 2010; 
Costanza et  al. 2014). Marine ecosystem services are generated 
throughout the ocean, from shallow water to the deep sea 
(Armstrong et al. 2012; Thurber et al. 2014). Although all ecosystem 
services are interconnected (Leadley et al. 2014), they can be broadly 
divided into provisioning services, regulating services, supporting 
services and cultural services (Sandifer and Sutton-Grier, 2014), as 
considered below (Section 5.4.1) together with their implications for 
human well-being (Section 5.4.2). Ecosystem services have also been 
described as ‘nature’s contribution to people’ (Díaz et al. 2018). 
5.4.1 
Changes in Key Ecosystem Services
AR5 WGII concluded that climate change increases the risk of 
impacts on the goods and services derived from marine biodiversity 
and ecosystems (Pörtner et al. 2014). SR15 concluded that current 
ecosystem services from the ocean are expected to be reduced at 
1.5ºC of global warming, with losses being even greater at 2ºC of 
global warming. These reductions in services are driven by decreasing 
ocean productivity, biogeographic shifts, damage to ecosystems, 
loss of ﬁsheries productivity and changes to ocean chemistry (high 
conﬁdence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). Building on these previous 
assessments, this section assesses new evidence on observed 
impacts and future risk of climate change on ecosystem goods and 
services from the open ocean (Section 5.2) and coastal ecosystems 
(Section 5.3). Chapter 3 assesses ecosystem services in polar oceans.
5.4.1.1 
Provisioning Services
Fisheries are an important provisioning service from marine 
ecosystems, providing food, nutrition, income and livelihoods for many 
millions of people around the world (FAO, 2018). Globally, total ﬁsh 
catches amount to 80–105 Mt annually in the 2000s (FAO, 2016; FAO 
2018; Pauly and Zeller, 2016), directly generating over 80 billion USD 
of revenue (Sumaila et al. 2015). Most global ﬁsheries are considered 
to be fully- to over-exploited (FAO, 2018). Over 80% of the global ﬁsh 
catch is estimated to be from coastal and shelf seas with less than 
20% from the high seas (Sumaila et al. 2015) (Figure 5.17).
503
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5

Observed ﬁsh catches have been related to NPP and water 
temperature, with the direction and magnitude of the relationship 
varying between regions and ﬁsh stocks (Cheung et al. 2008; McOwen 
et al. 2015; Britten et al. 2016; Stock et al. 2017). The maximum 
catch potential of large marine ecosystems generally increases with 
their NPP and energy transfer efﬁciency, but the relative importance 
of total NPP to ﬁsheries production is lower in nutrient-poor systems 
with microbially-dominated foodwebs (Section 5.2) and empirical 
relationships between NPP and ﬁsheries production over-estimate 
potential catches in polar regions (Stock et al. 2017) (Chapter 3). 
Here, potential ﬁsh catch or maximum catch potential refers to the 
potential of the ﬁsh stocks to provide long-term ﬁsh catches; it is 
considered a proxy of maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, 
the actual catches realised by ﬁsheries will depend strongly on 
past and present ﬁshing effort and the exploitation status of the 
resources (Cheung et al. 2018a; Barange, 2019). Observed variations 
between regions suggest that changes in temperature and NPP in the 
past (Section 5.2.2, 5.2.3) may have also affected maximum catch 
potential (medium evidence, high agreement, medium conﬁdence).
Changes in ﬁsh catches from 1998 to 2006 in 47 large marine 
ecosystems around the world were found to be signiﬁcantly related 
to: changes in estimated cholorophyll a (a proxy for phytoplankton 
biomass) in 18 of these ecosystems (mostly tropical and eastern 
boundary upwelling systems); changes in SST in 12 of these 
ecosystems (mostly mid-latitude); and changes in ﬁshing intensity 
in 16 of these ecosystems (widely spread) (McOwen et  al. 2015). 
Analysis of population data since the 1950s for 262 ﬁsh stocks across 
39 large marine ecosystems and the high seas suggest that average 
recruitment to the stocks has declined by around 3% of the historical 
maximum per decade with variations between regions and stocks 
(Britten et al. 2016). The declines (69% of the studied stocks, 31 of 
the 39 assessed large marine ecosystems) are signiﬁcantly related to 
estimated chlorophyll a concentration and the intensity of ﬁshing, 
with the North Atlantic showing the steepest declines (Britten et al. 
2016). In addition, recent meta-analysis of population data from 
235 ﬁsh stocks worldwide from 1930 to 2010 suggest that the 
maximum catch potential from these populations decreased by 4.1% 
(95% conﬁdence span 9.0% decline to 0.3% increase) during this 
period with variations between ﬁsh stocks and regions (Free et al. 
2019). Speciﬁcally, temperature is a signiﬁcant factor explaining 
changes in catch potential of 12% of the ﬁsh stocks, with East Asian 
regions having the largest stock declines related to warming. In 
intermediate latitudes across the Atlantic, Indian and Paciﬁc Oceans, 
catches of tropical tunas, including skipjack and yellowﬁn tuna, are 
signiﬁcantly and positively related to increases in SST, although the 
overall catches across latitudinal zones do not show signiﬁcant 
change (Monllor-Hurtado et al. 2017). Observational evidence from 
spatial and temporal linkages between catches and oceanographic 
variables therefore supports the conclusions from AR5 WGII and 
SR15 that potential ﬁsheries catches have already been impacted by 
the effects of warming and changing primary production on growth, 
reproduction and survival of ﬁsh stocks (robust evidence, high 
agreement, high conﬁdence).

There are substantial variations in the direction of changes and the 
attribution of climatic drivers between regions and ﬁsh stocks, and 
the availability of datasets is biased towards mid-latitude areas and 
epipelagic and coastal ecosystems. As a result, quantitative attribution 
of climate impacts on the productivity of speciﬁc ﬁsh stocks has low 
conﬁdence. Changes in catch potential for ﬁsh stocks and regions 
worldwide that were considered overﬁshed were most sensitive to 
warming (Essington et al. 2015; Britten et al. 2016; Free et al. 2019). 
This suggest that climatic drivers and overﬁshing have interacted 
synergistically in impacting some ﬁsh stocks and their catches (high 
conﬁdence). In addition, analysis of historical catch records since AR5 
show further warming related changes in species composition, with an 
increased dominance of warm water species in coastal and shelf seas 
since the 1970s (Cheung et al. 2013; Keskin and Pauly, 2014; Tsikliras 
et al. 2014; Maharaj et al. 2018). Many marine ecosystems worldwide 
have shown an increased dominance of warm water species following 
increases in sea water temperature (Section 5.2.3, 5.3), with parallel 
changes in the species composition of ﬁsh catches since the 1970s in 
many of the studied shelf seas (high conﬁdence).
Based on CMIP5 ESM projections of changes in temperature, net 
primary production, oxygen, salinity and sea ice extent, two marine 
ecosystem and ﬁsheries models project a decrease in maximum 
catch potential under RCP 2.6 of 3.9–8.5% by 2041–2060 and 
3.4–6.4% by 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 (based on model 
projections described in Barange et al. 2018). Under RCP 8.5, the 
projected decrease was larger: 8.6–14.2% and 20.5–24.1% by 
the mid- and end- of the 21st century (Figure 5.18). The trends 
agree with the projected changes in total marine animal biomass 
for the 21st century (Blanchard et  al. 2017; Lotze et  al. 2018) 
(Section 5.2.3). A single ﬁsheries model with atmospheric warming 
projected a potential catch loss of 3.4 million tonnes and decreases 
of 6.4% of catch potential of the exploited species per degree 
Celsius atmospheric warming relative to 1951–1960 level (Cheung 
et al. 2016b) (Figure 5.18). Interactions between temperature, net 
primary production and transfer efﬁciency of energy across the 
foodweb are projected to amplify these trends, with projected 
decreases greater than 50% in some regions by 2100 under high 
emissions scenarios (Stock et al. 2017). Thus, there is high model 
agreement that ocean warming and changes in NPP in the 21st 
century will reduce the global maximum catch potential, particularly 
in tropical oceans (high conﬁdence) and alter the distribution and 
composition of exploited species (high conﬁdence). The projected 
risk of these ﬁsheries impacts increases with increasing greenhouse 
gas emissions (high conﬁdence). However, given the uncertainties 
of projected changes in ocean conditions from ESMs (Section 5.2.2), 
and that most global scale ﬁsheries models are largely driven by 
changes in temperature and primary production while other changes 
in ocean biogeochemical changes are not explicitly considered 
(Tittensor et al. 2018), the quantitative magnitude of the projected 
changes in maximum catch potential is considered to have medium 
and low conﬁdence at global and regional scales, respectively. Given 
the signiﬁcant interactions between catch potential and level of 
ﬁsheries exploitation, the realised catches in the 21st century would 
depend on future scenarios of ﬁshing and ﬁsheries governance 
(Section 5.4.2, 5.5). As a result, projections of realised catches have 
low conﬁdence.
Tropical oceans are projected to experience much larger impacts (three 
times or more decrease in catch potential) than the global average, 
particularly the western central Paciﬁc Ocean, eastern central Atlantic 
Ocean and the western Indian Ocean, by the end of the 21st century 
under RCP8.5 (Blanchard et al. 2017). For example, around the exclusive 
economic zones of the Paciﬁc Islands states, more than 50% of exploited 
ﬁshes and invertebrates are projected to become locally extinct in many 
regions by 2100 relative to the recent past under RCP8.5 (Asch et al. 
2018). These factors cause 74% of the area to experience a projected 
loss in catch potential of more than 50%. Under RCP2.6, the area of 
large projected catch loss is projected to be halved (Asch et al. 2018). 
However, while temperate commercially-important tunas species 
such as albacore, Atlantic and southern blueﬁn) are projected to shift 
poleward and decrease in abundance in the tropics, some tropical 
species such as skipjack tuna are projected to remain abundant, but with 
changes in distribution patterns in low-latitude regions by the mid-21st 
century, with some models projecting subsequent decrease under 
RCP8.5 (Lehodey et al. 2013; Dueri et al. 2014; Erauskin-Extramiana 
et al. 2019). Recent evidence therefore supports the conclusion from 
previous assessments (Pörtner et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018) 
that low-latitude ﬁsh catch potential are projected to have a high risk 
of climate impacts, which will be exacerbated by higher greenhouse 
gas emissions (medium evidence, high agreement, high conﬁdence). 
Tropical ﬁsh catch potential of some species resilient to the changing 
environment may have lower climate risk in the near-term although 
their risk increases substantially further into the 21st century under 
RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). In contrast, the catch potential in the 
Arctic is projected to increase, although with high inter-model variability 
(medium evidence, low agreement, low conﬁdence) (Cheung and Pauly, 
2016; Blanchard et al. 2017) (Chapter 3). 
Although demersal ﬁsheries in the deep ocean represent a small 
proportion of global ﬁsheries catches, they are economically valuable 
for some countries, and there is increasing commercial interest in 
mesopelagic (deep pelagic ocean) ﬁsheries (St. John et  al. 2016). 
Commercially-exploited ﬁsh and shellﬁsh from deep sea ecosystems 
will be exposed to climate risks from physical and chemical changes 
in ocean conditions including warming, decreased oxygen, reduced 
aragonite saturation state, and decreased supply of particulate organic 
matter from the upper ocean (Section 5.2.3, 5.2.4) (FAO, 2019). 
These biogeochemical changes may reduce the growth, reproduction 
and survivorship of deep-ocean ﬁsh stocks, which will alter their 
distributions, in similar ways to those in the surface ocean, impacting 
their ﬁsh catch potential (FAO, 2019). For example, in the eastern 
Paciﬁc near-bottom oxygen concentration is positively correlated with 
biomass of commercially harvested species (Keller et al. 2010) and catch 
per unit effort (Banse, 1968; Rosenberg et al. 1983; Keller et al. 2015); 
some commercially harvested species only appear during oxygenation 
events associated with El Niño (Arntz et al. 2006). In the mesopelagic 
zone, expansion of the OMZ results in habitat compression that can 
increase catchability of ﬁsh stocks such as tunas (Prince et al. 2010; 
Stramma et al. 2011). Also, as OMZ expands, the potential may exist 
for increased availability and harvest of hypoxia-tolerant species such 
as Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.) 
or dover sole (Microstomus paciﬁcus) (Gilly et al. 2013; Gallo and Levin, 
2016). However, any expansion of the OMZ will interact with other 
climatic hazards such as warming, which then adds to the overall risk of 
506

Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

impacts on ﬁsh stocks and their catches (Breitburg et al. 2018). Overall, 
the abundance of ﬁsheries resources and potential catches from the 
deep sea will be at high risk of impacts in the 21st century under RCP8.5 
(low conﬁdence), with reduced risk under RCP2.6 (medium conﬁdence). 
In addition to capture ﬁsheries, mariculture (marine aquaculture) is also 
an important marine ecosystem provisioning service, contributing about 
27.7 million tonnes of seafood in 2016 (FAO, 2018). Recent projections 
of climate change impacts on mariculture, based on thermal tolerance 
and the effects of changing temperature, primary production and 
ocean acidiﬁcation, suggest an overall decline in mariculture potential 
by 2100 under RCP8.5 with large regional variations (Froehlich et al. 
2018). Modelling analyses for farmed Atlantic salmon, cobia and 
seabream also suggest that climate change would reduce their growth 
potential in ocean areas where temperature is projected to increase to 
levels outside the thermal tolerance ranges of these species (Klinger 
et  al. 2017). This decrease in growth could therefore translate into 
a decrease in the general productivity of the sector (limited evidence, 
low conﬁdence); however, new potential areas and the use of more 
climate resilient strains or species for mariculture may emerge that 
could reduce the risk of impacts on potential mariculture production 
(limited evidence, low conﬁdence).
Box 5.3 |  Responses of Coupled Human-Natural Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems 
to Climate Change
Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are among the world’s most productive ocean ecosystems (Kämpf and Chapman, 2016). 
They directly support livelihoods in coastal communities and provide many wider beneﬁts to human society (García-Reyes et al. 2015; 
Levin and Le Bris, 2015). The high productivity of EBUS is supported by the upwelling of cold and nutrient-rich waters, itself driven 
by equator-ward alongshore winds that cause the displacement of surface waters offshore and their replacement by deeper waters. 
Total annual ﬁsh catches from the four main EBUS (California Current, Humboldt Current, Canary Current and Benguela Current) 
were 16–24 tonnes yr–1 in the 2000s, providing around 17% of the global catch (Pauly and Zeller, 2016). These catches are consumed 
locally, as well as being processed and exported as seafood, ﬁsh meals and oils to support aquaculture and livestock production. 
Upwelling of cold deeper water also increases the condensation of humid air in coastal areas, beneﬁtting coastal vegetation and 
agriculture and suppressing forest ﬁres (Black et al. 2014). The high concentration of marine mammals attracted by the productive 
upwelling ecosystem support lucrative eco-tourism, such as whale watching in the California Current (Kämpf and Chapman, 2016). 
The total economic value of the goods and services provided by the Humboldt Current alone is estimated to be 19.45 billion USD per 
year (Gutiérrez et al.). Thus, although their area is small compared to other pelagic ecosystems, climate change impacts on EBUS will 
have disproportionately large consequences for human society (very high conﬁdence).
The coupled human-natural EBUS are vulnerable to the multiple effects of climate change with large regional variation (Blasiak et al. 
2017). Observations and modelling analyses suggest that winds have intensiﬁed in most EBUS (except the Canary Current) during the 
last 60 years, with several hypotheses proposed to explain the mechanisms (Sydeman et al. 2014; García-Reyes et al. 2015; Rykaczewski 
et al. 2015; Varela et al. 2015). ESMs predict reduction of wind and upwelling intensity in EBUS at low latitudes and enhancement at 
high latitudes for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5, with an overall reduction in either upwelling intensity or extension 
(Belmadani et al. 2014; Rykaczewski et al. 2015; Sousa et al. 2017). However, coastal warming and wind intensiﬁcation may lead to 
variable countervailing responses to upwelling intensiﬁcation at local scales (García-Reyes et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015a; Oyarzún and 
Brierley, 2018; Xiu et al. 2018). Local winds and mesoscale oceanographic features (not resolved in most global Earth System Models 
(ESMs)) are thought to have a greater impact on regional productivity than large-scale wind patterns (Renault et al. 2016; Xiu et al. 2018).
There is conﬂicting evidence in sea surface temperature (SST) trends in recent decades, even among the same EBUS, due to varying 
spatio-temporal resolution of SST data and the superimposed effects of interannual to multi-decadal variability (García-Reyes et al. 
2015). Some EBUS are close to important thresholds in terms of oxygenation and ocean acidiﬁcation (Gruber et al. 2012; Franco 
et al. 2018a; Levin, 2018). Large-scale coastal and offshore data for the California Current indicate that there have been decadal 
decreases in pH and dissolved oxygen affecting organisms and ecosystems (Alin et al. 2012; Bednaršek et al. 2014; Breitburg et al. 
2018; Levin, 2018). Model projections for 2100 suggest strong effects of deoxygenation and reduced pH in the Humboldt Current and 
the California Current under RCP8.5 (Gruber et al. 2012; García-Reyes et al. 2015), affecting seaﬂoor habitats and invertebrate ﬁsheries 
(Marshall et al. 2017; Hodgson et al. 2018). For instance, the Humboldt Current is projected to experience widespread aragonite 
undersaturation within a few decades (Franco et al. 2018a), with strong impacts on calciﬁed organisms. Such ocean acidiﬁcation could 
be worsened by synergistic effects of ocean warming and deoxygenation (Lachkar, 2014).
The climate change impacts on ecosystem services from EBUS vary according to the biophysical and the socioeconomic characteristics of 
the upwelling systems (García-Reyes et al. 2015) (SM5.4). The ﬁsheries are not only highly sensitive to upwelling conditions but 
also by ﬁshing effects on the exploited populations. For example, the anchoveta population collapsed in the Humboldt Current after an 
El Niño in the 1970s (Gutiérrez et al. 2017). Because small pelagic ﬁsheries from upwelling regions are the main source of the global 
ﬁshmeal market, decreases in their catches increase the international ﬁshmeal price, increasing the price of other food commodities (like 
aquaculture derived ﬁsh) that rely on ﬁshmeal for their production (Merino et al. 2010; Carlson et al. 2017).

Chapter 5

Box 5.3 (continued)
Any decrease in ﬁsh catches in EBUS will affect regional food security. For example, coastal ﬁsheries in the Canary Current are an 
important source of micronutrients to nearby West African countries (Golden et al. 2016) that have particularly high susceptibility 
to climate change impacts and low adaptive capacity, because of their strong dependence on the ﬁsheries resources, a rapidly 
growing population and regional conﬂicts. Decreased small pelagic ﬁsh stocks also increase the mortality and reduce reproduction 
of larger vertebrates such as hake (Guevara-Carrasco and Lleonart, 2008), whales and seabirds (Essington et al. 2015). Impacts on 
these organisms affect other non-ﬁshing sectors that are dependent on EBUS, such as whale watching in the California Current, 
and generally degrade their intrinsic value.
Overall, EBUS have been changing with intensiﬁcation of winds that drives the upwelling, leading to changes in water temperature 
and other ocean biogeochemistry (medium conﬁdence). Three out of the four major EBUS have shown upwelling intensiﬁcation in 
the past 60 years, with strongly increasing trends in ocean acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation in the two Paciﬁc EBUS in the last few 
decades (high conﬁdence). The expanding oxygen minimum zone in the California EBUS has altered ecosystem structure and and 
ﬁsheries catches (medium conﬁdence). However, the direction and magnitude of observed changes vary among and within EBUS, 
with uncertainties regarding the driving mechanisms behind this variability. Moreover, the high natural variability of EBUS and their 
insufﬁcient representation by global ESMs gives low conﬁdence that these observed changes can be attributed to anthropogenic causes, 
which are predicted to emerge primarily in the second half of the 21st century (medium conﬁdence) (Brady et al. 2017). Given the high 
sensitivity of the coupled human-natural EBUS to oceanographic changes, the future sustainable delivery of key ecosystem services from 
EBUS is at risk under climate change; those that are most at risk in the 21st century include ﬁsheries (high conﬁdence), aquaculture 
(medium conﬁdence), coastal tourism (low conﬁdence) and climate regulation (low conﬁdence). For vulnerable human communities 
with a strong dependence on EBUS services and low adaptive capacity, such as those along the Canary Current system (Belhabib et al. 
2016; Blasiak et al. 2017), unmitigated climate change effects on EBUS (complicated by other non-climatic stresses such as social unrest) 
have a high risk of altering their development pathways (high conﬁdence).
5.4.1.2 
Regulating Services
Regulating services are those ecosystem functions, like climate 
regulation, that allow the environment to be in conditions conducive 
to human well-being and development (Costanza et al. 2017). AR5 
WGII concluded that climate change will alter biological, chemical 
and physical processes in the ocean that provide feedback on the 
climate system through their effects on atmospheric composition 
(high conﬁdence) (Pörtner et al. 2014). Sections 5.2 and 5.3 consider 
new evidence since AR5 regarding climate impacts on marine 
ecosystems and associated risks; their implications for regulating 
services are examined here.
A major regulating service provided by marine ecosystems is carbon 
sequestration. The observed net carbon uptake from the atmosphere 
to the global ocean varied between 1.0–2.5 GtC yr–1 between 2000 
and 2012, with a very likely uptake of 30–38 Gt of anthropogenic C 
over the period 1994–2007 (Section 5.2.2.3, Gruber et  al. 2019). 
Estimates of carbon sequestered in the deep ocean range from 
0.4 GtC yr–1 (Rogers, 2015) to 1.6 GtC yr–1 (Armstrong et al. 2010) 
with the annual burial rate (permanent removal to sediment) around 
0.2 GtC yr–1 (Armstrong et al. 2010).
Deep sea ecosystems also contribute to the removal of methane 
released from the beneath the seabed through microbial anaerobic 
oxidation and the sequestration of methane-derived carbon in 
carbonate (Marlow et  al. 2014; Thurber et  al. 2014). In coastal 
ecosystems, carbon is biologically sequestered in coastal sediments, 
commonly known as ‘blue carbon’ (Section 5.5.1). Tidal wetlands 
play disproportionately important roles in coastal carbon budgets, 
forming critical linkages between rivers, estuaries, and oceans 
(Najjar et al. 2018). Mean carbon storage in the top meter of soil 
is estimated at 280 MgC ha–1 for mangroves, 250 MgC ha–1 for 
salt marshes, and 140 MgC ha–1 for seagrass meadows, with long-
term rates of carbon accumulation in sediments of salt marshes, 
mangroves, and seagrasses ranging from 18–1713 gC m–2 yr–1 
(Pendleton et al. 2012). These values are, however, highly variable 
(Section 5.5.1.2). The large space and time scales mean that there 
is a long time-lag between seaﬂoor change and detectable changes 
in carbon sequestration. These large lags, in turn render assessment 
of climate impacts on regulatory services in the deep ocean having 
low conﬁdence.
Under RCP2.6, CMIP5 ESMs project a reduced net ocean carbon 
uptake by 2080, to around 1.0 GtC yr–1. Under RCP8.5, net ocean 
carbon uptake increases to a net sink of around 5.5 GtC yr–1, but 
with variability between models (Lovenduski et al. 2016). Although 
the open ocean biological pump contributes only part of current 
carbon uptake (Boyd et al. 2019), the downward carbon ﬂux at 1000 
m is projected to decrease by 9–16% globally under RCP8.5 by 2100. 
A projected decrease in carbon sequestration in the North Atlantic 
by 27–41% has been estimated to represent a loss of 170–3000 
billion USD in abatement (mitigation) costs and 23–401 billion 
USD in social costs (Barange et al. 2017). Others have highlighted 
the declining value of open ocean carbon sequestration in the 
eastern tropical Paciﬁc (Martin et al. 2016b) and the Mediterranean 
(Melaku Canu et al. 2015). The open ocean therefore seems very 
likely to reduce its carbon uptake by the end of the 21st century, 
with the reduction very likely being greater under RCP8.5 than for 
RCP2.6; however, speciﬁc projections only have medium conﬁdence

due to uncertainties associated with the structure of the models 
and with the future behaviour of the biological carbon pump 
(Section 5.2.2.3.1, 5.2.3).
Coastal blue carbon ecosystems provide climate regulatory services 
through their carbon removal and storage (Section 5.3.3). The current 
rates of loss of blue carbon ecosystems, partly due to climate change 
(Section 5.3) results in release of their stored CO2 to the atmosphere 
(Section 5.5.1.2.2). However, increases in carbon sequestration are 
also possible; for example, temperature-driven displacement of 
salt marsh plants by mangrove trees may increase carbon uptake 
in coastal wetlands (Megonigal et  al. 2016). Different rates of 
SLR may have opposite effects, with potential increases in net 
carbon uptake for slowly rising sea levels (assuming inland habitat 
migration is possible), but net carbon release for more rapid SLR 
(Figure 5.19). Such contrasting feedbacks between scenarios arise 
from the different responses of plant biomass, sediment accretion 
and inundation that control the overall response of vegetated coastal 
ecosystems to rising sea level (Gonneea et al. 2019). Thus, under high 
emission scenarios, SLR and warming are expected to reduce carbon 
sequestration by vegetated coastal ecosystems (medium conﬁdence); 
however, under conditions of slow SLR, there may be net increase in 
carbon uptake by some coastal wetlands (medium conﬁdence).
Coastal vegetation-rich ecosystems such as mangrove forests, coral 
reefs and salt marshes reduce storm impacts, protect the coastline 
from erosion, and help buffer the impacts of SLR, wave action and 
even moderate-sized tsunamis (Orth et al. 2006; Ferrario et al. 2014; 
Rao et al. 2015) (Section 5.5.2.2). Their loss or degradation under 
climate change (Sections 5.3) would therefore reduce the beneﬁts 
of these regulatory services to coastal human communities (Perry 
et al. 2018), increasing the risk of damage and mortality from natural 
disasters (Rao et  al. 2015) (high conﬁdence). In some locations 
where climate-induced range expansion of coastal wetlands occurs, 
regulatory services such as storm protection and nutrient storage 
may be enhanced; however, the replacement of an existing ecosystem 
by others (e.g.,  salt marshes replaced by mangroves) may reduce 
habitat availability for fauna requiring speciﬁc vegetation structure 
and consequently other types of ecosystem services (Kelleway et al. 
2017b; Sheng and Zou, 2017).
5.4.1.3 
Supporting Services
Supporting ecosystem services are structures and processes, such as 
habitats, biodiversity and productivity, that maintain the ecosystem 
functions that deliver other services (Costanza et al. 2017). Marine 
supporting services include: primary and secondary production; 
habitat provision for feeding, spawning or nursery grounds, and 
refugia; and biodiversity. All these provide essential support for 
provisioning, regulating or cultural services (Haines-Young and

of atmospheric CO2. In addition, below ground root production contributes to the formation of new soils and consolidates the seabed substrates. (B) Under low rate of soil 
formation, and when SLRs exceed critical thresholds, plants become severely stressed by inundation leading to less organic accretion and below ground subsidence and

Potschin, 2013; Bopp et al. 2017). Therefore, climate change impacts 
on supporting services provided by marine ecosystems are directly 
dependent on the risks and impacts on their biodiversity and 
ecosystem functions, which are assessed in Sections 5.2.3, 5.2.4 and 
5.3. Previously, AR5 highlighted the importance of the potential loss 
or degradation of habitat forming calcifying algae and corals, and 
the projected changes in waterways for Arctic shipping (Pörtner et al. 
2014). The latter topic is considered in Chapter 3 and Section 5.4.2.4.
Publications since AR5 provide further evidence that coastal habitats 
are at risk from SLR, warming and other climate-related hazards 
(see Section 5.3). All these changes to supporting services have 
implications for other ecosystem services (Costanza et  al. 2014), 
such as altering ﬁsh catches and their composition (Pratchett et al. 
2014; Carrasquilla-Henao and Juanes, 2017; Maharaj et  al. 2018) 
(Section 5.4.1.1) and carbon sequestration (Section 5.4.1.2). In the 
epipelagic ocean, climate change affects the pattern and magnitude 
of global NPP (Section 5.2.2.6) and the export of organic matter; both 
of these processes support ecosystem services in the deep ocean 
(Section  5.2.4) and elsewhere. Projected ocean acidiﬁcation and 
oxygen loss will also affect deep ocean biodiversity and habitats that 
are linked to provisioning services in the deep ocean (Section 5.2.3.2, 
5.2.4). Overall, there is high conﬁdence that marine habitat loss and 
degradation have already impacted supporting services from many 
marine ecosystems worldwide. The conﬁdence on the attribution of 
those impacts to climate change depends on the assessment of the 
ocean and coastal ecosystems (Section 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.3). Projected 
climate-driven alterations of marine habitats will increase the future 
risks of impacts on supporting services (high conﬁdence).
5.4.1.4 
Cultural Services
Cultural ecosystem services include recreation, tourism, aesthetic, 
cultural identity and spiritual experiences. These services are a product 
of humans experiencing nature and the availability of nature to provide 
the experiences (Chan et al. 2012). There is increasing evidence to 
support the conclusion in WGII AR5 that the intrinsic values and 
cultural importance of marine ecosystems, such as indigenous culture, 
recreational ﬁshing and tourism, that are dependent on biodiversity 
and other ecosystem functions, are at risk from climate change. 
Since marine cultural services are inherently integrated with human 
well-being, their assessment is provided in Section 5.4.2.
5.4.2 
Climate Risk, Vulnerability and Exposure of 
Human Communities and their Well-being
Human communities heavily depend on the ocean through the 
goods and services provided by marine ecosystems (Section 5.4.1) 
(Hilmi et al. 2015). The values of ocean-based economic activities 
are estimated to be trillions of USD, generating hundreds of 
millions of jobs (Hoegh-Guldberg, 2015; Spalding, 2016). As climate 
change is impacting marine biodiversity and ecosystem services 
(Section 5.3.1), human communities and their well-being will also be 
affected. This section is based on diverse types of information, from 
quantitative modelling to qualitative studies, using expert opinion, 
local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box 4 
in Chapter 1). Projection and assessment of risk and vulnerabilities 
not only depend on climate change scenarios but are also strongly 
dependent on scenarios of future social-economic development 
(Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).
This assessment divides the linkages between ecosystem services 
and human communities and their well-being into the three pillars 
of sustainable development, as used by the World Commission on 
Environment and Development. The three pillars are social and 
cultural, economic and environmental. Table 5.6 lists the speciﬁc 
dimensions under these pillars that are assessed in this section. 
Synthesis of risks and opportunities of climate change on human 
communities and well-being is at the end of this section through 
the lens of ocean economy and the United Nations’ Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs).

5.4.2.1.1 Water-borne diseases
SR15 concluded that climate change will result in an aerial expansion 
and increased risk of water-borne disease with regional differences 
(high to very high conﬁdence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). AR5 
concluded that warming, excessive nutrient and seawater inundation 
due to SLR are projected to exacerbate the expansion and threat of 
cholera (Pörtner et al. 2014) (medium conﬁdence). This assessment 
focuses on health risks caused by Vibrio bacteria and HABs. Vibrio 
cholerae (causing cholera) is estimated to be responsible for around 
760,000 and 650,000 cases of human illness and death respectively 
in the world in 2010 (Kirk et al. 2015). An assessment of HABs is 
given in Box 5.4. 
510
Chapter 5 
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

Vibrio species naturally occur in warm, nutrient-rich and low salinity 
coastal waters. Since AR5, analysis of the the Continuous Plankton 
Recorder dataset (Section 5.2.3) has shown a signiﬁcant increase 
in Vibrio abundance in the North Sea over the period 1958–2011 
related to sea surface warming (Vezzulli et al. 2016). Other time series 
data have conﬁrmed a poleward expansion of Vibrio pathogens in 
mid- to high-latitude regions, ascribed at least partly to climate 
change (Baker-Austin et al. 2013; Baker-Austin et al. 2017). Extreme 
weather events such as ﬂooding and tropical cyclones are also 
linked to increased incidences of Vibrio-related disease, suggested 
to be caused by the increased exposure of human populations to the 
pathogens during these extreme events (Baker-Austin et al. 2017). 
New evidence since AR5 therefore increases support for the linkages 
between warming, extreme weather events and increased risk of 
diseases caused by Vibrio bacteria (very high conﬁdence).
Extrapolating from the observed relationship between environmental 
conditions and current Vibrio distributions, coastal areas that 
experience future warming, changes in precipitation and increases in 
nutrient inputs can be expected to see an increase in prevalence of 
Vibrio pathogens. These effects have been simulated in a global-scale 
model that relates occurrences of Vibrio with SST, pH, dissolved oxygen 
and chlorophyll a concentration under the SRES B1 scenario (Escobar 
et al. 2015). In the Baltic Sea, a nearly two-fold increase in the area 
suitable for Vibrio is projected between 2015 and 2050 for both RCP4.5 
and RCP8.5 scenarios (relating to projected SST increase of 4ºC–5ºC), 
resulting in an elevated risk of Vibrio infections (Semenza et al. 2017). 
Projected conditions of increased coastal ﬂooding from storm surges 
and SLR (Section 5.2.2) will also increase exposure to waterborne 
disease (Ashbolt, 2019), such as Vibrio (medium conﬁdence). 
However, uncertainty in the socioeconomic factors affecting the future 
vulnerabilities of human populations render quantitative projections of 
the magnitude of health impacts uncertain (Lloyd et al. 2016). 
Box 5.4 |  Harmful Algal Blooms and Climate Change 
Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are proliferations of phytoplankton (mostly dinoﬂagellates, diatoms and cyanobacteria) and 
macroaglae that have negative effects on marine environments and associated biota. Impacts include water discolouration and 
foam accumulation, anoxia, contamination of seafood with toxins, disruption of food webs and massive large-scale mortality of 
marine biota (Hallegraeff, 2010; Quillien et al. 2015; Amaya et al. 2018; García-Mendoza et al. 2018; Álvarez et al. 2019). The IPCC 5th 
Assessment Report (AR5) concluded that harmful algal outbreaks had increased in frequency and intensity, caused partly by warming, 
nutrient ﬂuctuations in upwelling areas, and coastal eutrophication (medium conﬁdence); however, there was limited evidence and 
low conﬁdence for future climate change effects on HABs (AR5 Chapters 5, 6) (Pörtner et al. 2014; Wong et al. 2014b). Since AR5, 
HABs have increasingly affected human society, with negative impacts on food provisioning, tourism, the economy and human health 
(Anderson et al. 2015; Berdalet et al. 2017). For example, HABs caused an estimated loss of 42 million USD for the tuna industry 
in Baja California, Mexico (García-Mendoza et al. 2018) and mortality of more than 40,000 tonnes of cultivated salmon in Chile 
(Díaz et al. 2019). This additional observational and experimental evidence has improved detection and attribution of HABs to climate 
change, demonstrating that shifts in biogeography, increased abundance and increased toxicity of HABs in recent years have been partly 
or wholly caused by warming and by other, more direct human drivers.
New studies since AR5 show range expansion of warm water HAB species, such as Gambierdiscus that causes ciguatera ﬁsh poisoning 
(Kohli et al. 2014; Bravo et al. 2015; Sparrow et al. 2017); contraction of cold water species (Tester et al. 2010; Rodríguez et al. 2017); the 
detection of novel phycotoxins and toxic species (Akselman et al. 2015; Guinder et al. 2018; Paredes et al. 2019; Tillmann et al. 2019); 
and regional increases in the occurrence and intensity of toxic phytoplankton blooms (McKibben et al. 2017; Díaz et al. 2019) in relation 
to ocean warming. For example, growth of the toxic dinoﬂagellates Alexandrium and Dinophysis, producers of paralytic shellﬁsh 
poisoning and okadaic acid, respectively, is enhanced by warmer conditions in the North Atlantic and North Paciﬁc (Gobler et al. 2017), 
whilst environmental conditions linked with warm phases of El Niño Southern Oscillation ENSO are associated with blooms of toxic 
Pseudo-nitzschia species in the Northern California Current (McKibben et al. 2017), with devastating effects on coastal ecosystems 
(McCabe et al. 2016; Ritzman et al. 2018). Regional variations of trends in HAB occurrences can be explained by spatial differences in 
climate drivers (temperature, water column stratiﬁcation, ocean acidiﬁcation, precipitation and extreme weather events), as well as non-
climatic drivers, such as eutrophication and pollution (Hallegraeff, 2010; Hallegraeff, 2016; Glibert et al. 2018; Paerl et al. 2018). 
Experimental studies have provided additional evidence for the role of environmental drivers in inducing HABs and their degree 
of impact. These studies include those showing that toxin production can be affected by grazers (Tammilehto et al. 2015; Xu and 
Kiørboe, 2018) and changing nutrient levels (Van de Waal et al. 2013; Brunson et al. 2018). The biosynthesis of domoic acid by some 
Pseudo-nitschia species is induced by combined phosphate limitation and high CO2 conditions (Brunson et al. 2018), with their 
growth and toxicity enhanced by warming in incubation experiments (Zhu et al. 2017). Recent mesocosm experiments using natural 
subtropical planktonic communities found that simulated CO2 emission scenarios (between Representative Concentration Pathway 
(RCP)2.6 and RCP8.5 by 2100) improved the competitive ﬁtness of the toxic microalgae Vicicitus globosus for CO2 treatments above 
600 μatm, and induced blooms above 800 μatm, with severe negative impacts for other components of the planktonic food 
web (Riebesell et al. 2018). Experiments with the toxic dinoﬂagellate Akashiwo sanguinea (hemolytic activity) have also shown that 
a combination of high CO2 levels, warming and high irradiance stimulate the growth and toxicity of this HAB species (Ou et al. 2017).

Box 5.4 (continued)
Given the worldwide distribution of the key toxic species of Alexandrium, Pseudo-nitzschia and Dinophysis, if the current 
relationship between warming and the occurrences of HABs associated with these species persists in the future (Gobler et al. 2017; 
Townhill et al. 2018) (medium conﬁdence), the projected changes in ocean conditions can be expected to intensify HAB-related risks for 
coastal biodiversity and ecosystems services (high conﬁdence). The greatest risk is expected for estuarine organisms (Section 5.3.1) 
because HABs occurrences are stimulated by riverine nutrient loads, and exacerbated by warming and the lower dissolved oxygen and 
pH in estuarine environments (Gobler and Baumann, 2016; Paredes-Banda et al. 2018). 
Local scale sustained monitoring programmes and early warning systems for HABs can alert resource managers and stakeholders of their 
potential occurrences so that they can take actions (e.g., toxic seafood alerts or relocation of activities) to reduce the impacts of HABs 
(Anderson et al. 2015; Wells et al. 2015) (high conﬁdence). There is limited evidence in determining the degree to which reduction of 
non-climatic anthropogenic stressors can reduce risk of HABs (Section 5.5.2), although this approach may be effective in some areas (low 
conﬁdence); for example, controlling nutrient inputs from human sources may reduce the risk of occurrence of HABs in the Baltic Sea. 
Other techniques such as active chemical and biological interventions are at experimental stage.
Overall, the occurrence of HABs, their toxicity and risk on natural and human systems are projected to continue to increase with 
warming and rising CO2 in the 21st century (Glibert et al. 2014; Martín-García et al. 2014; McCabe et al. 2016; Paerl et al. 2016; 
Gobler et al. 2017; McKibben et al. 2017; Rodríguez et al. 2017; Paerl et al. 2018; Riebesell et al. 2018) (high conﬁdence). Moreover, 
poleward distributional shifts of HAB species are expected to continue as a result of warming (Townhill et al. 2018). The increasing 
likelihood of occurrences of HABs under climate change also elevates their risks on ecosystem services such as ﬁsheries, aquaculture 
and tourism as well as public health (Section 5.4.2, high conﬁdence). Such risks will be greatest in poorly monitored areas 
(Borbor-Córdova et al. 2018; Cuellar-Martinez et al. 2018). 
5.4.2.1.2 Interactions between climate change and contaminants
Climate change–contaminant interactions can alter the bioaccumulation 
and amplify biomagniﬁcation of several contaminant classes (Boxall 
et  al. 2009; Alava et  al. 2018). This section assesses two types of 
contaminants that are of concern to environmental and human health 
as examples of other contaminants with similar properties (Alava et al. 
2017). These two types of contaminants are the toxic and fat-soluble 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs), as well as the neurotoxic and protein-binding organic form of 
mercury, methylmercury (MeHg) (Alava et al. 2017). POPs and MeHg 
are bioaccumulated by marine organisms and biomagniﬁed in food 
webs, reaching exposure concentrations that become harmful and toxic 
to populations of apex predators such as marine mammals (Desforges 
et  al. 2017; Desforges et  al. 2018) (Figure 5.20). Human exposure 
to POPs and MeHg can lead to serious health effects (Ishikawa and 
Ikegaki, 1980; UNEP, 2013; Fort et al. 2015; Scheuhammer et al. 2015).
Inorganic forms of mercury are more soluble in low pH water, while 
higher temperature increases mercury uptake and the metabolic 
activity of bacteria, thereby increasing mercury methylation, uptake 
by organisms and bioaccumulation rates (Scheuhammer, 1991; 
Celo et al. 2006; López et al. 2010; Macdonald and Loseto, 2010; 
Riget et al. 2010; Corbitt et al. 2011; Krabbenhoft and Sunderland, 
2013; Roberts et al. 2013; de Orte et al. 2014; McKinney et al. 2015), 
although there is limited evidence on the extent of exacerbation by 
ocean acidiﬁcation expected in the 21st century. Increased melting of 
snow and ice from alpine ecosystems and mountains (Chapter 2) can 
also increase the release of POPs and MeHg from land-based sources 
into coastal ecosystems (Morrissey et al. 2005). Modelling projections 
for the Faroe Islands region suggest increased bioaccumulation of 
methyl mercury under climate change, with an average increases in 
MeHg concentrations in marine species of 1.6–1.8% and 4.1–4.7% 
under ocean warming scenarios of 0.8ºC and 2.0ºC, respectively, with 
an associated increase in potential human intake of mercury beyond 
levels recommended by the World Health Organization (Booth and 
Zeller, 2005). Foodweb modeling for the northeastern Paciﬁc projects 
that concentrations of MeHg and PCBs in top predators could 
increase by 8% and 3%, respectively, by 2100 under RCP8.5 relative 
to current levels (Alava et al. 2018). Climate-related pollution risks 
are of particular concern in Arctic ecosystems and their associated 
indigenous communities because of the bioaccumulation of POPs 
and MeHg, causing long-term contamination of traditional seafoods 
(Marques et al. 2010; Tirado et al. 2010; Alava et al. 2017) of high 
dietary importance (Cisneros-Montemayor et al. 2016). 
Overall, climate change can increase the exposure and bioaccumulation 
of contaminants and thus the risk of impacts of POPs and MeHg on 
marine ecosystems and their dependent human communities as 
suggested by indirect evidence and model simulations (Marques 
et al. 2010; Tirado et al. 2010; Alava et al. 2017) (high agreement). 
However, there is limited evidence on observed increase in POPs and 
MeHg due to climate change. Apex predators and human communities 
that consume them, including Arctic communities and other coastal 
indigenous populations, are thus vulnerable to increase in exposure to 
these contaminants and the resulting health effects (medium evidence, 
medium agreement). 
The risk of microplastics has become a major concern for the 
ocean as they are highly persistent and have accumulated in many 
different marine environments, including the deep sea (Woodall 
et al. 2014; GESAMP, 2015; van Sebille et al. 2015; Waller et al. 2017; 
512
Chapter 5 
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities
5
de Sá et al. 2018; Everaert et al. 2018; Botterell et al. 2019). There is 
limited evidence at present to assess their risk to marine ecosystems, 
wildlife and potentially humans through human consumption of 
seafood under climate change. 
5.4.2.1.3 Food security 
Seafood provides protein, fatty acids, vitamins and other micronutrients 
essential for human health such as iodine and selenium (Golden 
et al. 2016). Over 4.5 billion people in the world obtain more than 
15% of their protein intake from seafood, including algae and marine 
mammals as well as ﬁsh and shellﬁsh (Béné et al. 2015; FAO, 2017). 
Around 1.39 billion people obtain at least 20% of their supply of 
essential micronutrients from ﬁsh (Golden et al. 2016). SR15 concluded 
that global warming poses large risks to food security globally and 
regionally, especially in low-latitude areas, including ﬁsheries (medium 
conﬁdence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). This section builds on the 
assessment on observed and projected climate impacts on ﬁsh catches 
(Section 5.4.1.1) and further assess how such impacts interact with 
other climatic and non-climatic drivers in affecting food security 
through ﬁsheries.
Many populations that are already facing challenges in food 
insecurity reside in low-latitude regions such as in the Paciﬁc Islands 
and West Africa where maximum ﬁsheries catch potential is projected 
to decrease under climate change security (Golden et al. 2016; Hilmi 
et  al. 2017) (Section 5.4.1; Figure 5.21) and where land-based 
food production is also at risk (Blanchard et  al. 2017) (medium 
conﬁdence). Populations in these regions are also estimated to have 
the highest proportion of their micronutrient intake relative to the 
total animal sourced food (Golden et al. 2016) (ASF; Figure 5.21). 
This highlights their strong dependence on seafood as a source of 
nutrition that further elevates their vulnerability to food security 
from climate change impacts on seafood supply (high conﬁdence). 
Modeling of seafood trade networks suggests that Central and 
West African nations are particularly vulnerable to shocks from 
decrease in seafood supply from international imports; thus their 
climate risks of seafood insecurity could be exacerbated by climate 
impacts on catches and seafood supply elsewhere (Gephart et al. 
2016). In addition, experimental studies suggest that warming and 
ocean acidiﬁcation reduce the nutritional quality of some seafood by 
reducing levels of protein, lipid and omega-3 fatty acids (Tate et al. 
2017; Ab Lah et al. 2018; Lemasson et al. 2019). 
Non-climatic factors may exacerbate climate effects on seafood security. 
Over-exploitation of ﬁsh stocks reduces ﬁsh catches (Section 5.4.1.1) 
(Golden et al. 2016), whilst strong cultural dependence on seafood 
in many coastal communities may pose constraints in their adaptive

capacity to changing ﬁsh availability (Marushka et al. 2019). The shift 
from traditional nutritious wild caught seafood-based diets of coastal 
indigenous communities, towards increased consumption of processed 
energy dense foods high in fat, reﬁned sugar and sodium, due to social 
and economic changes (Kuhnlein and Receveur, 1996; Shannon, 2002; 
Charlton et al. 2016; Batal et al. 2017), has important consequences on 
diet quality and nutritional status (Thaman, 1982; Quinn et al. 2012; 
Luick et al. 2014). This has led to an increased prevalence of obesity, 
diabetes, and other diet-related chronic diseases (Gracey, 2007; Sheikh 
et al. 2011) as well as the related decrease in access to culturally or 
religiously signiﬁcant food items. The risk of climate change on coastal 
communities through the ocean could therefore be increased by 
non-climatic factors such as economic development, trade, effectiveness 
of resource governance and cultural changes (high conﬁdence). 
In summary, the food security of many coastal communities, 
particularly in low-latitude developing regions, is vulnerable to 
decreases in seafood supply (medium conﬁdence) because of their 
strong dependence on seafood to meet their basic nutritional 
requirements (medium conﬁdence), limited alternative sources of 
some of the essential nutrients obtained from seafood (medium 
conﬁdence), and exposure to multiple hazards on their food security 
(high conﬁdence). Although direct evidence from attribution analysis 
is not available, climate change may have already contributed to 
malnutrition by decreasing seafood supply in these vulnerable 
communities (low conﬁdence) and reduce coastal Indigenous 
communities’ reliance on seafood-based diets (low conﬁdence). 
Projected decreases in potential ﬁsh catches in tropical areas (high 
conﬁdence) and a possible decrease in the nutritional content of 
seafood (low conﬁdence) will further increase the risk of impacts on 
food security in low-latitude developing regions, with that risk being 
greater under high emission scenarios (medium conﬁdence).
5.4.2.2 
Cultural and Other Social Dimensions
5.4.2.2.1 Cultural and aesthetic values
Climate change threatens key cultural dimensions of lives and 
livelihoods (Adger et  al. 2012), because people develop strong 
cultural ties and associate distinctive meanings with many natural 
places and biota in the form of traditions, customs and ways of 
life (Marshall et  al. 2018). These impacts have been felt both 
by indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. Recent estimates 
suggest that there are more than 1900 indigenous groups along 
the coastline with around 27 million people across 87 countries 
(Cisneros-Montemayor et  al. 2016). AR5 concluded that climate 
change will affect the harvests of marine species with spiritual and 
aesthetic importance to indigenous cultures (Pörtner et al. 2014).

and the implication for well-being of people, complementing the 
assessment for Arctic indigenous people in Chapter 3. 
Indigenous knowledge is passed and appreciated over timeframes 
ranging from several generations to a few centuries (Cross-Chapter 
Box 4 in Chapter 1). The adjustment of the transmission and the 
network of Indigenous knowledge on the ocean and coasts, and 
related perceptions and practice, implies a reworking of these 
knowledge systems where the individuals and the groups are actors 
in a narrative and historical construction (Roué, 2012; Alderson-Day 
et al. 2015). SLR is already transforming the seascape, such as the 
shape of shores in many low-lying islands in the Paciﬁc, leading to 
modiﬁcation or disappearance of geomorphological features that 
represent gods and mythological ancestors (Camus, 2017; Kench et al. 
2018). These changing seascape also affects the mobility of people and 
residence patterns, and consequently, the structure and transmission 
of Indigenous knowledge (Camus, 2017). The fear of SLR and climate 
change encourage security measures and the grouping of local people 
to the safest places, contributing to the erosion of indigenous culture 
and their knowledge about the ocean (Bambridge and Le Meur, 2018), 
and impairment of opportunity for social elevation for some Paciﬁc 
indigenous communities (Borthwick, 2016).
Climate change is also projected to shift the biogeography and 
potential catches of ﬁshes and invertebrates (5.2.3.1, 5.3, 5.4.1.1) 
that form an integral part of the culture, economy and diet of many 
indigenous communities, such as those situated along the Paciﬁc 
Coast of North America (Lynn et  al. 2013). Indigenous ﬁshing 
communities that depend on traditional marine resources for food 
and economic security are particularly vulnerable to climate change 
through reduced capacity to conduct traditional harvests because of 
reduced access to, or availability of, resources (Larsen et al. 2014; 
Weatherdon et  al. 2016). Overall, the transmission of Indigenous 
culture and knowledge is at risk because of SLR affecting sea- and 
land-scapes, the availability and access to culturally important 
marine species, and communities’ reliance on the ocean for their 
livelihood and their cultural beliefs (medium conﬁdence). Strong 
attachment to traditional marine-based livelihoods has also been 
reported for non-indigenous communities in Canada (Davis, 2015), 
the USA (Paolisso et al. 2012), Spain (Ruiz et al. 2012) and Australia 
(Metcalf et al. 2015). Reduction in populations of ﬁsh species that 
have supported livelihoods for generations, and deteriorations of 
iconic elements of seascapes are putting the well-being of these 
communities at risk (high conﬁdence).
Other cultural values supported by the ocean are diverse. They 
include education, based on knowledge of marine environments. 
Such education can increase knowledge and awareness of climate 
change impacts and the efﬁcacy of their mitigation (Meadows, 2011); 
it can also inﬂuence the extent to which stewardship activities are 
adopted (von Heland et al. 2014; Wynveen and Sutton, 2015; Bennett 
et al. 2018), and can help develop new networks between coastal 
people and environmental managers for the purposes of planning 
and implementing new adaptation strategies (Wynveen and Sutton, 
2015). A critical element in reducing vulnerability to climate change 
is to educate people that they are an integral part of the Earth 
system and have a huge inﬂuence on the balance of the system. 
An important marine ecosystem service is to support such education 
(Malone, 2016). Thus, education can play a pivotal role in how 
climate change is perceived and experienced, and marine biodiversity 
and ecosystems play an important role in this. At the same time, 
climate change impacts on marine ecosystems (Sections 5.2.3, 5.2.4) 
can affect the role of the ocean in supporting such public education 
(medium evidence, high agreement, medium conﬁdence).
The aesthetic appreciation of natural places is one of the 
fundamental ways in which people relate to their environment. 
AR5 noted that climate change may impact marine species with 
aesthetic importance that affect local and indigenous cultures, 
local economies and challenge cultural preservation (Pörtner et al. 
2014). Evidence since AR5 conﬁrms that aesthetically appreciated 
aspects of marine ecosystems are important for supporting local 
and international economies (especially through tourism), human 
well-being, and stewardship. For example, Marshall et  al. (2018) 
found that aesthetic values are a critically important cultural value 
for all cultural groups, and are important for maintaining sense of 
place, pride, identity and opportunities for inspiration, spirituality, 
recreation and well-being. However, climate change induced 
degradation and loss of biodiversity and habitats (Section 5.2.3, 
5.2.4, 5.3) can also negatively impact the ecosystem features that 
are currently appreciated by human communities, such as coral reefs, 
mangroves, charismatic species (such as some marine mammals and 
seabirds) and geomorphological features (e.g., sandy beaches). There 
are also aesthetic and inspirational values of marine biodiversity and 
ecosystems that are important to the psychological and spiritual 
well-being of people, including ﬁlm, literature, art and recreation 
(Pescaroli and Magni, 2015). Other cultural dimensions that are 
becoming more widely acknowledged as potentially disturbed by 
climate change include the appreciation of scientiﬁc, artistic, spiritual, 
and health opportunities, as well as appreciation of biodiversity, 
lifestyle and aesthetics (Marshall et al. 2018). Thus, climate change 
may also affect the way in which marine ecosystems support human 
well-being through cultural dimensions. However, the difﬁculties in 
evaluating the importance of aesthetic aspects of marine ecosystems, 
and in detecting and attributing of climate change impacts, result in 
such assessment having low conﬁdence. 
Climate change affects human cultures and well-being differently. 
For example, Marshall et  al. (2018) assessed the importance of 
identity, pride, place, aesthetics, biodiversity, lifestyle, scientiﬁc value 
and well-being within the Great Barrier Reef region by 8,300 people 
across multiple cultural groups. These groups included indigenous and 
non-indigenous local residents, Australians (non-local), international 
and domestic tourists, tourism operators, and commercial ﬁshers. 
They found that all groups highly rated all (listed) cultural values, 
suggesting that these values are critically associated with iconic 
ecosystems. Climate change impacts upon the Great Barrier Reef, 
through increased temperatures, cyclones and SLR that cumulatively 
degrade the quality of the Reef, are therefore liable to result in cultural 
impacts for all groups. However, survey that assess the emotional 
responses to degradation of the Great Barrier Reef by similar 
stakeholder groups reported different levels of impacts among these 
groups (Marshall et  al. 2019). Therefore, many ocean and coastal 
dependent communities value marine ecosystems highly and climate 
515

impacts can affect their well-being, although the sensitivity to such 
impacts can vary among stakeholder groups (Marshall et al. 2019) 
(low conﬁdence).
Climate change may alter the environment too rapidly for cultural 
adaptation to keep pace. This is because the culture that forms 
around a natural environment can be so integral to people’s lives 
that disassociation from that environment can induce a sense of 
disorientation and disempowerment (Fisher and Brown, 2015). 
The adaptive capacity of people to moderate or inﬂuence cultural 
impacts, and thereby reduce vulnerability to such impacts, is also 
culturally determined (Cinner et  al. 2018). For example, when 
a resource user such as a ﬁsher, farmer, or forester is suddenly faced 
with the prospect that their resource-based occupation is no longer 
viable, they lose not only a means of earning an income but also an 
important part of their identity (Marshall et al. 2012; Tidball, 2012). 
Loss of identity can, in turn, have severe economic, psychological and 
cultural impacts (Turner et al. 2008). Climate change can quickly alter 
the quality of, or access to, a natural resource through degradation 
or coastal inundation, so that livelihoods and lifestyles are no longer 
able to be supported by that resource. When people are displaced 
from places that they value, there is strong evidence that their 
cultures are diminished, and in many cases endangered. There are no 
effective substitutions for, or adequate compensation for, lost sites 
of signiﬁcance (Adger et al. 2012). As sensitive marine ecosystems 
such as coral reefs and kelp forest are impacted by climate change at 
rapid rate (Section 5.3), these can lead to the loss of part of people’s 
cultural identity and values beyond the rate at which identify and 
values can be adjusted or substituted (medium conﬁdence).
5.4.2.2.2 Potential conﬂicts in resource utilisation 
Redistribution of marine species in response to direct and indirect 
effects of climate change may also disrupt existing marine resource 
sharing and associated governance (Miller and Russ, 2014; Pinsky 
et al. 2018). These effects have contributed to disputes in international 
ﬁsheries management for North Atlantic mackerel (Spijkers and 
Boonstra, 2017) and Paciﬁc salmon (Miller and Russ, 2014). These 
disagreements have stressed diplomatic relations in some cases 
(Pinsky et  al. 2018). Decreases and ﬂuctuations in ﬁsh stock 
abundance and ﬁsh catches have also contributed to past disputes 
(Belhabib et al. 2016; Pomeroy et al. 2016; Blasiak et al. 2017). Under 
climate change, shifts in abundance and distribution of ﬁsh stocks 
are projected to intensify in the 21st century (Sections 5.2.3, 5.3, 
5.4.1.1). Stocks may locally increase and decrease elsewhere. New 
or increased ﬁshing opportunities may be created when exploited 
ﬁsh stocks shift their distribution into a country’s waters where their 
abundance was previously too low to support viable ﬁsheries (Pinsky 
et al. 2018). The number of new transboundary stocks occurring in 
exclusive economic zones worldwide was projected to be around 
46 and 60 under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively, by 2060 relative 
to 1950–2014 (Pinsky et al. 2018). However, such alteration of the 
sharing of resources between countries would challenge existing 
international ﬁsheries governance regimes and, without sufﬁcient 
adaptation responses, increase the potential for disputes in resource 
allocation and management (Belhabib et  al. 2018; Pinsky et  al. 
2018). Overall, projected climate change impacts on ﬁsheries in the 
21st century increase the risk of potential conﬂicts among ﬁshery 
area users and authorities or between two different communities 
within the same country (Ndhlovu et al. 2017; Shaffril et al. 2017; 
Spijkers and Boonstra, 2017) (medium conﬁdence), exacerbated 
through competing resource exploitation from international actors 
and mal-adapted policies (low conﬁdence). Such risks can be reduced 
by appropriate ﬁsheries governance responses that are discussed in 
Sections 5.5.2 and 5.5.3.
5.4.2.3 
Monetary and Material Wealth
5.4.2.3.1 Wealth generated from ﬁsheries 
Global gross revenues from marine ﬁsheries were around 150 billion 
in 2010 USD (Swartz et al. 2013; Tai et al. 2017). Capture ﬁsheries 
provide full-time and part-time jobs for an estimated 260 ± 6 million 
people in the 2000s period, of whom 22 ± 0.45 million are small-scale 
ﬁshers (Teh and Sumaila, 2013). Small-scale ﬁsheries are important 
for the livelihood and viability of coastal communities worldwide 
(Chuenpagdee, 2011). AR5 concluded with low conﬁdence that 
climate change will lead to a global decrease in revenue with regional 
differences that are driven by spatial variations of climate impacts on 
and the ﬂexibility and capacities of food production systems (Pörtner 
et al. 2014). AR5 also highlighted the high vulnerability of mollusc 
aquaculture to ocean acidiﬁcation. For example, the oyster industry 
in the Paciﬁc has lost nearly 110 million USD in annual revenue due 
to ocean acidiﬁcation (Ekstrom et al. 2015). This section examines 
the rapidly growing literature assessing the risks of climate change 
on ﬁsheries and aquaculture sectors, and the potential interaction 
between climatic and non-climatic drivers on the economics of 
ﬁsheries. However, new evidence on observed economic impacts 
of climate change on ﬁsheries since AR5 is limited. 
Since AR5, projections on climate change impacts on the economics 
of marine ﬁsheries have incorporated a broader range of social-
economic considerations. Driven by shifts in species distributions and 
maximum catch potential of ﬁsh stocks (Section 5.4.1), if the ex-vessel 
price of catches remains the same, marine ﬁsheries maximum 
revenue potential are projected to be negatively impacted in 89% of 
the world’s ﬁshing countries under the RCP8.5 scenario by the 2050s 
relative to the current status, with projected global decreases of 
10.4 ± 4.2% and 7.1 ± 3.5% under RCP8.5 and RCP2.6, respectively, 
by 2050 relative to 2000 (Lam et  al. 2016). While the projected 
changes in revenues are sensitive to price scenarios (Lam et al. 2016), 
future maximum revenue potential is reduced under high emission 
scenarios (Sumaila et  al. 2019). For example, when the elasticity 
of seafood price in relation to their supply was modelled explicitly, 
ﬁsheries maximum revenue potential under a 1.5ºC atmospheric 
warming scenario was projected to be higher than for 3.5ºC warming 
by 7.4% (13.1 billion USD) ± 2.3%, across projections from three 
CMIP5 models (Sumaila et al. 2019). Accounting for the subsequent 
impacts on the dependent communities and relative to the 1.5ºC 
warming scenario, that study also projected a decrease in seafood 
workers’ incomes of 7.8% (3.7 billion USD) ± 2.3% and an increase 
in households’ seafood expenditure by the global population of 3.2% 
(6.3 billion USD) ± 3.9% annually under a 3.5ºC warming scenario 
(Sumaila et al. 2019). 
516

Fisheries management strategies and ﬁshing effort affect the 
realised catch and economic beneﬁts of ﬁshing (Barange, 2019). 
Modelling analysis of ﬁsh stocks with available data worldwide 
showed that for RCP6.0, adaptation of ﬁsheries by accommodating 
shifts in species distribution and abundance, as well as rebuilding 
existing overexploited or depleted ﬁsh stocks, is projected to lead 
to substantially higher global proﬁts (154%), harvest (34%), and 
biomass (60%) in the future, relative to a no adaptation scenario. 
However, the total proﬁt, harvest and biomass are negatively affected 
even with the full adaptation scenario under RCP8.5 (Gaines et al. 
2018). Overall, climate change impacts on the abundance, distribution 
and potential catches of ﬁsh stocks (see Section 5.3.1) are expected 
to reduce the maximum potential revenues of global ﬁsheries (high 
agreement, medium evidence, medium conﬁdence). These impacts on 
ﬁsheries will increase the risk of impacts on the income and livelihoods 
of people working in these economic sectors by 2050 under high 
greenhouse gas emission scenarios relative to low emission scenario 
(high conﬁdence). Rebuilding overexploited or depleted ﬁsheries can 
help improve economic efﬁciency and reduce climate risk, provided 
that emissions are greatly reduced (medium conﬁdence).
The economic implications of climate change on ﬁsheries vary 
between regions and countries because of the differences in exposure 
to revenue changes and the sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the 
ﬁshing communities to these changes (Hilmi et al. 2015). Regions 
where the maximum potential revenue is projected to decrease 
coincide with areas where indicators such as human development 
index suggest high economic vulnerability to climate change 
(Barbier, 2015; Lam et al. 2016). Many coastal communities in these 
regions rely heavily on ﬁsh and ﬁsheries as a major source of animal 
proteins, nutritional needs, income and job opportunities (FAO, 
2019). Negative impacts on the catch and total ﬁsheries revenues 
for these countries are expected to have greater implications for 
jobs, economies, food and nutritional security than the impacts on 
regions with high Human Development Index (Allison et al. 2009; 
Srinivasan et al. 2010; Golden et al. 2016; Blasiak et al. 2017). Climate 
change impacts to coral reefs and other ﬁsh habitats, as well as to 
targeted ﬁsh and invertebrate species themselves are expected to 
reduce harvests from small-scale, coastal ﬁsheries by up to 20% by 
2050, and by up to 50% by 2100, under RCP8.5 (Bell et al. 2018a). 
Therefore, climate risk to communities that are strongly dependent 
on ﬁsheries associated with ecosystems that are particularly sensitive 
to climate change such as coral reefs will have be particularly high 
(Cinner et al. 2016) (high conﬁdence). 
Climate change may also worsen by non-climate related 
socioeconomic shocks and stresses, and hence is an obstacle to 
economic developments (Hallegatte et al. 2015). Climate risk on the 
economics of ﬁshing is projected to be higher for tropical developing 
countries where existing adaptive capacity to the risk is lower, 
thereby challenging their sustainable economic development (high 
conﬁdence). However, observed impacts are not yet well documented 
(Lacoue-Labarthe et  al. 2016), and there are many uncertainties 
relating to how climate change would affect the dynamics of ﬁshing 
costs, with consequent adjustment of ﬁshing effort that might 
intensify or lessen the overcapacity issue. Studies have attempted to 
project how ﬁshers may respond to changes in ﬁsh distribution and 
abundance by incorporating different management systems (Haynie 
and Pfeiffer, 2012; Galbraith et al. 2017). However, the impacts of 
climate change on management effectiveness and trade practices is 
still inadequately understood (Galbraith et al. 2017). 
5.4.2.3.2 Wealth generated from coastal  
and marine tourism sector 
Tourism is one of the largest sectors in the global economy. Between 
1995–1998 and 2011–2014, the average total contribution of 
tourism to global GDP increased from 69 billion USD (6.8%) to 
166  billion USD (8.5%) respectively, and generated more than 
21 million jobs between 2011–2014 (UNCTAD, 2018). Coastal 
tourism and other marine-related recreational activities contributes 
substantially to the tourism sector (Cisneros-Montemayor et  al. 
2013; O’Malley et al. 2013; Spalding et al. 2017; Giorgio et al. 2018; 
UNWTO, 2018). For example, it is estimated that around 121 million 
people a year participated in marine-based recreational activities, 
generating 47 billion in 2003 USD in expenditures and supporting 
one million jobs (Cisneros-Montemayor and Sumaila, 2010). Tourism 
is one of the main industries that provides opportunities for social 
and economic development (Jiang and DeLacy, 2014), and marine 
tourism is particularly important for many coastal developing 
countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). AR5 identiﬁed 
the tourism sector in the Caribbean region as particularly vulnerable 
to climate change effects, due to hurricanes, whilst SR15 concluded 
that warming will directly affect climate-dependent tourism markets 
on a worldwide basis (medium conﬁdence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 
2018). This assessment provides updates since AR5 and SR15. 
Empirical modelling of future risks to tourism is based on projected 
climate impacts (Section 5.3) for relevant coastal ecosystems, including 
degradation or loss of beach and coral reef assets (Weatherdon et al. 
2016) (Section 4.3.3.6.2). These projections are developed from the 
relationship between the economic beneﬁts generated from coral 
reef related tourism with observed characteristics of coral reefs, the 
characteristics of tourism activities. Based on scenarios of projected 
future warming and decreases in coral reef coverage, a global loss 
of tourism and recreation value in the near-future (2031–2050) of 
2.57–2.95 billion yr–1 in 2000 USD is projected under RCP2.6, and 
of 3.88–5.80 billion yr–1 in 2000 USD under RCP8.5 (Chen et  al. 
2015). Opinion surveys in four countries suggest that if severe coral 
bleaching persists in the Great Barrier Reef, tourism in adjacent areas 
could greatly decline, from 2.8 million to around 1.7 million visitors 
per year, equivalent to more than 1 billion AUS (~0.69 billion USD 
using exchange rate in 2019), that is, in tourism expenditure and with 
potential loss of around 10,000 jobs (Swann and Campbell, 2016). 
Many coastal tourism destinations are exposed to risks of ﬂooding, 
SLR and coastal squeeze on coastal ecosystems (Lithgow et al. 2019) 
(Section 5.3); there are also other climate related-risks. Droughts, 
which are projected to be more frequent, will also impact the tourism 
industry (and local food security) through water and food shortages 
(Pearce et al. 2018). If climate change and ocean acidiﬁcation reduce 
the seafood supply, the attractiveness of coastal regions for tourists 
will also decrease (Wabnitz et al. 2017). North Atlantic hurricanes 
and tropical storms have increased in intensity over the last 30 years, 
517
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5
5
with climate projections indicating an increasing trend in hurricane 
intensity (Chapter 6). Three major Caribbean storms, Harvey, Irma 
and Maria, occurred in 2017, with loss and damage to the tourism 
industries of Dominica, the British Virgin Islands, and Antigua and 
Barbuda estimated at 2.2 billion USD, and environmental recovery 
costs estimated at 6.8 million USD (UNDP, 2017). Paciﬁc tourist 
destinations, which tend to focus on nature-based and marine 
activities, are also at high risk of extreme events and other climate 
change impacts (Klint et  al. 2015). However, global tourism has 
a high carbon footprint (ﬂights, cruises, etc.) (Lenzen et al. 2018), 
so any reduction in the intensity of this sector would help mitigate 
climate change. 
Evidence from recent studies on projected climate risks on recreational 
ﬁshing is equivocal, with the direction of impacts depending on 
the location, species targeted and societal context. For example: 
poleward range shifts of marine ﬁsh (Section 5.2.3) could yield new 
opportunities for recreational ﬁshing in mid- to high-latitude regions 
(DiSegni and Shechter, 2013); projected increases in air temperature 
may enable longer ﬁshing days in some area (Dundas and von 
Haefen, 2015); and extreme events may alter the composition of 
recreational ﬁshing catches (Santos et al. 2016). Since climate risks 
to recreational ﬁshing vary largely depending on the responses of the 
targeted species to climate-related pressures, there is low conﬁdence 
in the overall risk to the activity. 
Overall, evidence since AR5 and SR15 conﬁrms that climate impacts 
to coastal ecosystems would increase risks to coastal tourism, 
particularly under high emission scenarios (medium conﬁdence). 
Economic impacts will be greatest for those developing countries 
where tourism is the main source of foreign revenue (medium to 
high evidence).
5.4.2.3.3 Property values 
The integrity of ecosystems and their services can affect the value 
of human assets, particularly coastal properties and infrastructure 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). Climate change is expected to have 
negative impacts on coastal properties and their value through 
the loss and damage caused by SLR, increased storm intensity 
(hurricanes and cyclones), heat waves, ﬂoods, droughts and other 
extreme events, particularly in tropical SIDS (Chapter 4). Natural 
disasters already cost Paciﬁc Island Countries and Territories between 
0.5–6.6% of GDP yr–1 (World Bank, 2017), with localised damages 
and losses from individual storms far exceeding these estimates 
(e.g., 64% of Vanuatu’s GDP for Cyclone Pam in 2015). The impacts 
of natural disasters on Jamaica’s coastal transport infrastructure 
are currently estimated to be a signiﬁcant proportion of their GDP, 
and such costs are projected to increase substantially in the next 
few decades under climate change (UNCTAD, 2017; Monioudi et al. 
2018). In 2015, tropical storm Erika devastated Dominica causing 
483 million USD in damages and losses (mostly related to transport, 
housing and agriculture), equivalent to 90% of Dominica’s GDP 
(World Bank, 2017). For the USA, Ackerman and Stanton (2007) 
forecast that annual real estate losses due to climate change could 
increase from 0.17% of GDP in 2025 to 0.36% in 2100, with Atlantic 
and Gulf Coast states being the most vulnerable. Other North 
American studies have shown that informed coastal property owners 
are willing to initially invest in infrastructure to counter climate 
change impacts (McNamara and Keeler, 2013); however, they would 
avoid further investment if adaptation costs increase substantially 
and there are greater risks of long-term impacts (Putra et al. 2015).
The impacts of changing marine ecosystems and ecosystem services 
on the value of human assets need to consider the risk perception, 
future development and adaptation responses of human communities 
(Section 5.5.2, Chapter 4) (Bunten and Kahn, 2014). For example, the 
potential for climate impacts on the value of coastal real estate will 
depend on the changing insurance market or the cost of adaptation 
measures, which in turn depend on the willingness to pay by asset 
holders and wider society, including local and national governments. 
Further research is needed to discount valuations for potential losses 
that may occur in the future but with uncertain occurrence, and to 
improve real estate loss estimates over local to regional scales. 
Marine ecosystem services contribute to climate moderation and 
coastal defenses (Section 5.4.1.2). However, while the above studies 
in this section acknowledge the contribution of many climate 
impacts on real estate and infrastructure through ecosystem losses 
and degradation, often they are not accounted for in quantitative 
economic impact assessments. Overall, there is high conﬁdence 
that SLR, increases in storm intensity and other extreme events 
will impact the values of coastal real estates and infrastructure, 
particularly in tropical SIDS, through the risk and impacts of direct 
physical damages. However, there is low conﬁdence that impacts due 
to underlying loss and damage of ecosystems and their services are 
being similarly accounted for.
5.4.2.4 
Risk and Opportunities for Ocean Economy 
The ‘ocean economy’ refers to the sustainable use of ocean resources 
for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean 
ecosystem health (World Bank, 2017). In SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg 
et al. 2018) and elsewhere here (Chapters 3 and 5), the risks and 
opportunities of speciﬁc sectors that contribute to the ocean economy 
under climate change are assessed. The ﬁshing industry is particularly 
important in this context. As previously noted, warming has already 
directly impacted coastal and open ocean ﬁshing activities in some 
regions (Section 5.4.1.1, 5.4.2.3.1); the risk of ﬁshery impacts is 
exacerbated by the observed climate-driven changes to coral reefs 
and other coastal ecosystems that contribute to the productivity 
of exploited ﬁsh species (Section 5.4.1.3, 5.4.2.3.1); and there are 
challenges to sustainable management of transboundary ﬁsheries 
resources caused by species’ range shifts and associated governance 
challenges (Section 5.4.2.2.2).
Fisheries-related national and local economies of many tropical 
developing countries are exposed high climate risks (Section 5.4.2.3.1) 
(Blasiak et  al. 2017), as a result of the projected large decrease 
in maximum catch and revenue potential under RCP8.5 in the 
21st century (Section 5.4.1.1). Historical examples from ﬁshery over-
exploitation indicate that a large decrease in catches for speciﬁc ﬁsh 
stocks have had substantial negative effects for dependent economies 
and communities (Brierley and  Kingsford,  2009; Davis,  2015).

Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

Moreover,  coastal economies that are dependent on marine 
tourism and recreational activities are also exposed to elevated 
risks from impacts on biota that are important for these sectors 
(Section  5.4.2.3.2). Nevertheless, new opportunities for coastal 
tourism may occur in future for some regions as a result of species’ 
biogeographic shifts (Section 5.4.2.3.2) and increased accessibility, 
such as in the Arctic (Chapter 3). 
Decrease in sea ice in the Arctic is opening up economic opportunities 
for the oil and gas exploration, mining industries and shipping that 
are currently important economic sectors in the ocean (Pelletier and 
Guy, 2012; George, 2013) (Section 3.4.3; 3.5.3). Although the Arctic 
region has oil and gas reserves estimated to account for one-tenth of 
world oil and a quarter of global gas (U.S. Geological Survey released 
on 24 July 2008), offshore oil and gas exploration with poor regulation 
or as a result of accidents poses additional risk of impacts on species, 
populations, assemblages, to ecosystems by modifying a variety of 
ecological parameters (e.g., biodiversity, biomass, and productivity) 
(Cordes et al. 2016) threatening the sensitive Arctic ecosystems and 
the livelihood of dependent communities (Section 3.5.3.3). 
Similarly, global warming and changing weather patterns may have 
a substantial impact on global trade and transport pathways (Koetse 
and Rietveld, 2009); for example, the reduction in sea ice in the Arctic 
Ocean during summer opens up the possibility for sea transport on the 
Northwest or Northeast Passage for several months per year (Ng et al. 
2018) (Section 3.5.3.2). Both routes may provide opportunities for 
more efﬁcient transport between North America, Europe, Russia 
and China for ﬂeets with established Arctic equipment, and may 
open up access to known natural resources which have so far been 
covered by ice (Guy and Lasserre, 2016). However, whether the Arctic 
shipping routes will be a realistic alternative depends not only on 
regulatory frameworks and economic aspects (such as infrastructure 
and reliability of the routes) but also on societal trends and values, 
demographics and tourism demand (Prowse et al. 2009; Wassmann 
et al. 2010; Pelletier and Guy, 2012; George, 2013; Hodgson et al. 
2016; Pizzolato et al. 2016; Dawson, 2017) (Section 3.2.4.2, 3.4.3.3). 
Simultaneously, shipping routes through the Arctic pose additional 
risk from human impact such as pollution, introduction of invasive 
species and collision with marine mammals, and emission of short-
lived climate forcers that can amplify warming in the region and 
accelerate localised warming (Wan et al. 2016) (Section 3.5.3.2). 
Existing governance may not be sufﬁcient to limit the elevated 
risk on Arctic ecosystems and their dependent economies from 
increased shipping activities (Section 3.4.3, 3.5.3). Climate change 
may bring new economic opportunities, particularly for polar oil 
and gas development (medium conﬁdence), shipping (medium 
conﬁdence) and tourism (low conﬁdence) although realisation of 
these opportunities will pose uncertain ecological risks to sensitive 
ecosystems and biota, and the dependent human communities in the 
region (high conﬁdence). 
Ocean renewable energy provides an emerging alternative to fossil 
fuels and comprises energy extraction from offshore winds, tides, 
waves, ocean thermal gradients, currents and salinity gradients 
(Harrison and Wallace, 2005; Koetse and Rietveld, 2009; Bae et al. 
2010; Jaroszweski et  al. 2010; O Rourke et  al. 2010; Hooper and 
Austen, 2013; Kempener and Neumann, 2014b; Kempener and 
Neumann, 2014a; Abanades et al. 2015; Astariz et al. 2015; Borthwick, 
2016; Foteinis and Tsoutsos, 2017; Manasseh et al. 2017; Becker et al. 
2018; Gattuso et al. 2018; Hemer et al. 2018; Dinh and McKeogh, 
2019b; Dinh and McKeogh, 2019a). Other potential sources of 
marine renewable energy include algal biofuels (Greene et al. 2010; 
Greene et al. 2016). While such approaches offers a way to mitigate 
climate change, changes in climatic conditions (such as waves and 
winds) may impact marine renewable energy installations and their 
effectiveness (Harrison and Wallace, 2005). A more comprehensive 
assessment of these issues is expected to be provided by IPCC WGIII 
in the AR6 full report. 
Overall, some major existing ocean economy sectors such as ﬁshing, 
coastal tourism and recreation are already at risk by climate change 
(medium conﬁdence), and all sectors are expected to have elevated 
risks with high future emission scenarios (high conﬁdence). The 
emerging demand for alternative energy sources is expected to 
generate economic opportunities for the ocean renewable energy 
section (high conﬁdence), although their potential may also be 
affected by climate change (low conﬁdence).
5.4.2.5 
Impacts of Changing Ocean on Sustainable 
Development Goals
Climate change impacts will have consequences for the ability of 
human society to achieve sustainable development. SR15 concludes 
that “Limiting global warming to 1.5ºC rather than 2ºC would 
make it markedly easier to achieve many aspects of sustainable 
development, with greater potential to eradicate poverty and reduce 
inequalities (medium evidence, high agreement)”. This assessment 
focuses on how climate change impacts on marine ecosystems would 
challenge sustainable development, using the United Nations SDGs 
as a framework to discuss the linkages between those issues. 
Climate impacts on marine ecosystems affect their ability to provide 
seafood and raw materials, and to support biodiversity, habitats 
and other regulating processes (Section 5.4.1), and these impacts 
on the ocean affect people directly and indirectly (Sections 5.4.2.1, 
5.4.2.2, 5.4.2.3). SDG 14 is the goal that is most directly relevant: 
“Life below water: including indicators for marine pollution, habitat 
restoration and protected areas, ocean acidiﬁcation, ﬁsheries, and 
coastal development.” 
Climate impacts in the ocean to other SDGs are mediated through 
social and economic factors when the SDG targets are affected (Singh 
et  al. 2019). For example, climate impacts on marine ecosystem 
services related to primary industries that provide food, income and 
livelihood to people have direct implications for a range of SDGs. These 
SDGs include ‘no poverty’ (SDG 1), ‘zero hunger’ (SDG 2), ‘decent work 
and economic growth’ (SDG 8), ‘reduced inequalities’ (SDG 10) and 
‘responsible consumption and production’ (SGD 12) (Singh et al. 2019, 
Figure 5.22). These impacts relate to changing ocean under climate 
change that affect the pathways to build sustainable economies and 
eliminate poverty (Sections 5.4.2.4), eliminate hunger and achieve food 
security (Section 5.4.2.1.3), reduce inequalities (Sections 5.4.2.2) and 
519

achieve responsible consumption and production (Sections 5.4.2.3.1) 
(Carvalho et al. 2017; Castells-Quintana et al. 2017). Climate change 
is also creating living conditions in coastal areas that are less suitable 
to human settlement and changing distributions of marine disease 
vectors (Section 5.4.2.1.1, 5.4.2.3.3), reducing our chances of 
achieving the goal for good health and well-being (SDG 3) (Pearse, 
2017; Wouters et al. 2017). Women are often engaged in jobs and 
livelihood sources that are more exposed to climate change impacts 
from the ocean such as impacts on ﬁsheries (Section 5.4.2.3.1) and 
impacts of SLR on coastal regions (Chapter 4). For example, in Senegal,

women disproportionately engage in rice crop cultivation in coastal 
ﬂood plain (Linares, 2009), and are thus exposed to the risks on their 
livelihood from rising sea levels and resulting salinisation (Dennis 
et al. 1995). Flooding in Bangladesh has increased the vulnerability 
of women to harassment and abuse as the ﬂooding upends normal 
life and increases crime rates (Azad et  al. 2013). As such, climate 
change may negatively affect our ability to achieve “gender equality” 
(SDG 5) (Salehyan, 2008). Impacts on living conditions as well as 
changing recreational, aesthetic, and spiritual experiences also affect 
our ability to achieve ‘sustainable cities and communities’ (SDG 11) 
(Section 5.4.2.2.1). The consequences of climate change in the ocean 
to achieving the remaining SDGs are less clear. However, the SDGs 
are interlinked, and achieving SDG 14, and especially the targets of 
increasing economic beneﬁts to SIDS and Least Developed Countries, 
as well as eliminating illegal ﬁshing and overﬁshing, will beneﬁts 
all other SDGs (Singh et  al. 2017). The interlinkages among SDGS 
mean climate change impact on the ocean will affect all other SDGs 
beside SDG14 in various ways, some possible direct and many indirect 
(low conﬁdence). 
Overall, climate change impacts on the ocean will negatively affect 
the chance of achieving the SDGs and sustaining their beneﬁts 
(medium conﬁdence).

Risk-reduction Responses  
and their Governance
5.5.1 
Ocean-based Mitigation
5.5.1.1 
Context for Blue Carbon and Overview Assessment
There is political and scientiﬁc agreement on the need for a wide range 
of mitigation actions to avoid dangerous climate change (UNEP, 2017; 
IPCC, 2018). Opportunities to reduce emissions by the greater use of 
ocean renewable energy are identiﬁed in Section 5.4.2.3.2. Here, in 
accordance with the approved scoping of this report, the assessment 
of mitigation options is limited to the management of natural ocean 
processes, that is, requiring policy intervention, with a focus on ‘blue 
carbon’. Natural processes per se, although important to the climate 
system and the global carbon cycle, are not a mitigation response. Two 
management approaches are possible: ﬁrst, actions to maintain the 
integrity of natural carbon stores, thereby decreasing their potential 
release of greenhouse gases, whether caused by human or climate-
drivers; and second, through actions that enhance the longterm 
(century-scale) removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere by 
marine systems, primarily by biological means. 
These mitigation approaches match those proposed using terrestrial 
natural processes (Griscom et al. 2017), with extensive afforestation 
and reforestation included in all climate models that limit future 
warming to 1.5ºC (de Coninck et al. 2018). As on land, reliable carbon 
accounting is a critical consideration (Grassi et al. 2017), together with 
conﬁdence in the longterm security of carbon storage. The feasibility 
of climatically-signiﬁcant (and societally acceptable) mitigation using 
marine natural processes therefore depends on a robust quantitative 
understanding of how human actions can affect the uptake and 
release of greenhouse gases from different marine environments, 
interacting with natural biological, physical and chemical processes. 
Whilst CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas, marine ﬂuxes of 
methane and nitrous oxide can also be important, for both coastal 
regions and the open ocean (Arévalo-Martínez et al. 2015; Borges 
et al. 2016; Hamdan and Wickland, 2016).
The term ‘blue carbon’ was originally used to cover biological carbon 
in all marine ecosystems (Nellemann et  al. 2009). Subsequent 
use of the term has focused on carbon-accumulating coastal 
habitats structured by rooted plants, such as mangroves, tidal salt 
marshes and seagrass meadows, that are relatively amenable to 
management (McLeod et al. 2011; Pendleton et al. 2012; Thomas, 
2014; Macreadie et al. 2017a; Alongi, 2018; Windham-Myers et al. 
2019; Lovelock and Duarte, 2019). Comparisons across the full range 
of freshwater and saline wetland types are assisted by standardised 
approaches (Nahlik and Fennessy, 2016; Vázquez-González et  al. 
2017). Seaweeds (macroalgae) can also be considered as coastal 
blue carbon (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016; Krause-Jensen et al. 
2018; Raven, 2018), however, because of differences in their carbon 
processing, their climate mitigation potential is assessed separately 
within Section 5.5.1.2 below.
In the open ocean, the biological carbon pump is driven by the 
combination of photosynthesis by phytoplankton and downward 
transfer of particulate carbon by a variety of processes (Henson et al. 
2010; DeVries et al. 2017); it results in large-scale transfer of around 
10 GtC yr–1 carbon from near-surface waters to the ocean interior 
(Boyd et al. 2019). Most of this carbon is respired in the mesopelagic 
and contributes to the 37,000 GtC inventory of DIC, with around 
~0.1 GtC yr–1 eventually being permanently removed in deep 
sea sediments (Cartapanis et  al. 2018). In addition, the microbial 
carbon pump (Jiao et  al. 2010) produces refractory dissolved 
organic molecules throughout the water column at a rate of around 
0.4 GtC yr–1 (Jiao et al. 2014b), which due to their residence time of 
hundreds to thousands of years maintain the 700 GtC inventory of 
dissolved organic carbon in the ocean (Jiao et al. 2010; Jiao et al. 
2014a; Legendre et al. 2015; Jiao et al. 2018a). The natural removal of 
carbon by the various carbon pumps is closely balanced by upwelling 
and outgassing, with the ocean a moderate source of CO2 under 
pre-industrial conditions (Ciais et al. 2013). The mitigation potential 
of managing natural processes in the open ocean is only brieﬂy 
assessed here (Section 5.5.1.3).
Gattuso et  al. (2018) provide an overview assessment of the 
environmental, technical and societal feasibilities of using a range 
of ocean management actions to reduce climate change and its 
impacts. Their results for nine actions based on natural processes are 
summarised in Figure 5.23, also including marine renewable energy 
(wind, wave and tidal) for comparison. Eight semi-quantitative criteria 
were used to assess each action: maximum potential effectiveness by 
2100 in reducing climatic drivers (ocean warming, ocean acidiﬁcation 
and SLR), assuming full theoretical implementation; technological 
readiness and lead time to full potential effectiveness (subsequently 
combined as technical feasibility); duration of beneﬁts; co-beneﬁts; 
trade-offs (originally described as dis-beneﬁts); cost-effectiveness; 
and governability (capability of implementation, and management

Figure 5.23 |  Summary of potential beneﬁts and constraints of ocean-based risk-reduction options using natural processes, from literature-based expert assessments by 
Gattuso et al. (2018). Mitigation effectiveness was quantiﬁed relative to Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)8.5, assuming maximum theoretical implementation, 
with reduction of climate-related drivers considered at either global or local (<100 km2) scale, shown as circles or rectangles respectively. Impact reduction, co-beneﬁts 
and trade-offs are in the context of eight sensitive marine ecosystems and ecosystem services. ‘Technical issues to overcome’ is based on scores for technological readiness, 
lead time for full implementation and duration of effects. Cost is based on USD per tonne of CO2 either not released or removed from the atmosphere (for global measures) 
or per hectare of coastal area with action implemented (for local measures). ‘Governance challenges’ shows the potential difﬁculty of implementation by the international

of any associated conﬂicts). Here, governability is considered as 
a  constraint (governability challenges) reversing the scoring scale 
used by Gattuso et al. (2018).
Global measures (circles in Figure 5.23) can be regarded as mitigation, 
reducing drivers; local measures (rectangles), are primarily ecosystem-
based adaptation (EbA), reducing impacts (Section 5.5.2), although 
they may also contribute to mitigation; two actions were considered 
at both scales. Gattuso et al. (2018) did not consider the effects of 
actions on ocean oxygenation, notwithstanding the importance of 
deoxygenation as a component of climate change. Additional detail 
is given in SM5.4.
5.5.1.2 
Climate Mitigation in the Coastal Ocean 
5.5.1.2.1 Opportunities and challenges relating to coastal carbon
Estuaries, shelf seas and a wide range of other intertidal and 
shallow-water habitats (Section 5.3) play an important role in the 
global carbon cycle through their primary production by rooted 
plants, seaweeds (macroalgae) and phytoplankton, and also by 
processing riverine organic carbon. However, the natural carbon 
dynamics of these systems have been greatly changed by human 
activities (Regnier et al. 2013; Cloern et al. 2016; Day and Rybczyk, 
2019) (high conﬁdence). Direct anthropogenic impacts include 
coastal land-use change (Ramesh et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018a); indirect 
effects include increased nutrient delivery and other changes in 
river catchments (Jiao et al. 2011; Regnier et al. 2013), and marine 
resource exploitation in shelf seas (Bauer et al. 2013). There is high 
conﬁdence that these human-driven changes will continue, reﬂecting 
coastal settlement trends and global population growth (Barragán 
and de Andrés, 2015). 
Policy recognition of the mitigation beneﬁts of coastal ecosystems 
requires quantitative information on their actual and potential 
carbon uptake and storage at the local and national scale, within an 
international framework for carbon accounting (Crooks et al. 2011; 
Hejnowicz et al. 2015). Such methods are being developed for coastal 
habitats structured by rooted plants (Needelman et al. 2018; Troxler 
et  al. 2018; Needelman et  al. 2019), considered here as ‘coastal 
vegetation’, linked to protocols for veriﬁcation of longterm carbon 
removal and ﬁnancial incentives (Crooks et al. 2011; Hejnowicz et al. 
2015) and building on techniques used for managing terrestrial 
carbon sinks (Ahmed and Glaser, 2016b; Aziz et al. 2016). Proposals 
to apply carbon accounting to seaweeds, the water column and shelf 
sea sediments (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016; Zhang et al. 2017) 
are less well-developed. 
5.5.1.2.2 Coastal vegetation: mangrove, salt marsh  
and seagrass ecosystems
Mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats are widely recognised 
as blue carbon ecosystems with mitigation potential (Chmura et al. 
2003; Duarte et al. 2005; Kennedy et al. 2010; McLeod et al. 2011). 
Although covering only ~0.1% of the Earth’s surface, these three 
ecosystems together have been estimated to support 1–10% of 
global marine primary production (Duarte et al. 2017). More than 
150 countries contain at least one of these ecosystems; 71 countries 
contain all three (Herr and Landis, 2016), and 74 countries mention 
such coastal wetlands (ﬁve speciﬁcally as blue carbon) in their 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement 
(Martin et al. 2016a; Gallo et al. 2017).
These three vegetated coastal habitats are characterised by high, yet 
variable, organic carbon storage in their soils and sediments on a per 
unit area basis (high conﬁdence). In the humid tropics, mangrove 
below-ground organic carbon is typically 500–1000 tC ha–1 (Donato 
et al. 2011; Alongi and Mukhopadhyay, 2015; Howard et al. 2017), 
although only ~50 tC ha–1 in arid regions (Almahasheer et  al. 
2017). Australian salt marshes show particularly wide variation in 
organic carbon storage, ranging from 15–1000 tC ha–1 (top 1 m) 
with mean of 165 tC ha–1 (Kelleway et al. 2016; Macreadie et al. 
2017b). For seagrass meadows, storage values are typically 
400–1600 tC ha–1 but can exceed 2000 tC ha–1 (Serrano et al. 2014). 
These accumulations have occurred over decadal to millennial time 
scales (McKee et al. 2007; Lo Iacono et al. 2008). Such blue carbon 
stock values are similar to freshwater wetlands and peat, but higher 
than for most forest soils (Laffoley and Grimsditch, 2009; Pan et al. 
2011) (high conﬁdence). 
When vegetated coastal ecosystems are disturbed, a proportion of 
their stored carbon is released back to the atmosphere, along with 
other greenhouse gases (Marba and Duarte, 2009; Duarte et al. 2010; 
Pendleton et al. 2012; Lovelock et al. 2017). Globally, around 25–50% 
of vegetated coastal habitats have already been lost or degraded 
due to coastal agricultural developments, urbanisation and other 
human disturbance during the past 100 years (McLeod et al. 2011). 
The highest historical losses (60–90%) have occurred in Europe and 
China (Jickells et al. 2015; Gu et al. 2018; Li et al. 2018a). Current 
losses are estimated at 0.2–3.0%  yr–1, depending on vegetation 
type and location (FAO et al. 2014; Alongi and Mukhopadhyay, 2015; 
Atwood et al. 2017) (medium conﬁdence). Associated global carbon 
emissions are estimated at 0.04–0.28  GtC  yr–1  (Pendleton et  al. 
2012); 0.06–0.61 GtC yr–1 (Howard et al. 2017); 0.10–1.46 GtC yr–1 
(Lovelock et al. 2017); and 0.007 GtC yr–1 (mangroves only) (Taillardat 
et al. 2018). This range of values reﬂects uncertainties regarding the 
global rate of habitat loss, and the proportion of carbon remineralised 
to CO2.
Mitigation through emission reduction can therefore be achieved by 
habitat protection, to greatly reduce or end the human-driven loss 
of mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass ecosystems. Such action could 
potentially produce nationally-signiﬁcant mitigation (>1% of fossil 
fuel emissions) for several countries (Taillardat et al. 2018). However, 
there are still many uncertainties in quantifying carbon release due 
to habitat degradation and loss (Lovelock et al. 2017), and hence in 
determining emission reductions. Furthermore, this mitigation option 
is not available to those countries where habitat loss is not currently 
occurring, for example, in Bangladesh (Taillardat et al. 2018). Since 
legal structures already exist in many countries to protect coastal 
wetlands, the main policy need may be the enforcement of national 
regulation and site-speciﬁc MPAs (Miteva et  al. 2015; Herr et  al. 
2017; Howard et al. 2017).
523

The alternative mitigation approach using coastal blue carbon 
ecosystems is to enhance the natural carbon uptake of such habitats, 
not only by increasing their spatial coverage through habitat 
restoration and new habitat creation, but also by taking management 
measures to maximise the carbon uptake and storage for existing 
coastal ecosystems. Such measures include reducing anthropogenic 
nutrient inputs and other pollutants; restoring hydrology, by removing 
barriers to tidal ﬂow and sediment delivery; and reinstating predators 
(to reduce carbon loss caused by some bioturbators) (Macreadie et al. 
2017a). Per unit area of habitat created, restored or rehabilitated, 
such actions may offer high rates of carbon removal: widely-quoted 
values are 226 ± 39 gC m–1 yr–1 for mangroves, 218 ± 24 gC m–1 yr–1 
for salt marsh and 138 ± 38 gC m–1 yr–1 for seagrass ecosystems 
(McLeod et al. 2011; Isensee et al. 2019). 
Around 90 restoration and rehabilitation projects for mangroves 
have been documented (López-Portillo et al. 2017), with associated 
development of a range of restoration evaluation methods (Zhao 
et  al. 2016a). Salt marsh restoration is reviewed by Adam (2019) 
and seagrass restoration by van Katwijk et  al. (2016). Consistent 
conclusions, supported by other studies (Bayraktarov et al. 2016; Wylie 
et al. 2016) are that: natural regeneration increases the likelihood 
of longterm survival; higher success rates are achieved with strong 
stakeholder engagement; and it is critical that the (human) factors 
causing original loss and degradation have been properly addressed 
(high conﬁdence).
Quantiﬁcation of the climatic beneﬁts of such actions is, however, 
not straightforward. Measurements of carbon burial rates show high 
site-speciﬁc variability, being strongly affected by a wide range of 
environmental factors for mangroves (Adame et al. 2017; Schile et al. 
2017), seagrasses (Lavery et al. 2013) and salt marshes (Kelleway 
et al. 2017b). The reliable determination of sediment accumulation 
rates is a key consideration, with associated uncertainties not fully 
reﬂected in the McLeod et  al. (2011) estimates given above. In 
particular, geochemical-based studies have indicated that seagrass 
carbon burial may have been greatly overestimated (Johannessen 
and Macdonald, 2016). These issues are contentious (Johannessen 
and Macdonald, 2018a; Johannessen and Macdonald, 2018b; 
Macreadie et al. 2018; Oreska et al. 2018); their scientiﬁc resolution 
is highly desirable. Additional complexities relating to the mitigation 
role of coastal blue carbon ecosystems include the following:
• Emissions of other greenhouse gases also need to be taken 
into account (Keller, 2019b). Methane release from mangrove 
habitats can reduce the scale of their climatic beneﬁts by 
18–22% (Adams et al. 2012; Chen and Ganapin, 2016; Chmura 
et al. 2016; Rosentreter et al. 2018; Cameron et al. 2019) and 
nitrous oxide and methane together may offset salt marsh CO2 
uptake by 24–31% (Adams et al. 2012). Nitrous oxide emissions 
are strongly affected by nutrient loading (Chmura et al. 2016); 
under pristine conditions, mangroves can provide a sink rather 
than a source (Maher et al. 2016). Note that values of the ‘offset’ 
depend on the metrics used for determining CO2 equivalents.
• Carbonate formation, releasing CO2, may also reduce the beneﬁts 
of carbon storage by similar proportions (Howard et  al. 2017; 
Macreadie et al. 2017a; Kennedy et al. 2018; Saderne et al. 2019).
• Lateral transfers are not well-quantiﬁed. Whilst some of the 
carbon stored in coastal marine sediments may be recalcitrant 
carbon from terrestrial or atmospheric sources (and should 
therefore be excluded) (Chew and Gallagher, 2018), export of 
dissolved organic carbon, inorganic carbon and alkalinity may be 
considered as additional sequestration (Maher et al. 2018; Santos 
et al. 2019). 
• The permanence of vegetated coastal systems, even if well-
protected, cannot be assumed under future temperature regimes 
(Ward et  al. 2016; Duke et  al. 2017; Jennerjahn et  al. 2017; 
Nowicki et al. 2017).
• Responses to future SLR are also uncertain and complex (Kirwan 
and Megonigal, 2013; Spencer et  al. 2016). However, impacts 
are not necessarily negative: carbon sequestration capacity may 
increase where totally new habitats are created (Barnes, 2017), 
or if mangroves replace salt marshes (Kelleway et al. 2016). 
In summary, a combination of both conservation and restoration 
of mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitats can contribute to 
national mitigation effort for those countries with relatively large 
coastlines where such ecosystems naturally occur (Murdiyarso 
et  al. 2015; Atwood et  al. 2017). However, the associated current 
uncertainties in quantifying relevant carbon storage and ﬂows are 
expected to be problematic for reliable measurement, reporting and 
veriﬁcation (high conﬁdence).
At the global scale, synthesis studies have estimated the potential 
additional sequestration achieved by cost effective coastal blue carbon 
restoration as ~0.05 GtC yr–1 (Griscom et al. 2017) and 0.04 GtC yr–1 
(National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019), 
assuming that a relatively high proportion of vegetated ecosystems 
can be re-instated to their 1980–1990 extents. These values compare to 
current net anthropogenic emissions from all sources of 10.0 GtC yr–1 
(Le Quéré et al. 2018), and are consistent with the ‘very low’ scores by 
(Gattuso et al. 2018) for the climate mitigation beneﬁts of conserving 
and restoring coastal vegetation (Figure 5.23). Coastal ecosystem 
restoration could theoretically achieve higher sequestration, around 
~0.2 GtC yr–1 (Griscom et  al. 2017), but would be challenging, 
because of the semi-permanent and on-going nature of most coastal 
land-use change, such as human settlement, conversion to agriculture 
and aquaculture, shoreline hardening and port development (Gittman 
et al. 2015; Li et al. 2018a). 
Restoration costs could also be an important constraint for large-scale 
application. Based on published data from 246 observations, 
Bayraktarov et al. (2016) estimated median total costs for restoration 
of one hectare of mangrove, salt marsh and seagrass habitat to be 
~2,508, 151,129 and 383,672 respectively, in 2010 USD. For each 
ecosystem, there was high variability in costs according to the economy 
of the country where the restoration projects were carried out, and the 
restoration technique applied. Assessment of coastal conservation and 
restoration costs is also given in Section 4.4.2.3, in Box 5.5 (in the 
context of coral reef restoration costs) and Section 5.5.2.5. 
Measures to protect and restore coastal blue carbon habitats provide 
many other societal beneﬁts in addition to climate regulation 
(Section 5.4.1). In particular, there is high conﬁdence that coastal 
524

5
wetlands beneﬁt local ﬁsheries, enhance biodiversity, give storm 
protection, reduce coastal erosion, improve water quality and support 
local livelihoods (Costanza et al. 2008; Spalding et al. 2014). Coastal 
ecosystems may keep pace with sufﬁciently gradual SLR, and may 
be more cost-effective in ﬂood protection than hard infrastructure 
like seawalls (Temmerman et al. 2013; Möller, 2019). Coastal blue 
carbon can therefore be considered as a ‘no regrets’ mitigation 
option at the national level in many countries, in addition to (not 
a replacement for) more effective mitigation measures. Additional 
research is needed over the full range of environmental conditions 
to improve knowledge and understanding of the complex carbon 
dynamics of coastal vegetation and associated systems, to enable 
well-quantiﬁed and cost-effective carbon sequestration enhancement 
(Vázquez-González et al. 2017; Windham-Myers et al. 2019).
5.5.1.2.3 Seaweeds (macroalgae) 
Seaweeds do not directly transfer carbon to marine sediments, unlike 
the rooted coastal vegetation considered above (Howard et al. 2017). 
Nevertheless, seaweed detritus can deliver carbon to sedimentary 
sites (Hill et al. 2015) and may provide a source of refractory dissolved 
organic (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016). Recent studies indicate 
that globally important amounts of carbon may be involved in these 
processes (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016; Krause-Jensen et  al. 
2018; Smale et al. 2018). There is, however, currently low conﬁdence 
that enhancement of natural seaweed production can provide 
a signiﬁcant mitigation response, due to large uncertainties relating 
to sequestration duration and effectiveness. Such considerations 
relate to transport pathways, the fate of material transported to 
deeper water, and the timescales of its subsequent return to the 
atmosphere over decadal to century timescales. 
Seaweed aquaculture is inherently more manageable as a mitigation 
response (N‘Yeurt et al. 2012; Chung et al. 2013; Chung et al. 2017; 
Duarte et al. 2017). If linked to biofuel or biogas production (N‘Yeurt 
and Iese, 2014; Moreira and Pires, 2016; Sondak et al. 2017), there 
would be potential to reduce emissions (as an alternative to fossil 
fuels); if also linked to carbon capture and storage (Hughes et al. 
2012), it may be possible to achieve negative emissions (net CO2 
removal from the atmosphere). Full life cycle analyses are needed 
to assess the energy efﬁciency of such approaches, and the viability 
of scaling them up to climatically-important levels, taking account 
of associated environmental and socioeconomic implications.
A different mitigation option using seaweeds relates to their use as 
a dietary supplement for ruminants to suppress methane production. 
In vitro studies have given promising results (Dubois et  al. 2013; 
Machado et al. 2016; Machado et al. 2018). However, because the 
potential scale of real-world beneﬁts have yet to be quantiﬁed, there 
is low conﬁdence in this approach as a mitigation option. 
5.5.1.2.4 Land-sea integrated eco-engineering
Land-based nutrient management could, in theory, be used to enhance 
carbon storage in coastal seas and deeper waters, by increasing the 
amount of refractory dissolved organic carbon (Jiao et al. 2011; Jiao 
et al. 2014b; Jiao et al. 2018b). This idea is supported by a statistical 
analysis of the relationship between organic carbon and nitrate in 
various natural environments (Taylor and Townsend, 2010) as well as 
by experimental results in estuarine and offshore waters (Yuan et al. 
2010; Jiao et al. 2011; Jiao et al. 2014b). Delivery of nutrients from 
agricultural fertilisers and sewage discharge to coastal waters may 
currently promote the microbial breakdown of river-derived terrestrial 
dissolved organic carbon, reducing carbon storage (Liu et al. 2014). 
Thus reducing nutrient inputs in the future may expand carbon storage 
by favouring the microbial carbon pump, in addition to the multiple 
co-beneﬁts of reduced nutrient loads related to HABs, oxygenation 
and ocean acidiﬁcation (Miranda et al. 2013; Jiao et al. 2018a; Zhang 
et  al. 2018). Although there is some evidence for the impact of 
dissolved organic carbon variations on global scale climate (Rothman 
et al. 2003) the beneﬁts of this approach have yet to be determined 
quantitatively and uncertainties remain regarding the longevity of 
removal and associated carbon accounting (measurement, reporting 
and veriﬁcation). Until such issues are better resolved, there is low 
conﬁdence that stimulation of refractory dissolved organic carbon 
production could provide an operational long-term mitigation measure.
5.5.1.2.5 Control of sediment disturbance, enhanced weathering 
and other geochemical approaches 
Anthropogenic sediment disturbance, through ﬁshing, dredging and 
the installation of offshore structures, affects the security of carbon 
storage in shelf sea sediments (Hale et al. 2017). Management of 
such activities might therefore increase carbon retention, over 
relatively large areas of shelf seas (Avelar et al. 2017; Luisetti et al. 
2019). However, there is a lack of data and understanding of the 
complex processes that affect carbon storage in the potentially 
mobile fraction of marine sediments (van de Velde et  al. 2018); 
exceptions are provided by Hu et al. (2016) and Diesing et al. (2017). 
Due to these uncertainties, there is currently low conﬁdence that 
control of sediment disturbance can be used for climate mitigation.
There is theoretically greater potential for carbon removal by 
‘enhanced weathering’ using mineral additions to coastal waters 
(and the open ocean) (Rau, 2011; Renforth and Henderson, 2017). 
These approaches are based on increasing the naturally-occurring 
uptake of CO2 by carbonates (e.g., calcite and dolomite) or silicate 
minerals (such as olivine). Such rock-weathering currently sequesters 
~0.25 GtC yr–1, on land and at sea (Taylor et al. 2015) and provides 
the longterm control of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It could be 
enhanced by adding ground minerals to beaches (Montserrat et al. 
2017) or the sea surface. Other geochemical approaches for adding 
alkalinity that are less directly based on natural processes (Rau et al. 
2012; GESAMP, 2019) are not considered here.
Enhanced weathering methods might be used to reduce local 
impacts, for example, for coral reefs (Albright et al. 2016b; Feng et al. 
2016), as well as contributing to wider mitigation of climate change. 
However, their climatic beneﬁts would be difﬁcult to quantify, with 
other constraints on their development and deployment relating 
to the governance, cost and uncertain environmental impacts of 
large-scale application (Gattuso et  al. 2018). The combination of 
these factors results in low conﬁdence that enhanced weathering can 
provide a viable and acceptable climate mitigation approach.

5.5.1.3 
Climate Mitigation in the Open Ocean
Recent reviews of the scope for using natural processes in the open 
ocean for climate mitigation are provided by Keller (2019a) and 
GESAMP (2019). The summary assessment given here is limited to 
direct and indirect biologically-based approaches, consistent with 
the scoping of this report and the major governance constraints on 
the large-scale application of open ocean interventions. 
Current NPP by marine phytoplankton is estimated to be 
58 ± 7 GtC yr–1 (Legendre et al. 2015), similar to terrestrial primary 
production and around 6 times greater than anthropogenic emissions 
(Le Quere et  al. (2016). However, over 99% of the biologically-
ﬁxed carbon returns to the atmosphere over a range of timescales 
(Cartapanis et al. 2018).
The direct method of increasing marine productivity involves adding 
land-derived nutrients that may currently limit primary production, 
particularly iron. This approach has been investigated experimentally, 
by modelling and by observations of natural system behaviour 
(Keller et al. 2014a; Bowie et al. 2015; Tagliabue et al. 2017). The 
13 experimental studies to date (seven in the Southern Ocean, ﬁve 
in the Paciﬁc, and one in the sub-tropical Atlantic) have shown 
that primary production can be, but is not always, enhanced by the 
addition of iron (Boyd et al. 2007; Yoon et al. 2016; GESAMP, 2019). 
The difﬁculties arise in demonstrating the time-scale of additional 
carbon removal, and in obtaining information on the consequences 
of the fertilisation for other marine ecosystem components, including 
ocean acidiﬁcation and other potential side-effects (Williamson and 
Turley, 2012). Modelling studies (Aumont and Bopp, 2006) indicate 
that the climatic beneﬁts could be relatively short-lived. Furthermore, 
public and political acceptability for ocean fertilisation is low 
(Williamson et  al. 2012; Boyd and Bressac, 2016; Williamson and 
Bodle, 2016; Fuentes-George, 2017; McGee et al. 2018). Ocean iron 
fertilisation is regulated by the London Protocol, with amendments 
prohibiting such action unless constituting legitimate scientiﬁc 
research authorised under permit (see Section 5.5.4.1). There are 
additional governance constraints for the Southern Ocean where 
ocean iron fertilisation is theoretically considered to be most effective 
(Robinson et al. 2014).
Open ocean fertilisation by macro-nutrients (e.g.,  nitrate) has 
also been proposed, with modelled potential for gigaton-scale 
carbon removal (Harrison, 2017). Similar technical and governance 
considerations apply with regard to the quantiﬁcation of mitigation 
beneﬁts, the monitoring of potential adverse impacts, and the 
political acceptability of large-scale deployment. This approach would 
also involve higher costs, because of the much greater quantities of 
nutrients required (Williamson and Turley, 2012).
The indirect method of enhancing marine productivity uses physical 
devices to increase upwelling, thereby increasing the supply of 
a wide range of naturally-occurring nutrients from deeper water. 
This technique risks releasing additional CO2 to the atmosphere, 
reducing its potential for climate mitigation (Bauman et al. 2014). 
There may also be other undesirable climatic consequences, including 
disruption of regional weather patterns and long-term warming 
rather than cooling, if enhanced upwelling is deployed at large scale 
(Kwiatkowski et al. 2015).
Because of the many technical, environmental and governance 
issues relating to marine productivity enhancement, by either direct 
fertilisation or upwelling, there is low conﬁdence that such open 
ocean manipulations provide a viable mitigation measure.
5.5.2 
Ocean-based Adaptation
The AR5 concluded, with high agreement but limited evidence, 
that climate change impacts on coastal human settlements and 
communities could be reduced through coastal adaptation activities 
(Wong et  al. 2014a). The limited evidence of the context-speciﬁc 
application of adaptation principles to support the assessment was 
highlighted as a knowledge gap for future research. This assessment 
reports progress made with developing such evidence and assesses 
human adaptation response to climate change in ecosystems, coastal 
communities and marine environments. 
Components of human adaptation responses include risk assessment, 
risk reduction, and pathways towards resilience (Cross-Chapter Box 2; 
Chapter 1.6). Residual risk remains where hazard, vulnerability and 
exposure intersect, subsequent to an adaptation pathway response. 
Here we focus on adaptation responses within ecosystems and in 
human systems, as framed in Chapter 1, and deﬁned by: 
• Nature-based or ecosystem-based adaptation (5.5.2.1). The 
use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall 
adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to the adverse 
effects of climate change. EbA uses the range of opportunities 
for the sustainable management, conservation, and restoration of 
ecosystems to provide services that enable people to adapt to the 
impacts of climate change (Narayan et al. 2016; Moosavi, 2017).
• Human systems – Built environment adaptation (5.5.2.3.1) 
Adaptation solutions pertaining to coastal built infrastructure 
and the systems that support such infrastructure (Mutombo and 
Ölçer, 2016; Forzieri et al. 2018).
• Human systems – Socioinstitutional adaptation (5.5.2.3) 
Adaptation responses within human social, governance and 
economic systems and sectors (Oswald Beiler et al. 2016; Thorne 
et  al. 2017). This includes, but is not limited to community-
based adaptation by coastal communities (5.5.2.3.2) based on 
empowering and promoting the adaptive capacity of communities, 
through appropriate use of context, culture, knowledge, 
agency, and community preferences (Archer  et  al.  2014; 
Shafﬁril et al. 2017).
To avoid duplication, detailed consideration of adaptation responses 
to SLR and extreme events (including heat waves, and compound and 
cascading events) are avoided here, as they are covered by Chapter 4 
and Chapter 6, respectively. Tables 5.7 and 5.8 provide a summary 
assessment of climate change impacts, human adaptation response 
and beneﬁts in ecosystems and human systems respectively. Details 
of the assessed literature are in SM Table 5.7. Climate drivers and

impacts reported in the adaptation literature are consistent with 
those reported in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. Physical impacts include the 
disruption of physical coastal processes, like sediment dynamics, 
leading to, for example, erosion, ﬂooding and coastal infrastructure 
damage (see Tables 5.7 and 5.8). Ecological impacts include the loss 
of ecosystems and biodiversity (Sections 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.3), which 
affected provision of ecosystem services, like coastal protection or 
food provision. The most commonly reported non-climate human 
drivers are growing human coastal populations (Elliff and Silva, 2017; 
van Oppen et al. 2017a; Gattuso et al. 2018) with poorly planned or 
managed urban development (Barbier, 2015; Wigand et al. 2017), land 
use change (Robins et al. 2016), loss of ecosystems (Runting et al. 
2017), socioeconomic vulnerability (Broto et al. 2015; Bennett et al. 
2016) of many coastal communities, ineffective governance and 
knowledge gaps for implementation.
5.5.2.1 
Ecosystem-based Adaptation
This section assesses adaptation response in coastal ecosystems, 
beginning with biological adaptation in species, and followed by 
a summary assessment of EbA as a response to climate change. 
5.5.2.1.1 Biological adaptation 
There are many studies on biological climate change adaptation 
responses (Crozier and Hutchings, 2014; Miller et al. 2017; Diamond, 
2018). Sections 5.2.3 and 5.3.3 discuss three main types of biological 
adaptation, broadly deﬁned: evolutionary (genetic) adaptation 
through natural selection; phenotypic plasticity (acclimatisation), 
within an organism’s lifetime; and individual or population mobility 
towards more favourable conditions. There are, however, expected to 
be limits to such natural adaptation, and large variations between 
species and populations (Gienapp and Merilä, 2018). 
An accurate understanding of climate change impacts upon species, 
their sensitivity and adaptive capacity and consequent ecological 
effects (considering both indirect as well as direct impacts) is used 
to estimate extinction risk, so that an appropriate management 
response can be developed (Butt et  al. 2016). EbA takes these 
complex interactions into account (Hobday et al. 2015), including the 
disruptive impacts of alien invasive species (Ondiviela et al. 2014; 
Wigand et al. 2017). Effective adaptation action, therefore, contains 
a broader consideration than historical conservation practices 
(medium evidence, high agreement), including the development of 
international collaborations and databases to improve ocean-scale 
understanding of climate change impacts (Okey et al. 2014; Young 
et al. 2015). A key knowledge gap relates to the critical thresholds for 
irreversible change for species (Powell et al. 2017).
5.5.2.1.2 Adaptation in coral reefs
Coral reefs are currently threatened by the continuous global 
degradation of warm water coral reef ecosystems and the failure of 
traditional conservation actions to revive most of the degrading reefs 
(Rinkevich, 2008; Miller and Russ, 2014). Interventions to rehabilitate 
degraded coral reef ecosystems can be categorised as preventive 
(‘passive’ restoration) or adaptive (‘active’ restoration) (Miller and 
Russ, 2014; Linden and Rinkevich, 2017) (see Box 5.5). 
Inspired by silviculture (forestation) approaches to terrestrial 
ecosystem restoration, studies (Rinkevich, 1995; Rinkevich, 2005; 
Rinkevich, 2006; Rinkevich, 2008; Bongiorni et  al. 2011) have 
proposed a two step restoration strategy for warm water coral reefs 
termed gardening of denuded coral reefs. In the ﬁrst step, a large 
pool of coral colonies (derived from coral nubbins and fragments, 
and from sexually derived spat) are farmed in underwater nurseries, 
preferably on mid-water ﬂoating devices installed in sheltered 
zones, in which coral material can be cultured for up to several 
years. In the second step, nursery-grown coral colonies, together 
with recruited associated biota, are transplanted to degraded reef 
sites (Shaﬁr and Rinkevich, 2008; Mbije et al. 2010; Shaish et al. 
2010b; Shaish et  al. 2010a; Bongiorni et  al. 2011; Horoszowski-
Fridman et al. 2011; Linden and Rinkevich, 2011; Mbije et al. 2013; 
Cruz et al. 2014; Chavanich et al. 2015; Horoszowski-Fridman et al. 
2015; Lirman and Schopmeyer, 2016; Montoya Maya et al. 2016; Ng 
et al. 2016; Lohr and Patterson, 2017; Rachmilovitz and Rinkevich, 
2017). Active restoration of coral reefs, while still in its infancy 
and facing a variety of challenges (Rinkevich, 2015b; Hein et al. 
2017), has been suggested to potentially improve the ecological 
status of degraded coral reefs and the socioeconomic beneﬁts that 
the reefs provide (Rinkevich, 2014; Rinkevich, 2015b; Linden and 
Rinkevich, 2017). 
Ecological engineering approaches may promote coral reef 
adaptation (Rinkevich, 2014; Forsman et al. 2015; Coelho et al. 2017; 
Horoszowski-Fridman and Rinkevich, 2017; Linden and Rinkevich, 
2017; Rachmilovitz and Rinkevich, 2017). They also include: 
augmenting functional diversity, including that of the microbiome 
(Casey et  al. 2015; Horoszowski-Fridman and Rinkevich, 2017; 
Shaver and Silliman, 2017); transplantating whole habitats 
(Shaish et al. 2010b; Gómez et al. 2014); and enhancing genetic 
diversity (Iwao et al. 2014; Drury et al. 2016; Horoszowski-Fridman 
and Rinkevich, 2017). Active restoration can contribute to reef 
rehabilitation in all major reef regions (Rinkevich, 2014; Rinkevich, 
2015b). However, there is limited evidence on how resistant 
these manipulated corals are to global change drivers (Shaish 
et al. 2010b; Shaish et al. 2010a) or how the nursery time affects 
biological traits like reproduction in coral transplants (Horoszowski-
Fridman et  al. 2011). Coral epigenetics may also be used as an 
adaptive management tool for reef rehabilitation (low conﬁdence), 
as suggested by studies on coral adaptation (Brown et al. 2002; 
Horoszowski-Fridman et al. 2011; Palumbi et al. 2014; Putnam and 
Gates, 2015; Putnam et al. 2016). 
Research on active coral reef restoration (Box 5.5) suggests the 
potential to help rehabilitate degraded coral reefs, provided that the 
underlying drivers of the impacts are mitigated (high conﬁdence). 
Ongoing and new research in active coral reef restoration may 
further improve active reef restoration outcomes (Box 5.5) (low 
conﬁdence). However, these coral reef restoration options may be 
ineffectual if global warming exceeds 1.5ºC relative to pre-industrial 
levels (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; IPCC, 2018).

Box 5.5 |  Coral Reef Restoration as Ocean-based Adaptation
Anthropogenic global change is impacting all warm water corals and the reef structures (Section 5.2.2.3.3; IPCC 5th Assessment 
Report (AR5)). These impacts are rapidly increasing in scale and intensity, exposing coral reefs to enhanced degradation rates and 
diminishing capacities to maintain ecological resilience, to absorb disturbances, and to adapt to the changes (Box 5.1) (Graham et al. 
2014; Rinkevich, 2015a; Harborne et al. 2017). With the growing awareness that traditional reef conservation measures are insufﬁcient to 
address climate change impacts on coral reefs (Section 5.2.2.1), adaptation interventions to enhance the resilience of coral reefs are 
being called for (Rinkevich, 1995; Rinkevich, 2000; Barton et al. 2017). Intervention strategies that are still at the ‘proof-of-concept’ stage, 
include: ‘assisted colonisation’ – actively moving species that are conﬁned to disappearing habitats (Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 2008; 
Chauvenet et al. 2013); ‘assisted evolution’ – developing corals resistant to climate change via accelerated natural evolution processes 
(van Oppen et al. 2015); assisted coral chimerism (Rinkevich, 2019); novel coral symbiont associations (McIlroy and Coffroth, 2017); and 
coral microbiome manipulation (Bourne et al. 2016; Sweet and Bulling, 2017; van Oppen et al. 2017b). In contrast, the ‘coral gardening’ 
approachs – coral farmed in nurseries and transplanted using a range of tactics to increase survivability, growth rates and reproduction 
(Rinkevich, 2006; Rinkevich, 2014) – is already in use. Other interventions that have already been implemented in some coral reefs, 
such as the use of artiﬁcial reefs (Ng et al. 2017) are limited in impacts, and all are also revealing considerable challenges (Riegl et al. 2011; 
Coles and Riegl, 2013; Ferrario et al. 2014). 
Box 5.5, Figure 1 |  Coral reef restoration as an ocean-based adaptation tool to climate change. The squiggly line represents non-linear ecological statuses along 
a trajectory and ﬁve reef states (circles 1–5; in varying ecological complexity [x-axis] and service levels [y-axis]) including two extreme statuses (a pristine versus a highly 
degraded state, circles 5 and 1, respectively). Two ‘restored reef-state’ scenarios (circles 2, 3), lead to the state of the restored ‘reef of tomorrow’ (circle 4). The route from 
the state of the ‘reef of tomorrow’ (circle 4) to a pristine state (circle 5) is doubtful (the question mark) and is still at a theoretical level. The routes from the two ‘restored 
reef-state’ scenarios to the ‘reef of tomorrow’ are under investigations (the question marks). Based on Rinkevich (2014) (Figure 1). A–C represent different reef statuses. 
A = a denuded knoll at the Dekel Beach, Eilat, Israel before reef transplantation (November 2005; Photo: Y. Horoszowski-Fridman); B = the same knoll, restored (June 2016; 
photo by Shai Shaﬁr). More than 300 nursery-grown colonies of 7 coral species were transplanted during three successive transplantations (years 2005, 2007, 2009). In 
2016 the knoll was surrounded by reef inhabiting schools of ﬁsh. C = a pristine reef, not existing under current and anticipated reef conditions. Restoration scenarios are 
developed along paths from a degraded reef (low ecological complexity, minimal reef services) toward a healthy ‘reef of tomorrow’, passing through two restored reef 
states that are impacted by climate change (Shaish et al. 2010a; Schopmeyer et al. 2012; Hernández-Delgado et al. 2014; Rinkevich, 2015a). The employment of ecological 
engineering approaches may help in moving the ecological states from either restored reef to the ‘reef of tomorrow’ status (medium conﬁdence).

Box 5.5 (continued)
Many of the alternative interventions that aim to increase the climate resilience of coral reefs involve culturing, selectively breeding 
and transplanting corals to enhance the adaptability of reef organisms to climate change, for example, by supporting the natural 
poleward range expansion of corals (West et al. 2017; Vergés et al. 2019). Advances in reef restoration techniques have been made 
in the last two decades (Rinkevich, 2014; Lirman and Schopmeyer, 2016), but assessments of the effectiveness of these techniques 
have mostly focused on the short-term feasibility of the technique (Frias-Torres and van de Geer, 2015; Lirman and Schopmeyer, 2016; 
Montoya Maya et al. 2016; Jacob et al. 2017; Rachmilovitz and Rinkevich, 2017), while longer-term evaluation in the context of all the 
pillars of sustainable development (Section 5.4.2) is limited (Rinkevich, 2015b; Barton et al. 2017; Flores et al. 2017; Hein et al. 2017). 
These alternative interventions, primarily the coral gardening approach, face two challenges. The ﬁrst is scaling up; currently, these 
interventions have been tested at scales of hundreds of meters, while application at larger scale is lacking (Rinkevich, 2014). The second 
challenge (Box 5.5, Figure 1) is the effectiveness of active reef restoration to mitigate or rehabilitate global change impacts (Shaish et al. 
2010a; Schopmeyer et al. 2012; Coles and Riegl, 2013; Hernández-Delgado et al. 2014; Rinkevich, 2015a; Wilson and Forsyth, 2018) and 
whether it can keep up with rising sea levels (Perry et al. 2018), especially in low-lying ocean states. 
Altogether, coral reefs of the future will not resemble those of today because of the projected decline and changes in the composition 
of corals and associated species in the remaining reefs (Section 5.3.4, Box 5.5 Figure 1) (Rinkevich, 2008; Ban et al. 2014) (high 
conﬁdence). The very high vulnerability of coral reefs to warming, ocean acidiﬁcation, increasing storm intensity and SLR under climate 
change (AR5 WG2), including enhanced bioerosion (Schönberg et al. 2017) (high conﬁdence) point to the importance of considering 
both mitigation (Section 5.5.1) and adaptation (Section 5.3.3.6) for coral reefs. Extensive research has explored adaptation measures 
involving the cultivation and transplantation of corals; however, the literature contains limited evidence on the comprehensive analysis 
of the relative costs and beneﬁts of these interventions across the economic, ecological, social and cultural dimensions (Bayraktarov et al. 
2016; Flores et al. 2017; Linden and Rinkevich, 2017).
5.5.2.1.3 Adaptation in mangroves and other coastal ecosystems
Mangroves provide signiﬁcant ecosystem services, including localised 
coastal protection from extreme storm events (Section 5.4.1), 
supporting services through increased sedimentation rates (Hayden 
and Granek, 2015) and provisioning services for local communities, 
for example, habitats for nurseries to support ﬁsheries. Mangroves 
provide limited carbon mitigation, in terms of global emissions 
reduction, and substantial job creation (Table 5.7) co-beneﬁts (for 
example through Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation programmes) when managed properly (Section 5.4.1, 
5.5.1.1), and there is evidence of their value in supporting 
aquaculture and ﬁshery initiatives (Huxham et al. 2015; Ahmed and 
Glaser, 2016a). 
Mangrove EbA responses most commonly reported included ecosystem 
restoration (Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz, 2015; Romañach et al. 
2018) and management such as mangroves re-planting through 
community participation programmes (Nanlohy et al. 2015; Nguyen 
et al. 2017; Triyanti et al. 2017). Mangrove EbA has been reported to 
provide multiple co-beneﬁts in terms of improvement in support for 
coastal physical processes, including: shoreline stabilisation (Hayden 
and Granek, 2015; Nanlohy et  al. 2015); ecological functioning 
(Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz, 2015; Miller et  al. 2017) with 
improved ecosystem services (Alongi, 2015; Nanlohy et  al. 2015; 
Palacios and Cantera, 2017); carbon mitigation (5.5.1.1); supporting 
livelihoods (Nanlohy et al. 2015; Nguyen et al. 2017); and reductions 
in coastal infrastructure damage and community vulnerability to 
climate change impacts. Managed retreat to counter coastal squeeze 
(Section 5.3) through improved governance, creation of ﬁnance and 
land use planning can allow mangroves to move up the shoreline 
contour or down the latitudinal gradient (Sierra-Correa and Cantera 
Kintz, 2015; Ward et  al. 2016; Romañach et  al. 2018). Therefore, 
mangrove EbA responses can strengthen coastal ecosystem services 
through shoreline stabilisation and provide multiple co-beneﬁts 
for coastal communities, like job creation and improved access to 
ecosystem services (high conﬁdence).
There are, however, examples where community mangrove 
restoration projects have resulted in maladaptive outcomes, in 
which the resulting ecosystem degradation could not provide the 
ecosystem services required (Nguyen et al. 2017; Romañach et al. 
2018). Such maladaptation can be a result of poor governance 
processes or a lack of community compliance with restoration 
plans. These examples emphasise the value of designing effective 
governance to implement adaptation responses with broad 
community participation to improve the climate risk reduction 
outcomes and co-beneﬁts (Sierra-Correa and Cantera Kintz, 2015; 
Nguyen et al. 2017) (medium evidence, high agreement).
Mangrove and other coastal ecosystems restoration and management 
can be applied through reducing non-climatic hazards (Gilman et al. 
2008; Ataur Rahman and Rahman, 2015; Sierra-Correa and Cantera 
Kintz, 2015; Ahmed and Glaser, 2016a; Nguyen et al. 2017; Romañach 
et al. 2018). Coastal and catchment development, including wetland 
transformation and degradation (Miloshis and Fairﬁeld, 2015; 
Schaeffer-Novelli et al. 2016; Watson et al. 2017a; Schuerch et al. 
2018), the disruption of physical processes impacting sedimentation 
rates (Watson et al. 2017a) and coastal squeeze compound coastal 
climate change impacts like erosion, ﬂooding and saltwater intrusion 
(Ondiviela et al. 2014; Miloshis and Fairﬁeld, 2015; Schaeffer-Novelli 
et al. 2016; Wigand et al. 2017) (Section 5.3). This reduces the ability 
531
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5

of these ecosystems to provide protection from wave and storm 
impacts, whilst positive feedbacks may occur that cause a net release 
of carbon into the atmosphere, for example, in salt marshes (Wong 
et al. 2014a) (Section 5.4.1). In some cases, effective interventions 
requires management at a broad spatial scale that includes a variety 
of ecosystems, for example, including ecosystems like mussel beds 
on the seaward side of seagrass beds to reduce wave energy and 
erosion (Ondiviela et al. 2014). Where sediment accretion matches 
the SLR rate, wetlands and salt marshes provide effective coastal 
protection and other important ecosystem services (high conﬁdence).
Coastal dune systems are widely transformed globally. Human 
disturbance and the limited stabilising ability of dune vegetation 
are key causes of degradation (Onaka et al. 2015; Ranasinghe, 2016; 
MacDonald et al. 2017; Pranzini, 2017; Salgado and Martinez, 2017; 
Vikolainen et al. 2017; Gracia et al. 2018), while restoration efforts can 
be supported by both hard (Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; Pranzini, 2017) 
and soft (Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; Vikolainen et al. 2017) engineering 
responses. Reduced coastal erosion (Sánchez-Arcilla et  al. 2016; 
Goreau and Prong, 2017; Vikolainen et al. 2017; Carro, 2018; Gracia 
et al. 2018) and ﬂood risk (Onaka et al. 2015; MacDonald et al. 2017; 
Nehren et  al. 2017) through maintaining dunes as natural buffers 
against wave energy (Nehren et al. 2017) can increase resilience to 
climate change impacts (Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; Magnan and Duvat, 
2018). Engineered responses and sand replenishment are considered 
complementary approaches (Onaka et al. 2015; Martínez et al. 2017). 
Section 4.4.4.1 provides an overview of sediment-based adaptation 
response measures, including cost estimates for beach nourishment 
and dune maintenance, a discussion of co-beneﬁts and drawbacks 
of combining hard and soft infrastructure measures, and challenges 
with sourcing sediment for beach replenishment. In some cases dune 
restoration and sand replenishment projects have not been successful, 
due to ﬁre damage (Shumack and Hesse, 2017) or the rapid loss of 
sand within replenishment schemes due to coastal processes and 
stakeholder rejection of adaptation activities (Pranzini, 2017). Coastal 
dune restoration and beach replenishment are effective responses 
against coastal erosion and ﬂooding, where sufﬁcient materials and 
space to implement are available (medium conﬁdence).
5.5.2.1.4 Ecosystem-based adaptation
There is a growing body of literature regarding the effectiveness 
and economics of EbA. In addition to building resilience to climate 
change, EbA is expected to bring a wide range of co-beneﬁts that 
include increasing ecological complexity, with multiple ecosystem 
services, and other economic co-beneﬁts (Perkins et al. 2015; Perry, 
2015; Moosavi, 2017; Scarano, 2017). The cost-effectiveness of EbA 
approaches varies between marine ecosystem types; for example, 
coral reefs (Perkins et al. 2015; Beetham et al. 2017; Elliff and Silva, 
2017; Beck et al. 2018; Comte and Pendleton, 2018) and salt-marshes 
(Ondiviela et al. 2014; Miloshis and Fairﬁeld, 2015; Schaeffer-Novelli 
et al. 2016; Wigand et al. 2017) performed best at reducing wave 
heights, whilst salt marshes and mangroves were two to ﬁve times 
cheaper than submerged breakwaters for wave heights of less 
than half a meter. Although low regrets, win-win approaches like 
EbA are supported in the literature (Watkiss et  al. 2014; Barange 
et al. 2018), syntheses of experience from context-speciﬁc practical 
implementation of EbA and assessment of their cost-effectiveness are 
limited (Narayan et al. 2016). Therefore, EbA can be a cost-effective 
approach for securing climate change-related ecosystem services 
with multiple co-beneﬁts (medium evidence, high agreement).
The application of EbA approaches can be more effective when 
incorporating local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge and 
cultural practices into adaptation responses (Ataur Rahman 
and Rahman, 2015; Perkins et  al. 2015; Sutton-Grier et  al. 2015; 
Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2016; van der Nat et al. 2016). The application 
of synergistic combinations of adaptation responses in multiple 
ecosystems can provide a range of co-beneﬁts, and this approach 
is strengthened when combined with socioinstitutional approaches 
(Kochnower et al. 2015; MacDonald et al. 2017). Research to improve 
and reﬁne EbA approaches and increase their speciﬁcity to local 
context is important for their effectiveness in reducing climate risks 
and generating co-beneﬁts (Sutton-Grier et  al. 2015). Conversely, 
a lack of inclusion of local communities and economic undervaluation 
of speciﬁc coastal and marine ecosystems, compounded by gaps in 
scientiﬁc data, can undermine the potential effectiveness of EbA 
approaches (Perkins et al. 2015; Hernández-González et al.; Narayan 
et al. 2016; Roberts et al. 2017).
Despite the abundance of EbA examples in the literature, knowledge 
gaps pertaining to their implementation and limitations remain. 
Developing this literature could help with understanding context 
speciﬁc application of EbA and improve their effectiveness 
(medium conﬁdence).
5.5.2.2 
Human Systems
Many of the world’s great cities lie within the coastal region, and 
climate change impacts put these cities, their inhabitants and their 
economic activities at risk. Section 5.5.2.2 assesses the impacts 
of climate change, adaptation response and beneﬁts upon human 
systems, including coastal communities, built infrastructure, ﬁsheries 
and aquaculture, coastal tourism, government and health systems. 
Table 5.8 provides a summary of the assessment, with citations 
provided in the Supplementary Material Table 5.7.
Poorly planned (Ataur Rahman and Rahman, 2015), located (Abedin 
et al. 2014; Betzold and Mohamed, 2017; Linkon, 2018) and managed 
urban settlements or human systems, driven by growing human 
coastal populations (Perkins et  al. 2015; Moosavi, 2017; Carter, 
2018) and compounded by the disruption of coastal and catchment 
physical processes (Nagy et al. 2014; Broto et al. 2015; Marfai et al. 
2015; Kabisch et al. 2017) and pollution (Zikra et al. 2015; Peng et al. 
2017) are major human drivers of change compounding the impacts 
of climate change.
Coastal communities, built infrastructure and ﬁsheries and 
aquaculture (Table 5.8) are likely to be signiﬁcantly affected through 
the disruption of coastal physical processes (DasGupta and Shaw, 
2015; Betzold and Mohamed, 2017; Hagedoorn et al. 2019) leading to 
coastal erosion, ﬂooding, salt water intrusion and built infrastructure 
damage (Dhar and Khirfan, 2016; Hobday et al. 2016a; Jurjonas and 
Seekamp, 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement).

Ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss will further compound 
impacts in coastal communities and ﬁsheries and aquaculture (Ataur 
Rahman and Rahman, 2015; Petzold and Ratter, 2015; Dhar and 
Khirfan, 2016), with sub-lethal species impacts like changes in the 
productivity and distribution of ﬁsheries target species reported for 
the latter (Gourlie et al. 2018; Nursey-Bray et al. 2018; Pinsky et al. 
2018) (high conﬁdence). This is likely to result in decreased access to 
ecosystem services (Asch et al. 2018; Cheung et al. 2018b; Finkbeiner 
et al. 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement), local declines in 
agriculture and ﬁsheries (Cvitanovic et al. 2016; Faraco et al. 2016) 
(high conﬁdence) and livelihood impacts (Harkes et al. 2015; Busch 
et al. 2016; Valmonte-Santos et al. 2016) (high conﬁdence) in coastal 
communities and ﬁsheries and aquaculture, particularly increased 
food insecurity and health risk in the latter (high conﬁdence). These 
livelihood impacts are likely to increase social vulnerability (high 
conﬁdence). Businesses within coastal communities are likely to 
experience disruptions and losses (robust evidence, high agreement).
5.5.2.2.1 Coastal communities
This section describes a range of adaptation responses reported at 
the level of the individual or community. Hard engineering responses 
included small scale hard infrastructure coastal defenses (Betzold and 
Mohamed, 2017; Jamero et al. 2018), design responses at the household 
level (Ataur Rahman and Rahman, 2015; Linkon, 2018) and retreat 
(Marfai et al. 2015). Ecosystem restoration and protection, particularly 
in mangroves (Ataur Rahman and Rahman, 2015; Bennett et  al. 
2016; Jamero et al. 2018; Hagedoorn et al. 2019) through community 
participation programmes (Barbier, 2015; Petzold and Ratter, 2015; 
Bennett et al. 2016; Dhar and Khirfan, 2016; Jamero et al. 2018) was 
strongly supported in the literature as a means to improve access to 
or storage of natural resources (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Social responses include increasing climate change awareness, 
improving participatory decision making through bottom-up 
approaches, community organisation for action and engagements 
with local management authorities (Dutra et al. 2015; Tapsuwan and 
Rongrongmuang, 2015; Galappaththi et al. 2017; Ray et al. 2017; 
Cinner et al. 2018; Hagedoorn et al. 2019). In coastal communities, and 
indeed in most other sectors, despite consensus on the importance 
of cooperation in tackling climate change (Elrick-Barr et al. 2016), 
adaptation progress may be hampered by competing economic 
interests and worldviews (Hamilton and Safford, 2015), which can be 
compounded by limited climate change knowledge (Nanlohy et al. 
2015). Factors like home ownership and a general future planning 
ability support resilience (Elrick-Barr et  al. 2016). Climate change 
adaptation capacity is shaped by historical path dependencies, local 
context and international linkages, while action is shaped by science, 
research partnerships and citizen participation (Hernández-Delgado, 
2015; Sheller and León, 2016). Locally context-speciﬁc data to guide 
appropriate adaptation response remains a knowledge gap (Abedin 
and Shaw, 2015; Hobday et al. 2015; Lirman and Schopmeyer, 2016; 
Williams et al. 2016).
Coastal and oceanic adaptation responses are greatly complicated 
by the presence of competing interests (either between user groups, 
communities or nations), where considerations other than climate 
change need to be incorporated into cooperation agreements 
and policy (Wong et al. 2014a). The deployment of either built or 
natural protection systems, or adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach, is 
subject to the social acceptance of these approaches in communities 
(Poumadère et  al. 2015; Sherren et  al. 2016; Torabi et  al. 2018). 
Similarly, the willingness to move away from climate change impacted 
zones is dependent upon a range of other socioeconomic factors 
like age, access to resources and crime (Bukvic et al.; Rulleau and 
Rey-Valette, 2017). Adaptation to climate change includes a range of 
non-climatic and social variables that complicate implementation of 
adaptation plans (robust evidence, high agreement).
Improving community participation and integrating knowledge 
systems (local, traditional and scientiﬁc) supports coastal community 
adaptation responses (high conﬁdence), providing improved 
co-production of knowledge (medium evidence, high agreement), 
improved community awareness (medium evidence, medium 
agreement) and better-informed, more cohesive coastal communities 
(limited evidence, medium agreement).
5.5.2.2.2 Built infrastructure
Built infrastructure impacts are most frequently addressed through 
hard engineering approaches including: construction of groins, 
seawalls, revetments, gabions and breakwaters (Friedrich and 
Kretzinger, 2012; Vikolainen et  al. 2017); improving drainage and 
raising the height of roadways and other ﬁxed-location infrastructure 
(Perkins et al. 2015; Becker et al. 2016; Colin et al. 2016; Asadabadi 
and Miller-Hooks, 2017; Brown et al. 2018a); erosion control systems 
(Jeong et  al. 2014); and the relocation of infrastructure (Friedrich 
and Kretzinger, 2012; Colin et al. 2016). Nature-based responses are 
increasingly being reported as complementary and supporting tools 
(van der Nat et al. 2016; Kabisch et al. 2017; Gracia et al. 2018) using 
ecological engineering (Perkins et al. 2015; van der Nat et al. 2016; 
Moosavi, 2017) combined with innovative construction strategies 
(Moosavi, 2017). 
When implemented together, hard and soft engineering responses 
provide social (Gracia et al. 2018; Martínez et al. 2018; Woodruff, 
2018) and ecological (Perkins et al. 2015; van der Nat et al. 2016; 
Gracia et al. 2018) co-beneﬁts with reduced damage costs (Jeong et al. 
2014). Constraints on implementation include the space and extra cost 
required by ecological infrastructure, sub-optimal performance when 
impacted by natural physical processes that are disrupted (Gracia 
et al. 2018) or restrictions associated with governance (Vikolainen 
et al. 2017). Adaptation planning including local communities can 
improve implementation and help ﬁll knowledge gaps (Kaja and 
Mellic, 2017; Moosavi, 2017; Martínez et al. 2018; Mikellidou et al. 
2018). Beneﬁts include increased resilience in coastal infrastructure 
and better informed decision making tools (medium conﬁdence). 
5.5.2.2.3 Adaptation in ﬁsheries and aquaculture
Sixty percent of assessed species are projected to be at high risk from 
both overﬁshing and climate change by 2050 (RCP8.5), particularly 
tropical and subtropical species (Cheung et al. 2018b). Overﬁshing 
is one of the most important non-climatic drivers affecting the 
535
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5

sustainability of ﬁsheries (Islam et al. 2013; Heenan et al. 2015; Faraco 
et al. 2016; Dasgupta et al. 2017; Cheung et al. 2018b; Harvey et al. 
2018). Pursuing sustainable ﬁsheries practices under a low emissions 
scenario would decrease risk by 63%. This highlights the importance 
of effective ﬁsheries management (Gaines et al. 2018). Eliminating 
overﬁshing would, however, require reducing current levels of ﬁshing 
effort, with a potential short-term reduction in catches impacting 
livelihoods and the food security of coastal communities (Hobday 
et al. 2015; Dey et al. 2016; Rosegrant et al. 2016; Campbell, 2017; 
Finkbeiner et al. 2018). Despite consensus on the effectiveness of 
eliminating overﬁshing in supporting climate change adaptation in 
ﬁsheries (robust evidence, high agreement), successful adaptation 
outcomes remain aspirational. 
Range shifts under ocean warming (Section 5.2.3) will alter the 
distribution of ﬁsh stocks across political boundaries, thus demand for 
transboundary ﬁsheries management will increase. Redistribution of 
transboundary ﬁsh stocks between countries (Ho et al. 2016; Gourlie 
et al. 2017; Asch et al. 2018) could destabilise existing international 
ﬁsheries agreements and increase the risk of international conﬂicts 
(Section 5.4.2). Adaptation to reduce risks in international ﬁsheries 
management could involve improving planning for cooperative 
management between countries informed by reliable predictions 
(Payne et al. 2017) and projections (Pinsky et al. 2018) of species shifts 
and associated uncertainties. Cooperative international ﬁsheries 
arrangements, such as ﬂexible ﬁshing effort allocation and adaptive 
frameworks (Colburn et al. 2016; Cvitanovic et al. 2016; Faraco et al. 
2016) may also improve the robustness of ﬁsheries management 
(Miller et  al. 2013). Thus, although range shifts pose signiﬁcant 
challenges to transboundary ﬁsheries management, proactive 
planning and adjustment of ﬁsheries management arrangements, 
informed by scientiﬁc projections, could help improve adaptive 
capacity (medium conﬁdence). The effectiveness of incorporating 
MPAs as an adaptation strategy to climate change can be improved 
by considering climate impacts in the design of MPAs (medium, 
high agreement). 
Improving integrated coastal management and better planning for 
MPAs by incorporating projected shifting biological communities, 
abundance and life history changes (Álvarez-Romero et  al. 2018) 
due to climate change could contribute towards improved ﬁsheries 
adaptive management by, for example, increasing resilience of 
habitats, providing refugia for species with shifting distributions and 
by conserving biodiversity (Faraco et al. 2016; Valmonte-Santos et al. 
2016; Dasgupta et al. 2017; Le Cornu et al. 2017; Roberts et al. 2017; 
Asch et al. 2018; Cheung et al. 2018b; Harvey et al. 2018; Jones et al. 
2018; O’Leary and Roberts, 2018) (Sections 5.2.3, 5.3, 5.4.1), but 
MPAs may also reduce access to subsistence ﬁshers, increasing their 
vulnerability to food insecurity (Bennett et al. 2016; Faraco et al. 2016). 
The global area of MPAs is rapidly increasing towards the United 
Nations’ target of 10% of the global ocean. While this is encouraging, 
it is estimated that only 2% of the ocean is well enough managed, 
as described in (Edgar et  al. 2014), to meet conservation goals 
(Sala et al. 2018). Improving the implementation and coordination 
of policies, and improving integrated coastal management and MPAs 
have emerged in the literature as important adaptation governance 
responses (robust evidence, medium agreement).
Governance responses to support adaptation in ﬁsheries communities 
include conducting vulnerability assessments, improving monitoring 
of ecosystem indicators and evaluating management strategies 
(Himes-Cornell and Kasperski, 2015b; Busch et al. 2016). Socioeconomic 
factors like access to alternative income, mobility, gender and religion 
collectively shape a community’s adaptation response (Arroyo Mina 
et al. 2016). In West Africa, the industrial ﬁshery response to climate 
change induced reductions in landings was the expansion of ﬁshing 
grounds, which increased operational costs (Belhabib et al. 2016). This 
response is not available to artisanal and local ﬁshing communities, 
who are considered highly vulnerable (Kais and Islam, 2017). Access 
to ﬁnance to support these communities or their governments could 
help them reach novel ﬁshing grounds, and, therefore, potentially 
reduce their vulnerability. Food security linked to ﬁsheries depends on 
stock recovery, but also on access to and distribution of the harvest, 
as well as gender considerations (Béné et al. 2015). Hence, granting 
preferential access to dependent coastal communities should be 
considered in examining policy options. Other adaptation responses 
include improved ﬁshing gear and technology, use of ﬁsh aggregating 
devices and uptake of insurance products (Zougmoré et al. 2016) [see 
Barange et al. (2018) for a summary of possible adaptation responses]. 
Community response as a part of climate change adaptation for local 
ﬁsheries is an important element in assessing adaptive capacity 
(medium evidence, good agreement).
Fisheries management strategies depend heavily upon data 
collection and monitoring systems. These include the accuracy of 
data collected in respect of predicting environmental conditions, 
over time scales from months to decades (Dunstan et  al. 2018), 
effective monitoring and evaluative mechanisms (Le Cornu et  al. 
2017; Gourlie et al. 2018), controlling for aspects of ﬁsh population 
dynamics like recruitment success and ﬁsh movement (Mace, 2001). 
Seasonal to decadal  climate prediction  systems allow for skillful 
predictions of climate variables relevant to ﬁsheries management 
strategies (Hobday et  al. 2016b; Payne et  al. 2017). Effective 
ﬁsheries adaptation responses will require knowledge development 
including better monitoring, modelling and improving decision 
support frameworks (medium evidence, high agreement) and 
improving forecasting and early warning systems (medium evidence, 
medium agreement).
In considering a participatory decision making approach for ﬁsheries 
management that responds to climate change, Heenan et al. (2015) 
provided a number of key elements that contribute towards 
a  successful outcome. These include expert knowledge of climate 
change threats to ﬁsh habitats, stocks and landings, the necessity 
of transdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder participation, 
broadening the range and scope of ﬁsheries systems and increased 
commitment of resources and capacity. This was considered in the 
context of the ability of developing countries to sustainably exploit 
ﬁsheries resources and related ecosystems. More research is required 
on socio-ecological responses to climate change impacts on ﬁshery 
communities, including such aspect as like risk reduction, adaptive 
capacity through knowledge attainment and social networks, 
developing alternative skills and participatory approaches to 
decision making (Dubey et al. 2017; Shaffril et al. 2017; Finkbeiner 
et al. 2018). Important ﬁsheries adaptation responses in relation to 
536
Chapter 5 
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities

knowledge management include improving participatory processes 
(robust evidence, high agreement), integrating knowledge systems 
(medium evidence, high agreement), and stakeholder identiﬁcation, 
outreach and education (medium evidence, medium agreement). 
Ecosystem-based adaptation, community participatory programmes, 
and improving agricultural and ﬁsheries practices are very strongly 
supported in the literature (high conﬁdence).
Less still is known about how climate change will affect the deep 
oceans and its ﬁsheries (Section 5.2.3 and 5.2.4), the vulnerability of 
its habitats to ﬁshing disturbance and future effects on resources not 
currently harvested (FAO, 2019). Johnson et al. (2019) concluded that 
in a 20- to 50-year timeframe, the effectiveness of virtually all north 
Atlantic deep water and open ocean area-based management tools 
can be expected to be affected. They concluded that more precise 
and detailed oceanographic data are needed to determine possible 
refugia, and more research on adaptation and resilience in the deep 
sea is needed to predict ecosystem response times. 
As with ﬁsheries, community- and ecosystem-based adaptation 
responses, an integrated coastal management framework is 
considered useful for planning for anticipated challenges for 
aquaculture (Ahmed and Diana, 2015b; Barange et  al. 2018). 
Where in situ adaptation is not possible, translocation and 
polyculture (Ahmed and Diana, 2015a; Bunting et al. 2017) have 
been suggested as appropriate responses, but this would suit 
commercial rather than subsistence interests. Policy, economic, 
knowledge and other types of support are required to build socio-
ecological resilience of vulnerable coastal aquaculture communities 
(Harkes et al. 2015; Bunting et al. 2017; Rodríguez-Rodríguez and 
Bande Ramudo, 2017), which requires a deep understanding of 
the nature of stressors and a commitment for collective action 
(Galappaththi et al. 2017). Climate resilient pathway development 
(see Cross-Chapter Box 2) is considered a useful framework for Sri 
Lankan shrimp aquaculture (Harkes et al. 2015). Another example 
of successful aquaculture adaptation is the employment of near 
real time monitoring technology to track the carbonate chemistry 
in water to reduce bio-erosion in shellﬁsh from acidiﬁcation (Barton 
et al. 2015; Cooley et al. 2016). Numerous adaptation responses are 
available for aquaculture, but some options, like translocation and 
technological responses may not be available to subsistence-based 
communities (medium evidence). 
An example of eco-engineering-based adaptation option in seaweed 
aquaculture under climate change is artiﬁcial upwelling, as shown by 
experiments and observations. Artiﬁcial upwelling powered by green 
energy (solar, wind, wave or tidal energy) to seaweeds (Jiao et al. 
2014b; Zhang et al. 2015; Pan and Schimel, 2016) can moderate the 
amount of deep water upwelled to the euphotic zone to just meet 
the demands of nutrients and DIC by the seaweed for photosynthesis, 
while avoiding the acidiﬁcation and hypoxia that often occur in 
natural upwelling systems (Jiao et al. 2018a; Jiao et al. 2018b) (high 
conﬁdence). Such artiﬁcial upwelling based eco-engineering may 
also gradually release the ‘bomb’ of rich nutrients and hypoxia in 
the bottom water, which could otherwise breakout following storms 
(Daneri et al. 2012) (high conﬁdence). 
5.5.2.3.4 Coastal tourism
The coastal tourism economic sector is highly sensitive to climate 
change. Tourism response, in terms of mitigating carbon emissions 
and adapting to climate change impacts, are assessed here. Coastal 
tourism is likely to be impacted by ecosystem degradation and 
loss (limited evidence, medium agreement), which underscores the 
importance of nature-based tourism. An example of coastal erosion 
in Latin America illustrates this, whereby SLR interacting with 
non-climate change impacts including sand mining, inappropriate 
development and habitat destruction (e.g., mangroves), resulted in 
declines in tourism (Rangel-Buitrago et al. 2015). The management 
recommendation was appropriate legislation with a marine spatial 
planning emphasis, enforcement, sustainable funding mechanisms 
and support networks for decision making.
Climate change impacts upon tourism are nuanced and not restricted 
to just physical impacts on tourism establishments (Biggs et al. 2015). 
Understanding the drivers of tourist choices could help support 
adaptation in the industry through marine spatial planning processes 
(Papageorgiou, 2016). For example, in an survey ranking mitigation 
and adaptation responses in Greece, tourists prioritised rational 
energy use, energy efﬁciency and water saving measures (Michailidou 
et al. 2016b). Location speciﬁc information of tourist choices could 
help shape local industries. In one example from the Thailand dive 
industry, climate change adaptation responses of participants were 
reported to be based on misconceptions about climate change and 
personal observations (Tapsuwan and Rongrongmuang, 2015). To 
improve community-based adaptation, efforts aimed at broadening 
the level of awareness about climate change could improve decision 
making processes (Tapsuwan and Rongrongmuang, 2015). Tourist 
behaviour is shaped by changing ocean physical processes and 
degrading ecosystems at tourist destinations, which drive destination 
changes, economic ﬂows and market share adjustments. (Bujosa 
et al. 2015; De Urioste-Stone et al. 2016). 
It is very likely that climate change will have direct and nuanced 
impacts upon coastal tourism. Improving decision support 
frameworks (low evidence, medium agreement) for better-informed 
decision making tools could contribute towards increasing resilience 
in coastal tourism (low evidence, limited agreement).
5.5.2.2.5 Government responses
Government responses included adopting and mainstreaming 
sustainability policies, including investments and policies for climate 
change (Aylett, 2015; Buurman and Babovic, 2016) and applying 
the precautionary principle in the absence of precise scientiﬁc 
guidance (Johnson et  al. 2018). Developing adequate governance 
and management systems (Johnson et  al. 2018), strengthening 
capacity (Gallo et  al. 2017; Paterson et  al. 2017), increasing 
cooperation (Nunn et al. 2014; Gormley et al. 2015) and aligning 
policies of local authorities (Porter et  al. 2015; Gallo et  al. 2017; 
Rosendo et al. 2018) could help to improve implementation (Sano 
et  al. 2015; Elsharouny, 2016). This includes planning for MPAs 
and improving integrated coastal management (Abelshausen et al. 
2015; Roberts et  al. 2017; Rosendo et  al. 2018) by incorporating 
537
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5
5
climate science (Hopkins et al. 2016; Johnson et al. 2018) to optimise 
priority marine habitats (Gormley et  al. 2015; Jones et  al. 2018). 
An advantage of integrated coastal management is that it helps 
manage the interactions between multiple climate and non-climatic 
drivers of coastal ecosystems and sectors. Incorporating stakeholder 
participation with local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge 
could help to reduce the risk of maladaptation, and increase buy-
in for implementation (Serrao-Neumann et  al. 2013). Improving 
participatory processes strengthens governance decision making and 
ﬂexible risk management processes (Gerkensmeier and Ratter, 2018; 
Rosendo et  al. 2018), while stimulating bi-directional knowledge 
ﬂow and improving social learning (Abelshausen et al. 2015).
Technology for environmental monitoring, for example using drones 
(Clark, 2017), web-based coastal information systems (Mayerle et al. 
2016; Newell and Canessa, 2017), the Internet of Things and machine 
learning solutions promise to improve the local scale knowledge base, 
which should improve climate adaptation planning and resilience 
effort and environmental management decisions (Conde  et  al. 
2015). Where such knowledge gaps persist, the implementation of 
climate change adaptation measures could proceed on the basis 
of a set of general principals of best practice (Sheaves et al. 2016; 
Thorne et al. 2017).
Beneﬁts of effective government adaptation response includes the 
promotion of sustainable use, development and protection of coastal 
ecosystems (Rosendo et al. 2018) and the protection of biodiversity 
through setting appropriate conservation priorities (Gormley et al. 
2015). Improved governance includes consideration of social 
processes in risk management (Gerkensmeier and Ratter, 2018; 
Rosendo et al. 2018) and improved systematic conservation planning 
(Johnson et al. 2018). At a local level, this translates into sustained 
service delivery (Aylett, 2015), improved rationality and effective 
policy making (Serrao-Neumann et al. 2013; Rosendo et al. 2018).
Improving the implementation and coordination of policies and 
improving integrated coastal management are both considered 
important climate change adaptation governance responses (robust 
evidence, high agreement), as are developing partnerships and 
building capacity (medium evidence, high agreement) and adopting 
or mainstreaming sustainability policies (limited evidence, medium 
agreement). Beneﬁts include improved ecosystem resilience, better 
planning processes, implementation and policies (all limited evidence, 
medium agreement).
5.5.2.3 
Ocean-based Climate Change Adaptation Frameworks
Adaptation action in pursuit of a climate resilient development 
pathway is likely to have a deeper transformative outcome than 
stepwise or ad hoc responses (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). 
Recent literature highlighting the effectiveness of components 
of adaptation planning includes quantitative assessments of 
vulnerability in ecosystems (Kuhfuss et al. 2016), species (Cheung 
et al. 2015; Cushing et al. 2018), and communities (Islam et al. 2013; 
Himes-Cornell and Kasperski, 2015b), and integrated assessments 
of all of the above (Peirson et al. 2015; Kaplan-Hallam et al. 2017; 
McNeeley et al. 2017; Ramm et al. 2017; Mavromatidi et al. 2018). 
Seasonal and decadal forecasting tools have improved rapidly since 
AR5, especially in supporting management of living marine resources 
(Payne et  al. 2017) and modelling to support decision making 
processes (Čerkasova et al. 2016; Chapman and Darby, 2016; Jiang 
et al. 2016; Justic et al. 2016; Joyce et al. 2017; Mitchell et al. 2017). 
Decision making processes are supported by economic evaluations 
(Bujosa et  al. 2015; Jones et  al. 2015), evaluations of ecosystem 
services (MacDonald et al. 2017; Micallef et al. 2018), participatory 
processes (Byrne et  al. 2015) and social learning outcomes, the 
development of adaptation pathways, frameworks and decision 
making (Buurman and Babovic, 2016; Dittrich et al. 2016; Michailidou 
et  al. 2016a; Osorio-Cano et  al. 2017; Cumiskey et  al. 2018), and 
indicators to support evaluation of adaptation actions (Carapuço 
et  al. 2016; Nguyen et  al. 2016) through monitoring frameworks 
(Huxham et  al. 2015). Climate change adaptation responses are 
more effective when developed within institutional frameworks that 
include effective planning and cross-sector integration.
Evidence-based decision making for climate adaptation is strongly 
supported in the literature (Endo et  al. 2017; Thorne et  al. 2017) 
through better understanding of coastal ecosystems and human 
adaptation responses (Dutra et al. 2015; Cvitanovic et al. 2016), as 
well as consideration of non-climate change related factors. Relevant 
research includes the topics of: multiple-stakeholder participatory 
planning (Archer et al. 2014; Abedin and Shaw, 2015); trans-boundary 
ocean management (Gormley et  al. 2015; Williams et  al. 2016); 
ecosystem-based adaptation (Hobday et  al. 2015; Dalyander et  al. 
2016; McNeeley et al. 2017; Osorio-Cano et al. 2017); and community-
based adaptation with socioeconomic outcomes (Merkens et  al. 
2016). Research on applying ‘big data’ and high end computational 
capabilities could also help develop a comprehensive understanding 
of climate and non-climate variables in planning for coastal adaptation 
(Rumson et  al. 2017). New knowledge from these research areas 
could substantially improve planning, implementation and monitoring 
of climate adaptation responses for marine systems, if research 
processes are participatory and inclusive (medium conﬁdence).
Despite such interest, evaluations of the planning, implementation and 
monitoring of adaptation actions remain scarce (Miller et al. 2017). In 
a global analysis of 401 local governments, only 15% reported on 
adaptation actions (mostly large cities in high income countries), and 
18% reported on planning towards adaptation policy (Araos et al. 
2016). Thus, integrated adaptation planning with non-climate change 
related impacts remains an under-achieved ambition, especially in 
developing countries (Finkbeiner et al. 2018). Challenges reported for 
adaptation planning include uncoordinated, top-down approaches, 
a lack of political will, insufﬁcient resources (Elias and Omojola, 2015; 
Porter et al. 2015), and access to information (Thorne et al. 2017).
Characteristics of successful adaptation frameworks include: 
a  robust but ﬂexible approach, accounting for deep uncertainty 
through well-coordinated participatory processes (Dutra et al. 2015; 
Jiao et al. 2015; Buurman and Babovic, 2016; Dittrich et al. 2016); 
well-developed monitoring systems (Barrett et al. 2015; Bell et al. 
2018b); and taking a whole systems approach (Sheaves et al. 2016), 
with the identiﬁcation of co-beneﬁts for human development and the 
environment (Wise et al. 2016). The coastal adaptation framework

literature is dominated by Australian, North American and European 
cities, with fewer studies from African and Caribbean sites, least 
developed countries and SIDS (Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; Torresan 
et al. 2016). 
In contrast with the many examples of proposed frameworks for 
climate resilient coastal adaptation, few studies have assessed 
their success, possibly due to the time-lag between implementation, 
monitoring, evaluation and reporting. Nevertheless, there is substantial 
support for ‘no regrets’ approaches addressing both proximate and 
systematic underlying drivers of vulnerability (Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 
2016; Pentz and Klenk, 2017; Zandvoort et al. 2017) with leadership, 
adaptive management, capacity and the monitoring and evaluation 
of actions considered useful in governance responses (Dutra et al. 
2015; Doherty et al. 2016). More extensive learning processes could 
help build decision makers’ capacity to tackle systemic drivers, guide 
pursuance climate change appropriate policies (Barange et al. 2018) 
and to scrutinise potentially maladaptive infrastructural investments 
(Wise et  al. 2016). More effective coordination across a range 
of stakeholders, within and between organisations, especially in 
developing countries, would strengthen the global coastal adaptation 
response (medium conﬁdence).
5.5.2.4 
The Role of Education and Local Knowledge 
in Adapting to Climate Change
Education can help improve understanding of issues related to climate 
change and increase adaptive capacity (Fauville et al. 2011; Marshall 
et  al. 2013; von Heland et  al. 2014; Pescaroli and Magni, 2015; 
Tapsuwan and Rongrongmuang, 2015; Wynveen and Sutton, 2015). 
Participatory processes can facilitate the development of networks 
between coastal communities and environmental managers for the 
purposes of developing and implementing adaptation strategies 
(Wynveen and Sutton, 2015). Education, combined with other 
forms of institutional support empowers ﬁsheries and aquaculture 
communities (Table 5.8) to make informed adaptation decisions and 
take action (medium evidence, medium agreement).
Local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge systems can complement 
scientiﬁc knowledge by, for example, improving community ability 
to understand their local environment (Andrachuk and Armitage, 
2015), forecast extreme events (Audefroy and Sánchez, 2017) and 
help to increase community resilience (Leon et al. 2015; Sakakibara, 
2017; Cinner et al. 2018; Panikkar et al. 2018). Committing resources 
could strengthen local level adaptation planning (Alam et  al. 
2016; Novak Colwell et al. 2017) through the inclusion of cultural 
practices (Audefroy and Sánchez, 2017; Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017) 
and Indigenous knowledge systems (Kuruppu and Willie, 2015; von 
Storch et al. 2015). Local knowledge can, however, act as a barrier 
to adaptation where there is a strong dependency upon such 
knowledge for immediate survival, to the detriment of long-term 
adaptation planning (Marshall et  al. 2013; Metcalf et  al. 2015). 
There is evidence, however, to suggest that vulnerability in ﬁsheries 
communities and coastal tourism operators with high levels of Local 
knowledge is reduced where they have a correspondingly high level 
of adaptive capacity (Marshall et al. 2013). Resource users with high 
levels of local knowledge may also be able to identify signals of 
change within their environment, and recognise the need to adapt. In 
these instances, ﬁshers with higher local knowledge are expected to 
demonstrate a higher adaptive capacity than ﬁshers with lower local 
knowledge, and can be expected to progress towards developing 
new strategies to combat the impacts of climate change (Kittinger 
et  al. 2012). In these instances, local knowledge acts to promote 
adaptation (medium conﬁdence). 
Localised, individual-scale behaviors can aggregate rapidly and 
contribute to the global adaptation response. This can be supported by 
clear messaging that clariﬁes the role of individuals, households and 
local businesses in addressing climate change. Coastal communities 
can improve the co-production of climate change knowledge (medium 
evidence, good agreement) through the integration of knowledge 
systems (Table 5.8). In ﬁsheries and aquaculture, better-informed 
decision making tools (medium evidence, medium agreement) are 
supported by improved participatory processes (high conﬁdence), 
integrating knowledge systems (medium evidence, good agreement) 
and improving decision support frameworks (medium evidence, 
medium agreement). 
5.5.2.5 
Costs and Limits for Coastal Climate 
Change Adaptation
Challenges persist in conducting economic assessments for built 
infrastructure adaptation due to complicated uncertainties such as 
the accuracy of climate projections and limited information regarding 
paths for future economic growth and adaptation technologies. 
Annual investment and maintenance costs of protecting coasts were 
projected to be 12–71 billion USD (Hinkel et al. 2014), which was 
considered signiﬁcantly less than damage costs in the absence of 
such action. In an analysis of twelve Paciﬁc island countries, 57% of 
assessed built infrastructure was located within 500 m of coastlines, 
requiring a replacement value of 21.9 billion USD. Substantial 
coastal adaptation costs (and international ﬁnancing) are likely to be 
required in these countries (medium conﬁdence).
In West African ﬁsheries, loss of coastal ecosystems and productivity 
are estimated to require 5–10% of countries’ GDP in adaptation 
costs (Zougmoré et al. 2016). Similarly, for Paciﬁc Islands and Coastal 
Territories, ﬁsheries adaptation will require signiﬁcant investment 
from local governments and the private sector (Rosegrant et al. 2016), 
with adaptation costs considered beyond the means of most of these 
countries (Campbell, 2017). In SIDS, tourism could provide the funding 
for climate change adaptation, but concerns with creating investment 
barriers, assumptions around cost-effectiveness and consumer 
driven demand remain barriers (Hess and Kelman, 2017). MPAs with 
multiple co-beneﬁts, are considered a cost-effective strategy (Byrne 
et al. 2015). In 2004, the annual cost of managing 20–30% of global 
seas as MPAs was estimated at between 5–19 billion USD, with the 
creation of approximately one million jobs (Balmford et al. 2004).
Estimating adaptation costs is challenging because of wide ranging 
regional responses and uncertainty (Dittrich et al. 2016). Despite these 
challenges, the protection from ﬂooding and frequent storms that 
coral reefs provide has been quantiﬁed by (Beck et al. 2018), who 
estimated that without reefs, damage from ﬂooding and costs from 
539
Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5

frequent storms would double and triple respectively, while countries 
from Southeast Asia, East Asia and Central America could each save in 
excess of 400 million USD through good reef management. Although 
quantifying global adaptation costs remains challenging because 
of a wide range of regional responses and contexts, it is likely that 
managing ecosystems will contribute towards reducing costs associated 
with climate change associated coastal storms (medium conﬁdence). 
Further research evaluating natural infrastructure is required (Roberts 
et al. 2017) to better understand costs and beneﬁts of EBA.
There is a broad range of reported barriers and limits to climate 
change adaptation for both ecosystems and human systems. Coastal 
ecosystem-based adaptation can be physically constrained by 
space requirements and coastal squeeze (Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; 
Robins et al. 2016; Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2016; Ahmed et al. 2017; 
Peña-Alonso et al. 2017; Salgado and Martinez, 2017; Triyanti et al. 
2017; Schuerch et al. 2018), while the pace of climate change may 
exceed the adaptive capacity of ecosystems, for example, SLR may 
outpace the vertical reef accretion rate (Beetham et al. 2017; Elliff 
and Silva, 2017; Joyce et al. 2017). One technical limit for coral reef 
adaptation is that tools have not yet been developed for large-scale 
implementation (van Oppen et al. 2017a). Ecosystems may also have 
physiological and ecological constraints which are exceeded by 
climate change impacts (Miller et al. 2017; Wigand et al. 2017), and 
the recovery periods of natural systems (Gracia et al. 2018) and for 
ecological succession (Salgado and Martinez, 2017) may be outpaced 
by climate change impacts. The performance of ecosystems in EBA 
projects may be inhibited by the poor condition of the ecosystem 
(Nehren et  al. 2017), highlighting the importance of effective 
implementation (Salgado and Martinez, 2017).
Social and cultural norms with conﬂicting and competing values 
(Miller et  al. 2017), public lack of knowledge on climate change 
and distrust of information sources (Wynveen and Sutton, 2015), as 
well as populations increasingly distanced from, and unconcerned 
about nature (Romañach et  al. 2018), may constrain ecosystem-
based adaptation response. Examples of governance adaptation 
constraints include: inadequate policy, governance and institutional 
structures (Sánchez-Arcilla et  al. 2016; Miller et  al. 2017; Wigand 
et al. 2017), limited capacity (Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; Thorne et al. 
2017), ineffective implementation (Nguyen et al. 2017; Comte and 
Pendleton, 2018), and poor enforcement (Nguyen et  al. 2017). 
Governance constraints are compounded by lack of ﬁnances (Miller 
et al. 2017), ﬁnancial costs of design and implementation (Gallagher 
et al. 2015) and the high cost of coastal land (Gracia et al. 2018), 
although ecosystem-based adaptation is considered cheaper than 
human-made structures (Nehren et al. 2017; Salgado and Martinez, 
2017; Vikolainen et al. 2017; Gracia et al. 2018).
Knowledge limitations can include a lack of data (Sutton-Grier et al. 
2015; Wigand et al. 2017; Romañach et al. 2018), for example, when 
an absence of baseline data may undermine coastline management 
(Perkins et al. 2015). Scale-relevant information may be required for 
local decision making (Robins et al. 2016; Thorne et al. 2017) and 
to comply with localised design requirements (Vikolainen et  al. 
2017). Other knowledge barriers include inherent uncertainties in 
models (Schaeffer-Novelli et  al. 2016) and complexity of coastal 
systems (Wigand et al. 2017). A more nuanced knowledge barrier is 
the disconnect between scientiﬁc, community and decision making 
processes (Romañach et al. 2018).
Substantial knowledge gaps are reported for ecosystem-based 
adaptation, including restoration of coral reef systems as an 
adaptation tool (Comte and Pendleton, 2018), managing mangrove 
and human response to climate change (Ward et  al. 2016), 
advancing coastal EBA science by quantifying ecosystem services 
(Hernández-González et  al.), and evaluating natural infrastructure 
(Roberts et al. 2017). Few syntheses of the context-speciﬁc application 
and cost-effectiveness of EBA approaches are to be found in the 
literature (Narayan et al. 2016).
Human systems have similar limitations. Improved understanding 
of limitations in built infrastructure, beach nourishment and 
nature-based adaptation responses, especially with respect to 
cost effectiveness and resilience, would substantially aid shoreline 
stabilisation attempts (Mackey and Ware, 2018). For artisanal 
ﬁsheries, a range of physical and socioinstitutional limits and barriers 
to adaptation have been reported, including increasing occurrence 
and severity of storms limiting ﬁshing time, technologically poor 
boats and ﬁshing equipment and lack of access to credit and 
markets, among others (Islam et al. 2013). Conﬂicting interests and 
values of stakeholders (Evans et al. 2016), the path-dependent nature 
of organisations and resistance to change (Evans et al. 2016) and 
inadequate collaboration and public awareness (Oulahen et al. 2018) 
have been reported as socioinstitutional barriers. A knowledge gap 
persists in understanding how such limits and barriers interact to 
suppress adaptation response.
In some communities, climate change may not be prioritised in the 
face of chronic, daily challenges to secure livelihoods (Esteban et al. 
2017; Fischer, 2018) or risk severity may be underestimated due to 
a high frequency of exposure in the recent past (Esteban et al. 2017). 
In a world with competing risks and urgent priorities, some local 
inhabitants appear to be unable to avoid, or are willing to carry, the 
risk associated with a climate impact in order to meet other, more 
pressing needs. This example reﬂects the reality of many poor, informal 
settlement dwellers in coastal areas around the world (medium 
conﬁdence). Other human system barriers to effective adaptation 
action include insufﬁcient climate change knowledge, inappropriate 
coping strategies, high dependency upon natural resources, level of 
exposure to hazards and weak community networks (Islam et  al. 
2013; Nanlohy et al. 2015; Lohmann, 2016; Koya et al. 2017; Senapati 
and Gupta, 2017; Cumiskey et al. 2018).
In summary, it is concluded that the broad range of reported 
barriers and limits to climate change adaptation for ecosystem and 
human system adaptation responses (high conﬁdence). Limitations 
include the space that ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and 
human impacts that need to be addressed as part of the adaptation 
response, the lowering of adaptive capacity of ecosystems because of 
climate change, and slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the 
recurrence of climate impacts, availability of technology, knowledge 
and ﬁnancial support and existing governance structures (medium 
conﬁdence). (5.5.2.5)

Summary
There has been a substantial amount of literature focused on coastal 
and oceanic adaptation since AR5. Socio-institutional adaptation 
responses are the more numerous of the three types of adaptation 
responses assessed in this chapter. There is broad agreement that hard 
engineering responses are optimally supported by ecosystem-based 
adaptation approaches, and both approaches should be augmented 
by socioinstitutional approaches for adaptation (high conﬁdence) 
(Nicholls et al. 2015; Peirson et al. 2015; Sánchez-Arcilla et al. 2016; 
van der Nat et  al. 2016; Francesch-Huidobro et  al. 2017; Khamis 
et  al. 2017). In planning adaptation responses, awareness-raising 
and stakeholder engagement processes are important for buy-in 
and ownership of responses (robust evidence, high agreement) as is 
institutional capacity within local government organisations, whose 
importance in coastal adaptation initiatives has been emphasised 
in the recent literature (robust evidence, high agreement). With all 
three types of adaptation, basic good governance and effective 
implementation of service delivery processes are prerequisites for 
successful adaptation planning and response.
5.5.3 
Governance Across All Scales
There are many global, regional, national and local governance 
structures with interests in climate-driven ocean warming, 
acidiﬁcation, deoxygenation and SLR, and their impacts on marine 
ecosystems and dependent communities (Galland et  al. 2012; 
Stephens, 2015; Fennel and VanderZwaag, 2016; Diamond, 2018). 
The legal, policy and institutional response is therefore shared 
by many institutions developed for a number of distinct but 
inter-related ﬁelds, including governance regimes for ocean systems, 
climate change, marine environment, ﬁsheries and the environment 
generally. A changing ocean poses several scale-related challenges 
for these governance institutions and processes, arising from:
• The global and transboundary scales of the major changes 
to ocean properties (temperature, circulation, oxygen loss, 
acidiﬁcation, etc.), with variability in their local expression;
• The regional scales of changes in ecosystem services following 
from the changes in ocean properties (including services provided 
to humans living far from the coasts); 
• The global scales of land-based drivers of those changes (both 
greenhouse gas emissions and changes in ecosystems services), 
which often motivate policy responses (primarily at the national 
level) and behavioural responses (primarily at the community level); 
• The scale dependent need for coordinated responses by 
the different governance structures, to ensure their overall 
effectiveness (see also Chapter 1).
For all of these challenges, the scales of the climate-related issues 
may be poorly matched to the scales of most governance institutions 
and processes, making effective responses or proactive initiatives 
difﬁcult. Sections 5.2 to 5.4 provide evidence, through case 
histories and thematic overviews, that illustrates these four types 
of challenges. In some cases, more than one type of challenge is 
illustrated in a single example, such as when a change in an amount 
or availability of an ecosystem service is discussed in the context of 
factors inﬂuencing the vulnerability of socio-ecological systems to 
climate change (Sections 5.2., 5.3 and 5.4).
Existing ocean governance structures for the ocean already face 
multi-dimensional challenges because of climate change, and this 
trend of increasing complexity will continue (Galaz et  al. 2012). 
Current international governance regimes and structures for ﬁsheries 
and the ocean environment do not yet adequately address the issues 
of ocean warming, acidiﬁcation and deoxygenation (Oral, 2018; 
Box  5.6). At the time of the initial development and adoption of 
these legal and governance regimes, minimal attention was given 
to climate change and the effects of carbon dioxide emissions on the 
ocean, with associated impacts on the interacting physical, chemical, 
biological properties of the ecosystems, and the resulting risks and 
vulnerabilities of dependent communities and economic sectors. 
In  particular, the governance of ocean ABNJ is a major challenge 
(Levin and Le Bris, 2015); the collaborative structures and mechanisms 
for environmental assessment in ABNJ need further development 
(Warner, 2018) (high conﬁdence). Negotiations are currently ongoing 
regarding a new international agreement for marine biodiversity of 
ABNJ (UNEP, 2016).
The following changes in governance may improve the ability of 
governance institutions and processes to address the challenges 
identiﬁed above:
• Cooperation on regional and global scales through various types 
of agreements of varying degrees of formality for States and 
other participants in governance;
• Increasing the voice and role in decision making for non-
governmental participants such as Indigenous peoples, social 
and labour organisations;
• Increasing the horizontal integration of decision making across 
industry and societal sectors, under processes such as ‘integrated 
management’ and ‘marine spatial planning’; 
• Increasing resource mobilisation at the community scale to 
enable communities to experiment and innovate to address 
the challenges, and then to share their experiences with other 
communities and build cooperative approaches to promote 
strategies with successful outcomes.
These governance innovation strategies have the potential to 
increase the ability of the governance institutions and processes 
to successfully respond to all four types of scale-related challenges 
listed earlier. However, any of them also have the potential to fail 
to address their intended concerns effectively if implemented 
inappropriately, or to create new challenges as the initial priorities 
are addressed. In some countries, lack of capacity of the existing 
governance institutions, lack of access to basic facilities, insufﬁcient 
income diversiﬁcation and illiteracy are major hindrance for 
ocean governance in a changing climate (Bennett et  al. 2014; 
Salik et al. 2015; Weng et al. 2015; Karim and Uddin, 2019; Sarkodie 
and Strezov, 2019) (high conﬁdence).

UNCLOS imposes obligations on state parties to take action to combat the main sources of ocean pollution. Tools and 
techniques in UNCLOS may need adjustment in response to the emerging challenges created by ocean climate change 
(Redgwell, 2012). However, success of the umbrella regulatory framework of UNCLOS depends heavily on the further 
development, modiﬁcation and implementation of detailed regulations by relevant international, regional and national 
institutions (Karim, 2015).
The London Protocol to the London Convention was amended in 2006 to address the issue of carbon dioxide storage 
processes for sequestration. Two subsequent amendments concern sharing transboundary sub-seabed geological 
formations for sequestration projects, and ocean fertilisation and other marine geoengineering. One of these new 
amendments prohibits ocean fertilisation except for research purposes (Dixon et al. 2014).
The issue of ocean acidiﬁcation has been considered within the framework of the OSPAR Convention, the CCAMLR 
Convention (Herr et al. 2014), and the CBD (CBD,2014) ; this issue is discussed further in Box 5.6.
The CBD has also considered regulatory issues relating to ocean fertilisation and other (marine) geoengineering 
(Williamson and Bodle, 2016). In 2018, the CBD adopted Voluntary Guidelines for the Design and Effective Implementation 
of Ecosystem-Based Approaches to Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction. However, even if Parties to the 
Convention choose to adopt the voluntary guidelines, there is no mechanism to implement them beyond their exclusive 
economic zones in the water column and their extended continental shelves (if recognised) in the seabed.
Most of the 29 world heritage listed coral reefs are facing severe heat stress (Heron, 2017) and the WHC may play  
a role for coral reef protection. 
Climate Change 
UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, 
MARPOL Convention and 
other legal instruments 
Existing international legal instruments do not adequately address climate change challenges for the open ocean and 
coastal seas (Galland et al. 2012; Redgwell, 2012; Herr et al. 2014; Magnan et al. 2016; Gallo et al. 2017; Heron, 2017). 
Nevertheless, ocean and coastal areas will beneﬁt from the overall UNFCCC goal for preventing dangerous interference 
with the climate system. A study of the 161 national pledges for climate change mitigation and adaptation (NDCs) identiﬁed 
‘gaps between scientiﬁc [understanding] and government attention, including on ocean deoxygenation, which is barely 
mentioned’ (Gallo et al. 2017).
In 2011, the MARPOL convention was amended to include technical and operational measures for the reduction 
of greenhouse gas emissions from ships. However, the effectiveness of these provisions depends on the national 
implementation by ﬂag, port and coastal states, with no international enforcement authority (Karim, 2015).
Fisheries

Agreement, FAO PSMA, 
Regional Fisheries 
Agreements and other 
legal instruments
The impact of climate change on marine ﬁsheries is expected to be very signiﬁcant (Sections 5.3, 5.4) (Barange et al. 2018; 
FAO, 2019), with adverse impacts on food security, livelihood and national development in many coastal countries; least 
developed countries seem particularly vulnerable (Blasiak et al. 2017). Regional ﬁsheries management systems need to 
address these emerging challenges (Brooks et al. 2013). The ecological and socio-ecological criteria and standards for 
performance can be set at regional levels where Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have been established, but 
their effectiveness is variable depending on the characteristics of regulatory instruments and other factors (Ojea et al. 2017). 
The current international regulatory framework for ﬁsheries management has a responsiveness gap, since it does not fully 
incorporate issues related to the ﬂuctuating and changing distribution of ﬁsheries (Pentz and Klenk, 2017; Pinsky et al. 2018).
However, some regional ﬁsheries management organisations (RFMOs) have initiated processes to improve the equity of 
sharing ﬁshery resources affected by climate change (Aqorau et al. 2018). A climate-informed ecosystem-based ﬁsheries 
governance approach has been suggested for enhancing climate change resilience of marine ﬁsheries in the developing 
world (Heenan et al. 2015), but robust and effective management, policy, legislation and planning based on ﬂexibility and 
scientiﬁc understanding will be required for coastal ﬁsheries (Gourlie et al. 2017). The existing failing condition of many 
stocks, coupled with maladaptive responses to climate change, may create serious challenges for the sustainability of 
global ﬁsheries; improved ﬁsheries governance can offset some of these challenges (Gaines et al. 2018).
The ﬁsheries agreements and the provisions in UNCLOS have helped RFMOs to increase the sustainability of ﬁsheries 
on stocks in or migrating through international waters, and equity of access to them. Because the distribution of many 
stocks changes with changes in physical oceanic conditions (particularly temperature and current regimes), many of the 
measures and access arrangements negotiated and adopted by the RFMOs have reduced effectiveness in a changing 
climate. New arrangements have been difﬁcult to negotiate, in part because of concerns that the distributions and 
productivities will continue to change as climate change continues to drive changes on ocean conditions (Blasiak et al. 
2017; Ojea et al. 2017; Pentz and Klenk, 2017; Aqorau et al. 2018; Pinsky et al. 2018).

Additional considerations identiﬁed by recent studies of ocean 
related mitigation and adaptation include the need for: early 
warning and precautionary management; multi-level and multi-
sectoral governance responses; holistic, integrated and ﬂexible 
management systems; integration of scientiﬁc and local knowledge 
as well as natural, social and economic investigation; identiﬁcation 
and incorporation of a set of social indicators and checklists; adaptive 
governance; and incorporation of climate change effects in marine 
spatial planning (Hiwasaki et al. 2014; Kettle et al. 2014; Hernández-
Delgado, 2015; Himes-Cornell and Kasperski, 2015a; Pittman et al. 
2015; Colburn et al. 2016; Creighton et al. 2016; Hobday et al. 2016a; 
Audefroy and Sánchez, 2017; Gissi et al. 2019; Tuda et al. 2019). Diverse 
adaptations of governance are being tried, and some are producing 
promising results (Sections 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4). However, rigorous 
further evaluation is needed regarding the effectiveness of these 
adaptations in achieving their goals in addressing speciﬁc governance 
challenges. Robust conclusions on the effectiveness of speciﬁc types 
of governance adaptations in various socio-ecological contexts would 
require a targeted assessment of ocean (and terrestrial) governance in 
a changing climate, possible as a key part of AR6. 
Box 5.6 |  Policy Responses to Ocean Acidiﬁcation: Is there an International Governance Gap?
Ocean acidiﬁcation is not speciﬁcally mentioned in the Paris Agreement on climate change (UNFCCC, 2015) and has only been 
given limited attention to date in other UNFCCC discussions. Nevertheless, ocean acidiﬁcation is widely considered to be part of 
the climate system: it is one of seven state-of-the-climate indicators used by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO, 2019); 
it featured strongly in AR5, being covered by both WGI and WGII; its impacts are assessed in many sections of this Chapter; and 
concerns regarding ocean acidiﬁcation have been raised through many international governance structures, including the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP), and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc and Cultural 
Organization (IOC-UNESCO). 
Although many bodies have interests in ocean acidiﬁcation, no unifying treaty or single instrument has been developed (Herr et al. 
2014; Harrould-Kolieb and Hoegh-Guldberg, 2019) and there has been only limited governance action that is speciﬁc to the problem 
(Fennel and VanderZwaag, 2016; Jagers et al. 2018). Exceptions to this generalisation are the development of coordinated monitoring 
through the Global Ocean Acidiﬁcation Observing Network (Newton et al. 2015), with associated scientiﬁc support through the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Osborn et al. 2017; Watson-Wright and Valdés, 2018); and SDG14.3, with its non-binding, 
and relatively general, commitment to ‘minimise and address the impacts of ocean acidiﬁcation, including through enhanced scientiﬁc 
cooperation at all levels’.
One possible response to the fragmented responsibilities for ocean acidiﬁcation governance would be the development of a new 
UN mechanism speciﬁcally to address ocean acidiﬁcation (Kim, 2012). This option would take time and political will, and has not 
been widely supported (Harrould-Kolieb and Herr, 2012). One pragmatic approach could be enhancing the involvement of UNFCCC 
with acidiﬁcation governance (Herr et al. 2014) together with increased use of multilateral environment agreements (Harrould-Kolieb and 
Herr, 2012) (medium conﬁdence). 
UNFCCC action to stabilise the climate by reducing CO2 emissions also necessarily addresses the problem of ocean acidiﬁcation, 
which is primarily caused by anthropogenic CO2 dissolving in seawater and lowering pH. Nevertheless, there are also distinct ocean 
acidiﬁcation mitigation and adaptation issues, including:
• Climate mitigation measures that might be focused on greenhouse gases other than CO2;
• pH-associated thresholds or tipping-points (Hughes et al. 2013; Good et al. 2018) that have implications for scenario-modelling of 
emission reductions (Steinacher et al. 2013);
• The large-scale use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) as a mitigation option, if this involved sub-seaﬂoor CO2 
storage, with risk of leakage and hence ocean acidiﬁcation impacts (Blackford et al. 2014);
• The use of other CO2 removal techniques (negative emissions) such as ocean fertilisation (Section 5.5.1.3), or solar radiation 
management, without CO2 emission reductions; both approaches would worsen ocean acidiﬁcation (Williamson and Turley, 2012; 
Keller et al. 2014a).
Adaptation to climate change could also include a more integrated approach to reduce ocean acidiﬁcation impacts (Section 5.5.2). 
Proposed adaptation actions for ocean acidiﬁcation (Kelly et al. 2011; Billé et al. 2013; Strong et al. 2014; Albright et al. 2016a) include 
reduction of pollution and other stressors (thereby strengthening resilience); water treatment (e.g., for high value aquaculture); and the 
use of seaweed cultivation and seagrass restoration to slow longterm pH changes (although short-term variability may be increased) 
(Sabine, 2018). These measures are generally applicable to relatively limited spatial scales; whilst they may succeed in ‘buying time’, their 
future effectiveness will decrease unless underlying global drivers are also addressed (high conﬁdence).

Changing Ocean, Marine Ecosystems, and Dependent Communities 
Chapter 5

5.6 
Synthesis
This chapter has documented an extraordinary array of observed 
changes in the open ocean, deep sea and coasts. It draws on 
evidence from thousands of references from the literature, millions 
of observations and hundreds of simulations of the past and future 
scenarios. The ocean climate and its state, ecosystems and human 
systems have changed (Section 4.2.2.6, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, Figure 5.24) 
and are projected to change further. The ocean is a highly connected 
environment allowing water and living organisms to move freely. 
Change is observed across physical conditions that pose hazards 
to ecosystems in all regions from the surface to the deepest parts 
(Figure 5.24). All types of human and managed systems that have 
been covered in this chapter have evidence of mostly negative 
impacts but also some positive, some very signiﬁcantly, some less 
so (Figure 5.24). Overall the multiple lines of evidence from the 
literature and the assessment in this chapter’s Executive Summary 
point to profound and pervasive changes on regional and global 
scales (Figure 5.24).
The level of knowledge and conﬁdence of the changes in the marine 
environment that are particularly relevant to ecosystems and 
human systems ranges from virtually certain to low conﬁdence (see 
Figure 5.24). Many of the observed changes in some variables can 
be directly attributed to human inﬂuence from rising greenhouse 
gases and other anthropogenic forcings (Section 5.2.2 and 5.2.3). For 
other variables and in some systems the evidence is less direct, but 
the cascading of risks from changing ocean, marine ecosystems and 
dependent communities remains robust when considered as a whole. 
The observed and projected changes in the ocean systems that are 
covered in this chapter are consistent with our understanding of 
ocean chemistry and circulation, and our knowledge of the ecosystems 
responses. In many cases, the assessments of risk level of ecosystems 
for the recent past and long-term future are based on multiple lines 
of evidence, combining ecological and physiological knowledge (from 
experiments, direct observations and model projections) with the 
major climate drivers (e.g., Sections 5.2.5 and 5.3.4). Globally, all the 
marine ecosystems assessed here have elevated risk for biodiversity, 
ecosystem function, structure and services with increasing greenhouse 
gas emissions (Figure 5.16) (high conﬁdence). These risks result from 
ocean warming, stratiﬁcation, acidiﬁcation, deoxygenation, SLR 
and associated changes as well as interactions with non-climatic 
human drivers. Most importantly, all the coastal ecosystems that 
were assessed, where linkages between natural systems and human

Figure 5.24 |  Synthesis of observed regional hazards and impacts in the ocean assessed in SROCC. For the ocean, physical changes, impacts on key ecosystems, and 
impacts on human systems and ecosystem services are shown. For physical changes, yellow/green refers to an increase/decrease, respectively, in amount or frequency of the 
measured variable. For impacts on ecosystems, human systems and ecosystems services blue or red depicts whether an observed impact is positive (beneﬁcial) or negative 
(adverse), respectively, to the given system or service. Cells assigned ‘increase and decrease’ indicate that within that region, both increases and decreases of physical 
changes are found, but are not necessarily equal; the same holds for cells showing ‘positive and negative’ attributable impacts. For ocean regions, the conﬁdence level 
refers to the conﬁdence in attributing observed changes to changes in greenhouse gas forcing for physical changes and to climate change for ecosystem, human systems, 
and ecosystem services. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at regional scale, or the evidence is insufﬁcient for assessment. The physical changes in the 
ocean are deﬁned as: Temperature change in 0–700 m layer of the ocean except for Southern Ocean (0–2000 m) and Arctic Ocean (upper mixed layer and major inﬂowing 
branches); Oxygen in the 0–1200 m layer or oxygen minimum layer; Ocean pH as surface pH (decreasing pH corresponds to increasing ocean acidiﬁcation). Ecosystems 
in the ocean: Coral refers to warm-water coral reefs and cold-water corals. The ‘upper water column’ category refers to epipelagic zone for all ocean regions except Polar 
Regions, where the impacts on some pelagic organisms in open water deeper than the upper 200 m were included. Coastal wetland includes salt marshes, mangroves 
and seagrasses. Kelp forests are habitats of a speciﬁc group of macroalgae. Rocky shores are coastal habitats dominated by immobile calciﬁed organisms such as mussels 
and barnacles. Deep sea is seaﬂoor ecosystems that are 3000–6000 m deep. Sea-ice associated includes ecosystems in, on and below sea ice. Habitat services refer to 
supporting structures and services (e.g., habitat, biodiversity, primary production). Coastal Carbon Sequestration refers to the uptake and storage of carbon by coastal blue 
carbon ecosystems. Impacts on tourism refer to the operating conditions for the tourism sector. Cultural services include cultural identity, sense of home, and spiritual and 
intrinsic and aesthetic values. The underlying information for ocean regions in Tables SM5.10, SM5.11, SM3.8, SM3.9, and SM3.10. {3.2.1; 3.2.3; 3.2.4; 3.3.3; 3.4.1; 3.4.3;

communities are the strongest, had increased risk, and none saw 
a risk reduction from a warming climate (high conﬁdence).
The observed and projected changes in the open ocean and coastal 
seas have consequences on human communities and affect all aspects 
of well-being and have social, economic and environmental costs 
(Section 5.4, high conﬁdence). The range and diversity of impacts 
is striking, with varying consequences for the wider community 
when analysed across the key marine ecosystems services. These 
consequences clearly affect the capacity for human society to achieve 
the SDGs (e.g., Figure 5.22). The evidence of climate change in the 
ocean is a pervasive thread through all types of coupled human-
natural systems and projections amplify these observed impacts with 
the least impact from lower emission scenarios. 
Risk-reduction responses and their governance through adaptation 
at the local scale are the most common responses to climate change 
from ocean systems (Section 5.5.2). It is clear that there are many 
choices for reducing risk of climate change. Many of the actions 
have beneﬁts and relatively few dis-beneﬁts, while others have large 
dis-beneﬁts and marginal effectiveness (Section 5.5.1, Figure 5.23, 
Table 5.7 and Table 5.8). Many of the risk reduction approaches are 
limited in their capacity to reduce the risks of climate change, or are at 
best temporary solutions, which is a signiﬁcant challenge to adapting 
to climate change (high conﬁdence). In particular, the effectiveness 
of the assessed risk reduction measures are minimal under high 
greenhouse gas emission scenarios, highlighting the critical 
importance of mitigation. The assessment points to the  increased 
effectiveness and importance of a portfolio of different types of 
mitigation and adaptation options. Governance is also a critical 
element in the portfolio of options and occurs at local, national and 
international scales. Such responses can be more effective with the 
support of scientiﬁc information, Local knowledge and Indigenous 
knowledge, and the consideration of local context and the inclusion 
of stakeholders.
5.7 
Key Uncertainties and Gaps
This chapter was designed around three guiding questions 
(Section 5.1). These guiding questions mean that the report covers 
both regional and global scales of the ocean and many aspects 
of human systems, including governance and institutions, and 
adaptation pathways for dependent communities. This assessment 
is new linking together a broad and complex set of ocean disciplines 
and therefore also provides a unique perspective on key uncertainties 
and  gaps in these systems. These gaps limit the extent of the 
assessments that were possible in this report. Notable outstanding 
uncertainties and gaps from this assessment include the following:
Physical and biogeochemical processes: While the Earth system 
is better monitored and the relevant data are more accessible than 
the other areas of assessment there is considerable room to improve 
these capabilities. For example, gaps remain in predictive modelling 
of climate change in coastal areas, deep ocean temperature and 
salinity measurements for sea level and closure of the energy budget, 
and oxygen and carbon measurements dense enough to measure 
deoxygenation of the world ocean and track the mechanisms driving 
the ocean carbon cycle. Our capacity to understand and model 
net primary productivity and the rates of carbon burial in coastal 
sediments are also signiﬁcant weaknesses. Projections of future 
changes in the Earth system depend on the use of ESMs, in which 
there are uncertainties arising from physical or ecological processes 
that are either omitted or incompletely understood. Most ESMs still 
rely on relatively simple representations of ocean biogeochemical 
cycling and the linkages to ocean ecosystem structure and function 
(Section 5.2.3). Other examples of under-assessed biogeochemical 
process in the ocean that may have implications for the Earth system 
under climate change include the fate of methane in the deep ocean 
(Section 5.2.4). Open ocean primary productivity and its projections 
requires critical corroborating measurements and improved 
understanding of its drivers to project changes in ocean productivity 
with higher conﬁdence (Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3).
Biological processes and monitoring: There are a number of 
marine environments (e.g.,  on the deep sea ﬂoor) and ecosystem 
components (e.g., viruses and protists) where insufﬁcient scientiﬁc 
understanding limits the assessments of risks to low conﬁdence 
or no assessment. Examples of gaps include the narrow range of 
climate and non-climatic hazards and their interactions in simulation 
models, the linkages between single organisms to communities of 
organisms, knowledge of climate feedbacks in biological systems 
(Section 5.3.4, Section 5.2.4), and the capacity and limits of biological 
adaptation for many ecosystems (Section 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.3). 
Increasing observational capacity can help provide the data to 
improve understanding and modelling of these important biophysical 
responses to climate change.
Variance in human systems and effectiveness of responses: The 
wide range of contributing factors (physical, social and economic) 
that interact with localised climate projections make projecting 
site-speciﬁc costs of impacts and beneﬁts of adaptation difﬁcult. 
There were few examples in the literature evaluating implemented 
adaptation actions, and there was low conﬁdence in their reliability 
and provenance, thus largely precluding any assessments of their cost 
effectiveness. This lack of evidence on costs and beneﬁts particularly 
affected assessments in Section 5.4 and 5.5. Adaptation responses to 
climate change have been undertaken by communities, industry and 
governments. However, their effectiveness for mitigating the risks of 
climate change (e.g., different types of adaptation response on the 
coasts, Section 5.5.2) is largely unassessed here, and consequently 
precludes a global understanding of the capacity in the world to 
address the risks of climate change in coastal seas, open ocean and 
the deep sea. A partial solution would be establishing an appropriate 
ocean and coasts database, including costs-beneﬁts, for these types 
of studies.

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 5.1 |  How is life in the sea affected by climate change?
Climate change poses a serious threat to life in our seas, including coral reefs and ﬁsheries, with impacts on 
marine ecosystems, economies and societies, especially those most dependent upon natural resources. The risk 
posed by climate change can be reduced by limiting global warming to no more than 1.5ºC.
Life in most of the global ocean, from pole to pole and from sea surface to the abyssal depths, is already 
experiencing higher temperatures due to human-driven climate change. In many places, that increase may be 
barely measurable. In others, particularly in near-surface waters, warming has already had dramatic impacts 
on marine animals, plants and microbes. Due to closely linked changes in seawater chemistry, less oxygen 
remains available (in a process called ocean deoxygenation). Seawater contains more dissolved carbon dioxide, 
causing ocean acidiﬁcation. Non-climatic effects of human activities are also ubiquitous, including over-ﬁshing 
and pollution. Whilst these stressors and their combined effects are likely to be harmful to almost all marine 
organisms, food-webs and ecosystems, some are at greater risk (FAQ5.1, Figure 1). The consequences for human 
society can be serious unless sufﬁcient action is taken to constrain future climate change.
Warm water coral reefs host a wide variety of marine life and are very important for tropical ﬁsheries and other 
marine and human systems. They are particularly vulnerable, since they can suffer high mortalities when water 
temperatures persist above a threshold of between 1ºC–2ºC above the normal range. Such conditions occurred 
in many tropical seas between 2015 and 2017 and resulted in extensive coral bleaching, when the coral animal 
hosts ejected the algal partners upon which they depend. After mass coral mortalities due to bleaching, reef 
recovery typically takes at least 10–15 years. Other impacts of climate change include SLR, acidiﬁcation and reef 
erosion. Whilst some coral species are more resilient than others, and impacts vary between regions, further reef 
degradation due to future climate change now seems inevitable, with serious consequences for other marine 
and coastal ecosystems, like loss of coastal protection for many islands and low-lying areas and loss of the high 
biodiversity these reefs host. Coral habitats can also occur in deeper waters and cooler seas, and more research is 
needed to understand impacts in these reefs. Although these cold water corals are not at risk from bleaching, due 
to their cooler environment, they may weaken or dissolve under ocean acidiﬁcation, and other ocean changes.

Mobile species, such as ﬁsh, may respond to climate change by moving to more favorable regions, with populations 
shifting poleward or to deeper water, to ﬁnd their preferred range of water temperatures or oxygen levels. As 
a result, projections of total future ﬁshery yields under different climate change scenarios only show a moderate 
decrease of around 4% (~3.4 million tonnes) per degree Celsius warming. However, there are dramatic regional 
variations. With high levels of climate change, ﬁsheries in tropical regions could lose up to half of their current 
catch levels by the end of this century. Polar catch levels may increase slightly, although the extent of such gains 
is uncertain, because ﬁsh populations that are currently depleted by overﬁshing and subject to other stressors 
may not be capable of migrating to polar regions, as assumed in models.
In polar seas, species adapted to life on or under sea ice are directly threatened by habitat loss due to climate 
change. The Arctic and Southern Oceans are home to a rich diversity of life, from tiny plankton to ﬁsh, krill and 
seaﬂoor invertebrates to whales, seals, polar bears or penguins. Their complex interactions may be altered if 
new warmer-water species extend their ranges as sea temperatures rise. The effects of acidiﬁcation on shelled 
organisms, as well as increased human activities (e.g., shipping) in ice-free waters, can amplify these disruptions. 
Whilst some climate change impacts (like possible increased catch levels in polar regions) may beneﬁt humans, 
most will be disruptive for ecosystems, economies and societies, especially those that are highly dependent upon 
natural resources. However, the impacts of climate change can be much reduced if the world as a whole, through 
inter-governmental interventions, manages to limit global warming to no more than 1.5ºC.
