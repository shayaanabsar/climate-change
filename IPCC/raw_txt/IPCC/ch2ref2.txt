Typical default values for Norwegian plants for C (carbon content in coke) are 97 per
cent and for S (sequestered carbon in product), 35 per cent.  This implies a typical
emission factor of 2.3 tonnes CO2/tonne coke.
More carbon is actually needed in the process than calculated from a stoichiometric
reaction.  The suggested emission factors are calculated from coke input in Norwegian
plants.  The excess carbon is oxidised during the process, little is left as ash (Raaness,
1991).
The petrol coke used in this process may contain volatile compounds which will form
methane.  Some of this methane will escape to the atmosphere, particularly during the
start up.  Measurements at Norwegian plants suggest emission factors of 10.2 kg/tonne
petrol coke or 11.6 kg/tonne carbide product.

Calcium carbide is made by heating calcium carbonate and subsequently reducing CaO
with carbon (e.g., petrol coke).  Both steps lead to emissions of CO2.  Some carbon will
be sequestered in the product.  The most important application of calcium carbide is
producing acetylene.  Consequently, the sequestering will be for a short time only (less
than a few years) and may be disregarded.  On the other hand Ca(OH)2 is produced as a
by-product in the acetylene production.  This Ca(OH)2 will react with CO2 to form
CaCO3.  Hence, the CO2 emitted from the limestone may be said to be recycled.
Production of CaC2:
CaCO3  →  CaO + CO2
CaO + 3C  →  CaC2 + CO (→ CO2)
Use of carbide:
CaC2 + 2H2O  →  Ca(OH) 2 + C2H2  →  2CO2
The CO gas will in most plants be utilised as energy.  1.8 tonnes CO2/tonne calcium
carbide will be released in the production process.  In addition, 1.1 tonnes CO2/tonne
calcium carbide will be released when the carbide is used.  The CO2 emissions may be
lowered by utilising the gas when producing dicyanodiamide from carbide (Olsen 1991).
Limestone contains about 98 per cent CaCO3.  1750 kg limestone (or 950 kg CaO) and
640 kg reducing agent (including 20 kg carbon electrodes) are required to produce 1
tonne carbide.
Emissions may be calculated from the use of raw materials (limestone and coke) or from
the production.

The theoretical emission factor calculated from a stoichiometric reaction is 1.37 tonne
CO2/tonne carbide (for the carbonate and coke step).  Excess carbon is however
oxidised in the process.  The suggested emission factors are calculated from the actual
use of raw materials in a Norwegian plant.  The emission factor for acetylene use is
calculated from the actual (not stoichiometric) carbon content of carbide.
Also note that the CaO (lime) might be produced at another plant than the carbide plant.
In this case, the emissions from the CaO step should be reported as emissions from lime
production (Section 2.4) and only the emissions from the reduction step and use of
product should be reported as emissions from calcium carbide production.

Emission methods have not yet been developed for the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook.
SO2 is potentially emitted from the production processes due to sulphur in the raw coke
material.
Silicon carbide: The emissions are most accurately calculated from the consumption of
coke, the sulphur content of the coke, and the degree of control.  In addition, CO is
emitted due to incomplete oxidation of carbon coke.  An emission factor of 0.4 tonne
CO/tonne petrol coke has been determined for Norway (Rosland 1987), but this factor
will be highly plant specific.
Calcium carbide: Nearly 100 per cent of the SO2 potentially emitted will be sequestered
in the product (Rypdal 1995, Rosland 1987).  An emission factor of 1.5 kg SO2/tonne
coke is given in U.S. EPA 1995, but no experimental methods or assumptions are given.
CO is generated in the process, but is usually oxidised in the process, used as a fuel or
flared.  This should be checked for the relevant plants.

Production of chemicals other than nitric acid and adipic acid may be sources of nitrous
oxide, but more studies are needed to determine whether they represent a significant
source of N2O.  Production of caprolactam, acrylonitrile, and catalytic cracking of oil, may
be significant sources.  Generally, suggested sources are related to either a process using
a N-compound or a catalytic reduction step.  Compared to emissions associated with

adipic acid and nitric acid production, the N2O emissions from this source category will
probably be small.
Caprolactam is a widely used chemical intermediate.  Most of the 3 million tonnes
produced per year is used in the production of nylon-6 (Fisher and Crescenti, 1994).
Different methods are used for the manufacture of caprolactam.  They are all based on
catalytic oxidation of ammonia.  In the Netherlands, caprolactam production was
identified as a significant industrial source of N2O (Kroeze, 1994).
In order to increase the yield of gasoline from oil, certain fractions from the oil are
treated in a catcracker.  Crude oil contains some nitrogen, and the nitrous oxide
emissions from the cracking process may be significant.  Depending on the regional
market for light and medium-light oil products, catalytic cracking is more or less
important in a specific region.  A few studies on emissions from this source have been
performed in the Netherlands but presently data are not available to suggest a
methodology (Oonk, 1996).
Therefore, a general recommended method for estimation of N2O emissions from these
sources is not given here.

Although most methane sources from industrial processes individually are small,
collectively they may be significant.
Chemical manufacturing processes, e.g., carbon black, ethylene, dichloroethylene, styrene
and methanol, are potential sources of methane.  However, sources other than those
mentioned here may be of importance.
Few data on emissions are presently available.  These are presented in Table 2-10:

This section is concerned with emissions from small point sources.  However, total
emissions from these sources may be important.  Only a simple methodology is suggested
here.  It should be noted that some of these sources may be individually very important in
certain countries.  In these cases a more detailed methodology should be used, based on
plant specific data.  The EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook and the U.S. EPA guidelines should
be consulted for advise on detailed methodologies and process descriptions.
A summary of default emission factors and ranges is given in Table 2-11.  Ranges given for
VOC emissions from many processes are quite large.  Emission factors are likely to be
quite process specific.  For instance, polystyrene is manufactured in various grades by
batch or continuous process.  Higher emission factors are associated with the lower
molecular weight of polystyrenes.  The variation in emission factors from plants using the
continuous process is quite large, depending upon the type of vacuum system employed
(U.S. EPA 1995).
Evaporative emissions from petrochemical industries may be higher in warm than in
temperate countries.

With a few exceptions, commercial production of metals from ores requires the use of
carbon as a reducing agent.  If the ore contains carbonate, CO2 originating from the ore
will also be emitted during production.  On the other hand, carbon may also be
sequestered in the metal.
The metal may be reduced by using coal, coke, prebaked anodes and coal electrodes.
Wood chips and charcoal may also be used in some of the processes, but the resulting
CO2 emissions are not counted in Chapter 2 as net emissions.  These net emissions of
CO2 should, however, be reported in the Land-Use Change and Forestry Chapter.  Coke
is produced from coal or refinery residuals (petrol coke).  Prebaked anodes and
electrodes are produced from coal.  By-product fuel (coke oven gas and blast furnace gas)
are produced in some of the processes.  These fuels may be sold or used within the plant.
They may or may not be included in the national energy balance.  Care should
consequently be taken not to double count emissions.
The following general formula may be used to estimate the emissions:
Mass Reducing Agent x Emission Factor + (Carbon ore - Carbon metal) x 3.67  = Emission (tonnes CO2)
The first part of this formula (the amount of reducing agent used combined with an
emission factor) will usually be most important and probably be sufficient for making a
first estimate of the emissions.
The emission factors in Table 2-12 are suggested as default.

In addition, CO2 will be emitted from baking (prebaked anodes).  In the aluminium
industry about 5 per cent of the non-combustion CO2 emissions using the prebaking
technology will be from baking.  No data is available for other metal industries using
prebaked anodes.

Production of most metals may generate emissions of SO2, CO, NOx and NMVOC.
Emissions of SO2 originate from sulphur in the reducing agents and in the ores.  The
emissions will also depend on control technologies and the extent to which sulphur is
sequestered in the products.
NOx is produced primarily by the high temperate oxidisation of nitrogen in air.  In metal
production, most NOx emissions usually occur as a result of fuel combustion.  However,
high temperate metal production processes (such as roasting and reduction), which occur
in the presence of air, will also produce nitrogen oxides.  These NOx emissions are in
principle included in this section, but are often impossible to distinguish from the fuel
NOx.
CO is formed due to incomplete oxidation of the reducing carbon.  This CO may in many
plants be used as a fuel, and double counting of emissions already counted as energy must
be avoided.
In addition, small amounts of NMVOCs may be emitted during parts of some of the
processes, especially those involving coal.

Iron is produced through the reduction of iron oxide (ore) using metallurgical coke as the
reducing agent in a blast furnace.  Steel is then subsequently made from iron and scrap in
other furnaces.
This sector includes two types of facilities.  Large integrated primary iron and steel plants
have coking, smelting and refining capacities to produce steel from raw coal and iron ore.
Other, smaller plants produce iron and steel from coke generated off-site.  The coke
oven used at an integrated plant is identical to that used at off-site coking facilities.  In the
integrated plant, coke oven gases (COGs) are used both for oven under firing and
combustion in the blast furnace and other parts of the process.
Common to all plants is a blast furnace, which reduces raw ore to molten pig iron by
heating in the presence of carbon and oxygen.  Coke, the source of carbon, has been
estimated to be consumed at a rate of about 450 kg/tonne of hot metal (Rankin and
Wright, 1992).  “Flux” in the form of limestone (CaCO3) or dolomite is also added to the
furnace at a rate of about 250 kg/tonne of iron (U.S. EPA 1986).
Steel may be produced in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF), an electric arc furnace (EAF), an
induction furnace or an open hearth furnace.  The open hearth type is the oldest
technology.  Low carbon steel is produced in a BOF, where a mixture of pig iron and iron
scrap is remelted in the presence of pure oxygen, which oxidises the dissolved carbon to
carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.  Carbon and alloy steels are produced in an EAF, a
refractory-lined pot which utilises electric heating through graphite electrodes which are
consumed in the process.  This type is charged with 100 per cent scrap iron.

Process emissions of carbon dioxide in an iron and steel plant take place primarily as a
result of coke oxidisation. Additional emissions occur as the limestone flux gives off
carbon dioxide during reduction of pig iron in the blast furnace, but this source is
covered as emissions from limestone use (Section 2.5).
During steel production, CO2 emissions also take place as a result of graphite electrode
consumption in the EAF.
Pig iron (impure iron) contains about 4-4.5 per cent carbon by weight.  In the conversion
of pig iron to steel the carbon content is reduced to below 2 per cent by weight.  The
process takes place in a steel furnace which has been charged with pig iron, usually
recycled iron or steel and alloying elements to improve material properties.  As the
carbon is removed from the pig iron, CO2 and CO are evolved.  The lost CO-carbon is
eventually converted to carbon dioxide by combustion.  This should not be considered as
an energy emission, as it is inherently part of the iron reduction process.  Care should be
taken not to double count these emissions (when performing the energy balance).
The most accurate methodology is to calculate the emissions from the amount of
reducing agent used as described in 2.13.1.
Parsons (1977) and ORTECH (1994) have studied the consumption of carbon at iron and
steel production facilities.  These results have been summarised by Environment Canada
(1996).  Emission factors per unit iron or steel produced are shown in Table 2-13.

Emissions from iron and steel may originate from various stages of the production
process.
Iron production:
• Blast Furnace Charging: Primary iron production in smelters.  No process emission
factors are given in the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (SNAP 40202).  In the CASPER
model (CASPER 1995) emission factors of NMVOC are given as 100 g/tonne product
(range 20-200) and CO is given as 1330 g/tonne product (range 1180-20000).

Preliminary research from Environment Canada suggests that sulphur dioxide emissions
from the blast furnace may be 1000-3000 g SO2/tonne of iron produced.
• Pig Iron Tapping: This involves the removal of the molten pig iron from the smelter.
While it does give rise to emissions of a range of heavy metals, according to the
EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook no appreciable emissions of the four gases occur.  In the
CASPER model (CASPER 1995) the following emission factors are given: SO2: 30 g/tonne
product, NOx: 76 g/tonne product, CO: 112 g/tonne product and NMVOC: 20 g/tonne
product.
Steel production:
• Open Hearth Furnace: Steel is produced in the open hearth furnace fired by gas or
fuel oil.  No data exist for process emission from open hearth furnaces.
• Basic Oxygen Furnace Steel Plant: Pure oxygen is blown into the furnace via a lance.
Burning CO maintains exothermic conditions.  Most CO emissions are therefore
eliminated.  The EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (SNAP 40206) provides no emission
factors for the gases.
• Electric Furnace Steel Plant: This type of furnace is usually charged with 100 per cent
scrap iron.  Graphite electrodes conduct current through the metal to heat the charge.
Emissions are dependent upon the quality of scrap metal and operating conditions.  The
EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (SNAP 40207) does not give any emission factors for the
gases of interest.
Steel processing:
• Rolling Mills: Rolling mills use a range of different processes and emit differing amounts
of pollutants according to the specific processes used.  Most of the emissions from rolling
mills are from the fuel used to heat the process.  However cold-rolling will emit a range
of gases in addition to the fuel combustion emissions.  The emission factors expressed as
the amount of steel cold rolled are taken from the EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook (SNAP
40208) and are shown in Table 2-14.  Note that SO2, NO2 and CO emission factors are
only given for process smelter gas (as sometimes used for rolling pretreatment).

Ferroalloy is the term used to describe concentrated alloys of iron and one or more
metals such as silicon, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium and tungsten.
These alloys are used for deoxidising and altering the material properties of steel.
Ferroalloy facilities manufacture concentrated compounds which are delivered to steel
production plants to be incorporated in alloy steels.  Ferroalloy production involves a
metallurgical reduction process which results in significant carbon dioxide emissions.
In ferroalloy production, raw ore, coke and slagging materials are smelted together under
high temperature.  A commonly used technology is the submerged-arc open-top electric
furnace (EAF) (Environment Canada, 1983; Ontario Research Foundation, 1981).  In the
EAF, heating is accomplished by passing current through graphite electrodes suspended in
a cup-shaped, refractory-lined steel shell.  Carbon reduction of the metallic oxides occurs
as both coke and graphite electrodes are consumed.
During ferroalloy smelting, the reduction reaction takes place at a high temperature.
Carbon captures the oxygen from the metal oxides to form CO, while the ores are
reduced to molten base metals.  The component metals then combine in the solution.
For example, the following reaction occurs in the production of 50 per cent ferrosilicon
(AWMA, 1993):
Fe2O3 + 2 SiO2 + 7C  →  2FeSi + 7CO
Primary emissions in covered arc furnaces consist almost entirely of CO as opposed to
CO2, due to the strong reducing environment (ORTECH, 1994).  All CO is assumed,
however, to be converted to CO2 within days afterwards.

The most accurate methodology is to calculate the emissions from the amount of
reducing agent used as described in Section 2.13.1.  Alternatively, the emissions may be
calculated from the production volume.  However, it is impossible to suggest default
factors for this process.  Ferroalloy production may more or less be based on biological
carbon (wood and wood waste).  To the extent that the biocarbon is replaced and that
electricity is produced from e.g., hydro power, the production of ferroalloys may in
principle be CO2 free.  However, in most countries a production based on biocarbon
only will not be economical feasible.  The suggested emission factors (Table 2.15) assume
(if not otherwise specified) that all carbon is fossil and are derived from a material balance
made by SINTEF (SINTEF 1991a) and Streibel (1974).

Sulphur may be sequestered in the products.  For ferromanganese and silicon manganese
98-99 per cent of the sulphur from ore and coke will be sequestered.  Of the remaining
ferroalloys, assume 5 per cent of the sulphur is sequestered (Rypdal 1995, Rosland 1987).
In the CASPER model (CASPER 1995) a factor of 35 g/tonne product has been suggested
for ferrosilicon.
NOx will originate from production of ferrosilicon and silicon metal.  A factor of
11.7 kg/tonne product has been determined (Rypdal 1995).  However, this factor is highly
uncertain, and there may also be emissions from the production of other ferroalloys. In
the CASPER model (CASPER 1995) 0.05 kg/tonne has been suggested.
The emissions of NMVOC originate from coal or coke.  The emissions are calculated
from the consumption of coal and coke.  An emission factor of 1.7 kg/tonne is suggested
(Rypdal 1995).
The U.S. EPA has published uncontrolled CO emission factors for various ferroalloy
products (U.S. EPA 1985).  These vary with furnace type.  Some of these factors are
presented in Table 2-16.

Primary aluminium is produced in two steps.  First bauxite ore is ground, purified and
calcined to produce alumina.  Following this, the alumina is electrically reduced to
aluminium by smelting in large pots.
During the reduction process, the aluminium smelting pot acts as the electrolysis cell.
The pot itself, a shallow steel container, forms the cathode, while the anode consists of
one or more carbon blocks suspended in it.  In the pot, alumina (Al2O3), is dissolved in a
fluoride bath consisting primarily of cryolite, Na3AlF6.  Passing electrolysis current
through the cell also causes a heating effect through the resistance of the cell which
maintains the electrolyte in a liquid state.
Molten aluminium is evolved while the anode is consumed in the reaction.  However, the
carbon functions as a fuel cell and as such substitutes electrical energy consumption.  The
aluminium forms at the cathode and gathers on the bottom of the pot.  The favoured
gaseous reaction product is CO2:
Al2O3 + 3/2C  →  2Al + 3/2 CO2
Most carbon dioxide is evolved from the reaction of the carbon anode with alumina, but
some is formed as the anode reacts with other sources of oxygen (especially air).  This
occurs during cell operation and, in the case of prebaked electrodes, during anode
production at the aluminium plant.
Three types of reduction cells are in use: prebaked anode, horizontal stud S;derberg
anode and vertical stud S;derberg anode.  Prebaked anodes have been preferred over
S;derberg cells during the last 20 years because they are more productive and efficient
with respect to electrical energy consumption and emit fewer organic compounds (U.S.
EPA 1995).

CO2 are suggested in Table 2-17 based on SINTEF 1991b and ORTECH 1994.  The
production and use of carbon anodes for aluminium smelting is a very well established
process.  Evidence suggests that there is little variation in CO2 emissions from plants
utilising similar technologies.  It is very likely that use of the appropriate emission factor,
along with the correct activity data, will produce accurate estimates.

Two PFCs, carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and carbon hexafluoride (C2F6), are known to be
emitted from the process of primary aluminium smelting.
Aluminium is smelted in large  pots by an electrolytic reduction process using carbon
electrodes.  The pot itself forms the cathode, while the anode consists of one or more
carbon blocks.  During production, alumina (Al2O3) is dissolved in a fluoride melt
consisting primarily of cryolite, Na3AlF6.  PFCs are formed during a phenomenon known
as the Anode Effect (AE), when alumina levels are low.  A forced reaction results when
molten fluoride salts at high temperature combine with carbon at the anode to favour the
formation of CF4 and C2F6.  This occurs because, during an AE, voltage rises to a level
greater than that corresponding to the Gibbs energy of formation for these gases (Laval
University, 1994).
When the melt becomes depleted of alumina (reduction to a level of 1.5-2.0 wt %), the
AE occurs and the cell voltage rises from the normal value of 4-5 volts to 20-50 volts.
This happens very suddenly and, in theory, is due to a sudden increase in electrical
resistance across the anode-bath interface.  As a result, the voltage rises to continue
delivering current across the higher resistance.  Competing reactions begin to occur to
produce CO, CF4 and C2F6 in addition to CO2.  It is believed that the carbon anode
becomes completely covered by gas during the AE.  The two reactions of interest at this
point are:
Na3AlF6 + 3/4C  =  Al + 3NaF + 3/4CF4
Na3AlF6 + C  =   Al + 3NaF + 1/2C2F6
The overall anode gas composition below the anode during an anode effect may be
approximately 15 % wt CF4, 20 wt % CO2, 65 wt % CO and 1 wt % C2F6 (Thonstad,
Oygard and Diep, 1994).  AEs typically occur between 0.3 to 3 times daily on a given cell
and last on the order of 2 to 20 minutes (Unisearch, 1994).

Measured Emission Data
In 1992, the Norwegian aluminium industry measured the emissions of PFCs from their
smelters.  The measurements in production cells were performed with a photoacoustic
gas monitor (Norsk Hydro, 1996), (See Table 2-19).  The results were different for
prebaked lines (0.02 to 0.18 kg CF4/tonne Al) and Søderberg lines  (0.15 to
0.9 kg CF4/tonne Al).

In Australia, all aluminium smelters use pre-baked cell technology.  Emission factors from
the Australian aluminium industry are reported to be 0.53 kg CF4/tonne Al, and 0.05 kg
C2F6/tonne Al (Workbook, Australia, 1995).
A study of Canadian aluminium plants found CF4 emission factors to be between 0.045
and 1.2 kg. per tonne of aluminium produced (Unisearch, 1994).  The emission factor for
C2F6 was between 0.007 and 0.14 kg per tonne.  The Canadian study further subdivided
the Søderberg and Prebaked technologies into two separate categories (Table 2-19).  This
subdivision narrows the emission range for each category.
PFC emissions increase with frequency, intensity and duration of anode effects.  The
Norwegian study reported the frequency variation to be 0.03-0.24 AE per cell-day in
Prebaked lines, and 1.0-2.76 AE per cell-day in Søderberg lines.  Canadian data show AE
frequency to vary between 0.2 and 2.6 per cell-day in all lines.  Uncertainty in all
measurements is relatively high (of the order of 50 per cent).
Estimated Emission Data
A preliminary U.S. EPA study suggested a range of 0.01 to 1.2 kg of CF4 per tonne of
aluminium produced by any technology (U.S. EPA, 1994a).  This range is an average based
on measured emissions from aluminium smelters in the United States, Canada and
Norway.  These values may underestimate emissions from other aluminium producing
regions.
CICERO (1992) and, Khalil and Rasmussen (1985) have studied trends in atmospheric
CF4.  The studies made projections based on the assumption that all atmospheric CF4
originates from aluminium production.  Though data are subject to large uncertainties,
both papers lead to the conclusion that the average emission rate from aluminium
smelting is around 1 kg per tonne metal.
The global emissions of PFCs to the atmosphere from all aluminium smelters was re-
estimated for 1995 (Harnisch and Borchers, 1995), and reported to be closer to 1.4 kg
CF4/per tonne Al, and 0.2 kg C2F6/per tonne Al (Tabereaux, 1995).  The distribution of
four different cell technologies on a global scale is given in Table 2-20, together with
estimated CF4 emissions.

Calculation of Emission Data
Tabereaux (1995) has proposed a method for PFC emission calculation.  He states that
the generation of CF4 in electrolysis cells follows Faraday’s Law (i.e., the quantity of gas
generated depends on the flow of electrical current in the cell).  At 100 per cent
efficiency, 13.68 g of CF4 is formed for every kiloampere-minute (kA min) duration of the
anode effect.  For example, CF4 emissions for an aluminium smelter having an average
percentage (p) of 16 per cent CF4 in pot gas during anode effects (AE), 91 per cent
current efficiency (CE) for aluminium production, 0.5 anode effects per pot day (AEF),
and anode effect duration (AED) of 2.5 minutes can be calculated from:
   Kg CF4 / tonne Al  =    (kg CF4/kA min) / (kg Al/kA min) x (1000
kg/tonne) x (p/CE) x AEF x AED
                        =      13.68 / 8.05) x (0.16 / 0.91) x (0.5) x (2.5)

Measurements
Since emissions of CF4 and C2F6 vary so significantly from one aluminium smelter to the
next, depending on cell type and AE parameters, the estimations will be highly uncertain
unless actual emission measurements have been made.  Every effort should be made to
obtain such data.

Calculations
It is recognised that measurements are both expensive and time-consuming.  It may,
however, be much easier to make a limited survey of AE frequency and duration at
smelters.  In such cases, it is recommended that specific CF4 emissions for anode effects
longer than 2 minutes are calculated as follows:

It is recommended that the default rate for C2F6 emissions be 1/10 that of CF4.
Estimations
It is recommended that estimates are used only when no measured data exist.  Specific
emission factors should be chosen according to the type of technology used as shown in
Tables 2-19 and 2-20 and applied to national primary aluminium production data for each
technology.  The following method may then be used to give an estimate of the annual
CF4 emissions from a smelter with a given cell technology.
CF4 emission (kg)  =  EF(tech) (kg CF4/tonne Al) x pp(tech) (tonnes)

This includes production of all non-ferrous metals except aluminium.  The metals may be
produced using carbon as reducing agents or by other methodologies.
Whether carbon is emitted or not depends on the production process.  Some ores are
not reduced with carbon.  Hence, CO2 emissions from these processes are low.  The
general methodology suggested, where emissions are calculated from the consumption of
reducing agents and the carbon content of ores, is recommended.  An overview of
production processes is given in Table 2-21.  Some metals may be produced from
alternative production methods.

In the magnesium industry, SF6 is used as a cover gas in foundries to prevent oxidation of
molten magnesium.  The Norwegian producer of magnesium has assessed whether SF6
used as a cover gas reacts with other components in the furnaces.  The results so far
indicate that SF6 is quite inert.  For the time being it is therefore assumed that all SF6
used as cover gas is emitted to the atmosphere.  The consumption figures are therefore
used as emission estimates.

Pulp and paper production has three major processing steps: pulping, bleaching and paper
production.  The type of pulping and the amount of bleaching used depend on the nature
of the feedstock and the desired quality of the end product.  Kraft (sulphate) pulping is
the most widely used pulping process and is typically used to produce strong paper
products.  The Kraft pulping process includes bleaching, chemical recovery and by-
product recovery.
Sulphite pulping is another chemical pulping process.  It produces a weaker paper than
some other types of pulping, but the pulp is less coloured, making it more suitable for
printing, often with little bleaching.

Only data for the Kraft and Acid sulphite processes are available.
In the Kraft pulping process sodium sulphide and sodium hydroxide are used to
chemically dissolve the lignin that binds the cellulose fibres.  Emission factors are based on
the production of air-dried pulp and are shown in Table 2-22 as suggested in the
EMEP/CORINAIR Guidebook.  The emissions of SO2 may be lower in new mills than the
older ones (U.S. EPA 1995).

The acid sulphite pulping process is similar to the Kraft process except that a sulphurous
acid solution is used to dissolve the lignin in the wood.  This solution is buffered by the
use of bisulphide of sodium, magnesium, calcium or ammonium.  SO2 is considered to be
the major pollutant.  There are at least four types of processes: ammonium based (NH3),
calcium based (Ca), magnesium based (MgO) and sodium based (Na) (U.S. EPA, 1995).
