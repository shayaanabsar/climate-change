FLOODED LAND 
Flooded Lands are defined in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Wetlands) as 
water bodies where human activities have caused changes in the amount of surface area covered by water, 
typically through water level regulation. Here, we also consider: i) waterbodies where human activities have 
changed the hydrology of existing natural waterbodies thereby altering water residence times and/or sedimentation 
rates, in turn causing changes to the natural flux of greenhouse gases (See A7.1.1); and ii) waterbodies that have 
been created by excavation, such as canals, ditches and ponds. Flooded Lands include waterbodies with seasonally 
variable degrees of inundation but would be expected to retain some inundated area throughout the year under 
normal conditions. Seasonally flooded wetlands such as riparian floodplain wetlands are not considered here; 
where these have been modified by human activity, emissions may be estimated using the methods described in 
the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands (2013 
Wetlands Supplement, (IPCC 2014)). The range of Flooded Land considered in this chapter are listed in Table 7.7.

CH4 
Flooded Land emits CO2, CH4 and N2O in significant quantities, depending on a variety of characteristics such as 
age, land-use prior to flooding, climate, upstream catchment characteristics and management practices. Emissions 
vary spatially and over time.  
CO2 emissions 
Emissions of CO2 from Flooded Land remaining Flooded Land are primarily the result of decomposition of soil 
organic matter and other organic matter within the waterbody or entering the waterbody from the catchment, as 
well as respiration of biota (e.g. bacteria, macroinvertebrates, plants, fish, and other aquatic species). No guidance 
is provided in this section for emissions associated with decomposition of organic matter delivered from the 
catchment or respiration of biota because they are either accounted for elsewhere in the estimation methods 
(Volume 4, Chapter 4, Forest Land, CO2 emissions from soils Section 4.2.3, Chapter 5, Croplands, CO2 emission 
from soils, Section 5.2.3) or reflect short-term carbon cycling by the aquatic biota. The one exception is for Land 
Converted to Flooded Lands. CO2 emissions occur as the flooded organic matter decomposes, which is a 
consequence of anthropogenic management, and methods are provided for estimating the resulting CO2 emissions 
(Section 7.3.2.1).   
CH4 emissions 
Emissions of CH4 from Flooded Land are primarily the result of CH4 production induced by anoxic conditions in 
the sediment (see Annex 7.1). Methane can be emitted from small lakes or reservoirs via diffusive, ebullitive, and 
downstream emissions. Downstream CH4 emissions are subdivided into degassing emissions (see Glossary) and 
 
Chapter 7: Wetlands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
7.7 
diffusive emissions, which occur downstream from the flooded land. Methane emissions are generally higher in 
waterbodies with high organic matter loading and/or high internal biomass production, and low oxygen status.  
Due to their high emission rates and large numbers, small ponds of area < 0.1 ha have been estimated to generate 
40 percent of diffusive CH4 emissions from open waters globally (Holgerson & Raymond 2016). Whilst emissions 
from natural ponds can (at least in part) be considered natural, those from small constructed waterbodies are the 
result of anthropogenic activity. High organic loadings and low oxygen levels can also occur in drainage ditches 
(Evans et al. 2016), constructed ponds for agriculture (e.g. (Selvam et al. 2014) aquaculture (Avnimelech & Ritvo 
2003), and flooded pastures (Kroeger et al. 2017). Emission rates of CH4 from small constructed waterbodies 
where nutrient loadings from agriculture or other sources are high may exceed those from small natural 
waterbodies, (Tangen et al. 2015), (Yang et al. 2017), and may equal or exceed those observed in small lakes and 
reservoirs (Bastviken et al. 2011). Emissions of CH4 from aquaculture ponds may be reduced through aquaculture 
management, including mixing or aeration, periodic drainage or when water is saline (Vasanth et al. 2016), (Yang 
et al. 2017), (Robb et al. 2017). Because CH4 emissions from constructed waterbodies can be considered a direct 
consequence of the construction of the waterbody, guidance on reporting these emissions is provided in this chapter.  
Nitrous oxide emissions 
Nitrous oxide emissions from Flooded Lands are largely related to input of organic or inorganic nitrogen from the 
watershed. These inputs from runoff/leaching/deposition are largely driven by anthropogenic activities such as 
land-use change, wastewater disposal or fertilizer application in the watershed or application of fertilizer or feed 
in aquaculture. The current section does not consider these emissions in order to avoid double-counting of N2O 
emissions, which are already captured in other source categories, such as indirect N2O emissions from managed 
soils (see Volume 4, Chapter 11) and wastewater management (see Volume 5, Chapter 6). Nitrous oxide emissions 
from aquaculture ponds constructed on coastal wetlands are given in Chapter 4 of the 2013 Supplement Chapter 4, 
Section 4.3.2). Compilers may address local sources of N2O emissions (i.e. those not driven by external inputs of 
N) using Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods. 
TYPES OF FLOODED LANDS 
Reservoirs 
Reservoirs are designed to store water over time scales ranging from hours to several years. Their use can serve 
single (e.g. water supply) or multiple purposes, and reservoir operation may vary depending on different user needs 
(Table 7.7). Hydropower reservoirs can be divided in three categories: storage, run-of-the-river and pumped 
storage reservoirs. These categories generally describe the relationship between storage volume, inflow and water 
residence times, but in reality, reservoirs exist on a spectrum. Natural lakes may also be used as reservoirs, often 
by damming to expand their volume and surface area.  
Flooded land is exposed to natural or anthropogenic regulation of water levels, creating a drawdown zone. 
Greenhouse gas emissions from the drawdown zones are considered significant and similar per unit area to the 
emissions from the water surface (e.g. (Yang et al. 2012), (Deshmukh et al. 2018)) and are therefore included 
when estimating greenhouse gas emissions from Flooded Land. Lakes converted into reservoirs without substantial 
changes in water surface area or water residence times are not considered to be managed Flooded Land, in 
accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
Reservoirs are classified according to the length of time they have been flooded: 
(i) Flooded Land Remaining Flooded Land – includes reservoirs that were converted to Flooded Land more 
than 20 years ago.  
(ii) Land Converted to Flooded Land – includes reservoirs that were flooded less than or equal to 20 years ago. 
Other Flooded Land: Constructed ponds, canals, ditches and flooded pastures 
Ponds are constructed by excavation and/or construction of walls to hold water in the landscape for a range of uses, 
including agricultural water storage, access to water for livestock, recreation, and aquaculture. They often receive 
high organic matter and nutrient loadings, may have low oxygen levels, and are sites of substantial CH4 emissions 
from anaerobic sediments. However, because seawater suppresses production of CH4, emissions from saline 
aquaculture ponds are lower compared to freshwater ponds. Constructed linear waterbodies (which we define here 
in accordance with the Ramsar Convention category of ‘Human-made wetlands: Canals and drainage channels 
or ditches’) are also extensive in many agricultural, forest and settlement areas, and may also be significant sources 
of emissions in some circumstances. For CH4 emissions from Other Flooded Land, there are insufficient data to 
disaggregate based on age classes of the waterbodies.  
Flooded Land Excluded Here, But Considered Elsewhere  
Emissions from various kinds of Flooded Land that are not considered in this chapter are provided in the 2013 
Wetlands Supplement and in other parts of this guidance. Table 7.8 provides the Ramsar classification, which 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
7.8 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
provides the framework for the terminology used in this guidance. Some rice paddies are cultivated through 
flooding of land, but because of the unique characteristics of rice cultivation, rice paddies are addressed in Volume 
4, Chapter 5 (Cropland). Emissions from wetlands created or used for wastewater treatment are provided in 
Chapter 6 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement (Constructed Wetlands for Waste Water Treatment). Seasonally 
flooded agricultural land (including intensively managed or grazed wet meadow or pasture) that is formed via 
human modification of natural hydrological processes may also be considered Flooded Land, and can be a 
significant source of CH4 emissions (Kroeger et al. 2017). Seasonally flooded agricultural land may be coastal or 
inland, on mineral or organic soils, and relevant guidance for CO2 emissions and removals from these categories 
is provided in the 2013 Wetlands Supplement (Chapters 3-5, see Table 7.8 for details).  CO2 emissions associated 
with construction of aquaculture ponds in coastal wetlands are also considered in the 2013 Wetlands Supplement 
(Section 4.2.4 and Section 4.3.2). Flooding of land to create wetlands in coastal settings due to management 
activities, such as breaching of sea defences, are found under "rewetting" within the 2013 Wetlands Supplement 
(Section 4.2.3 for CO2 and 4.3.1 for CH4). Constructed seawater canals are not considered because there are 
insufficient data to derive an emission factor.  Furthermore, water in seawater canals is assumed to have salinity 
greater than 18 ppt, and therefore will have no CH4 emissions, consistent with guidance in the 2013 Wetlands 
Supplement.

CHOICE OF METHOD, ACTIVITY DATA AND EMISSION FACTORS  
Guidance is provided for choice of methods, activity data and emission factors for Flooded Land Remaining 
Flooded Land (Reservoirs > 20 years old) and other constructed waterbodies, and for Land Converted to Flooded 
Land (Reservoirs ≤ 20 years old). Guidance for selecting the type of waterbody based on human modification, 
hydrology (where there has been a significant change in surface area, and/or residence time, by > 10 percent), 
water quality, size and function and associated emission factors and activity data is presented in the decision tree 
in Figure 7.2. Tier selection and the level of spatial and temporal disaggregation will depend upon the availability 
of activity data and emission factors, as well as the importance of Flooded Land as an emission source based on 
the key category analysis for a country’s national greenhouse gas inventory. Figure 7.3 provides a decision tree to 
select the appropriate tier level for estimating emissions from Flooded Land. Country-specific emission factors 
and data are generally preferable to Tier 1 default data.  
Conversion of unmanaged waterbodies and unmanaged wetlands to managed Flooded Lands 
Greenhouse gas emissions (removals) occur on unmanaged land prior to conversion into managed land for both 
Flooded Land remaining Flooded Land and Land converted to Flooded Land. The anthropogenic impact on 
greenhouse gas emissions from managed flooded land reflect the net changes in greenhouse gas fluxes to the 
atmosphere resulting from the landscape transformation into a reservoir or other flooded lands (Prairie et al. 2017a). 
Indicative estimates of the anthropogenic component of the total greenhouse gas emissions occurring on the 
Flooded Land (see Annex Box A1) may optionally be estimated, in addition to the total emissions. This estimate 
may be obtained for Land Converted to Flooded Land by estimating emissions from the area of Managed Lands 
and Other Unmanaged Lands converted to managed Flooded Land. Types of Unmanaged Land converted to 
Flooded Land include: 1) unmanaged lakes and rivers (collectively termed ‘unmanaged waterbodies’) expanded 
by dam construction; 2) Unmanaged Wetlands (excluding lakes and rivers) converted to Flooded Land; and 3) 
Other Unmanaged Lands (including Unmanaged Forest Land, Grassland and Other Land). Previously flooded 
lands where changes in hydrology lead to substantial changes in the characteristics and ecological function of the 
area, or emissions and removals per unit area, may not be excluded from the calculation of indicative estimates of 
the anthropogenic component of total greenhouse gas emissions.  
Emissions from Unmanaged Wetlands converted to Flooded Lands are considered part of the non-anthropogenic 
component of the emissions for the first 20 years, after which they are considered to function similarly to the 
reservoir as a whole. This is the result of the legacy of the natural wetland function which will gradually transition 
to the condition of the surrounding reservoir as the accumulated organic matter is decomposed or buried in the 
reservoir. The method to produce indicative estimates of the anthropogenic component of total greenhouse gas 
emissions is presented separately in Section 7.3.3. 
The methods provided in this section are scientifically-based but with practical consideration for application of the 
methods by compilers.  It is good practice for the greenhouse gas emissions in the AFOLU sector to be estimated 
using the Managed Land Proxy (MLP), in which all emissions from managed land are considered anthropogenic, 
and to provide details of the methodology used (See Chapter 3, Volume 4). Therefore, for transparency, the 
methods are applied so that the total emissions from flooded lands are estimated based on the MLP, while 
emissions that are specifically to be the result of human activity within these areas are estimated by calculating the 
emissions for the area of Managed Land and Other Unmanaged Land converted to Flooded Land. For those 
countries that choose to develop indicative estimates of the anthropogenic component of total greenhouse 
emissions, it is good practice to report the MLP emissions, as well as the indicative estimates of the anthropogenic 
component of total greenhouse gas emissions. Details of the methodology used should be documented. As with 
other sources, Tier 1 methods have large uncertainties that may be reduced with development of Tier 2 or 3 
methods.

FLOODED LAND 
The initial flooding of land can cause elevated CO2 emissions as inundated soil and biomass decay. After this 
initial phase, typically lasting 20 years or less, the CO2 emitted from Flooded Land is largely derived from carbon 
input from the catchment, which is estimated as emissions from other managed land categories, and not addressed 
in this category to avoid double-counting of emissions (i.e., Volume 4, Chapter 4 Forest Land, Chapter 5 Cropland, 
Chapter 6 Grassland, Chapter 8 Settlements and the 2013 Wetlands Supplement). Therefore, no methodologies 
(Choice of Methods, Emission Factors, or Activity Data) are provided to estimate total CO2 emissions for Flooded 
Land Remaining Flooded Land.

Choice of Method 
The following methodology is provided for estimating CH4 emissions from reservoirs more than 20 years old. The 
Tier 1 methodology allows the estimation of the total diffusive, ebullitive and downstream CH4 emissions (see 
Glossary), FCH4tot, (Equation 7.10).  
If sufficient data exist, it is good practice for the compiler to develop country-specific emission factors using a 
Tier 2 or Tier 3 method to reduce overall uncertainty. Guidance on the development of country-specific factors 
and methods is provided below in the Tier 2 and 3 sections. For reservoirs less than 20 years old, see section 
7.3.2.3, Land Converted to Flooded Lands. 
Tier 1 
Total emissions from flooded land (FCH4tot) is the sum of the emissions occurring at the surface of the reservoir 
(FCH4res) and those originating within the reservoir but occurring downstream of the dam (FCH4downstream):

When chlorophyll values are not available, the trophic state adjustment factor (αi, Eq. 7.11) can be estimated from 
other general assessments of reservoir trophic status (See Table 7.11).  
Tier 2 
At the Tier 2 level, downstream emissions can be estimated based on water withdrawal depths for individual 
reservoirs.  If water is withdrawn from the oxic (upper) part of the water column, the CH4 content of the water is 
expected to be relatively low, therefore downstream emissions can be assumed to be zero.  If water is withdrawn 
from the anoxic (lower) part of the water column, where dissolved CH4 can accumulate to high levels, downstream 
emissions should be estimated following equation 7.10 using the Rd factor found in Table 7.10 or by a Tier 3 
methodology. 
If a country has characterized the trophic status of its reservoirs, a compiler can improve estimates of CH4 
emissions from these systems by multiplying default CH4 emission factors (from Table 7.9) by a factor, αi, either 
computed from measured mean annual chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data using Equation 7.11, or taken from Table 7.11 
where trophic state may be known but mean annual Chl-a data are lacking. Equation 7.10 generally provides a 
more accurate approach where reservoir Chl-a concentrations [Chl-a] have been measured. If sufficient data are 
available locally to determine a country-specific relationship between trophic status and CH4 fluxes, then local 
values should be used in Equation 7.10 rather than these global averages. 
Where there are sufficient data, compilers may also include the effect of carbon burial in the sediments in case 
there is a net removal of carbon in the managed flooded land (see Box 7.1).

BOX 7.1 (NEW) 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SEDIMENTATION AND CARBON BURIAL IN RESERVOIRS 
Reservoirs are often sites of significant accumulation of sediments, and therefore carbon (Clow et 
al. 2015). However, to consider such carbon accumulation as an offset to greenhouse gas emissions 
is complex because it depends strongly on the origin of the sediments and what the fate of the 
associated carbon would have been in the absence of a reservoir (Prairie et al. 2017a). For example, 
particulate organic carbon from the upstream catchment sediments would, prior to impoundment, 
have been transported and possibly stored further downstream. Only the net additional C storage 
induced by the sediment trapping within the reservoir would constitute removal. Similarly, if carbon 
burial is the result of autochthonous (inside the reservoir) primary production by algae or aquatic 
plants, such carbon removal would necessarily be reflected in the CO2 exchange occurring at the air-
water interface. Subtracting C sedimentation from the air-water exchange would thus lead to a 
double-counting of the same carbon flux. Lastly, in many reservoirs, maintenance operations involve 
the sluicing of excess sediments to the downstream river by opening gates located at the base of the 
dam, thereby releasing unknown, but often large, amounts of accumulated sediment carbon over a 
short period.  
As a result of the processes described above and the difficulties in quantifying them, a Tier 1 
methodology cannot be developed for the reporting of sediment carbon accumulation. For the 
development of higher Tier methodologies for carbon accumulation in reservoirs, an important 
guiding principle is that only the portion of the carbon permanently buried in reservoir sediments 
that would not have been stored elsewhere in the hydrological network (lakes, rivers, wetlands and 
the coastal ocean) could potentially be considered as an additional carbon burial in the anoxic 
sediment of the reservoir (Isidorova et al. 2019) . 
Tier 3 
Direct measurements of CH4 diffusion and ebullition fluxes across the reservoir surface provide the most accurate 
alternative to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches. It is good practice to undertake measurements at sufficient different 
locations and sufficient different times of year to capture both the spatial and temporal variability of CH4 emissions 
from a reservoir (see UNESCO/IHA GHG Measurement Guidelines for Freshwater Reservoirs 2010 (Goldenfum 
2010) for additional guidance). CH4 emissions are often highly spatially variable, with 50-90 percent of total 
reservoir emissions emanating from 10-30 percent of a reservoir’s surface (typically in areas subject to high 
organic matter deposition such as the distal arms receiving significant catchment inflows (Sherman et al. 2012)).  
Degassing can be estimated as the difference between the dissolved gas concentration at the water entering the 
dam and the dissolved gas concentration downstream of the dam, multiplied by the outlet discharge.  Dissolved 
gas concentration of the water entering the dam can be estimated from water samples collected from the reservoir 
at the depth of the water intake or directly from the water conveyance structure, if possible. Diffusive emission 
from the downstream river can be directly measured or estimated using a mass balance approach.  See (Goldenfum 
2010) (UNESCO/IHA), section 2.4.1.2.3). 
Accuracy is improved when measurements are undertaken across a full seasonal cycle because CH4 dynamics are 
very temperature sensitive. The accuracy of CH4 emissions can also be improved by considering atmospheric and 
hydrostatic pressure that may strongly influence CH4 ebullition. The measurement data should be area-weighted 
and seasonally averaged to provide the most accurate estimate of emissions from the reservoir as a whole (See 
Annex 7.1 for details).  
CH4 emissions from individual reservoirs can also be estimated by application of the Greenhouse Gas Reservoir 
Tool (G-res) model (Prairie et al. 2017b), with reservoir-specific data covering: reservoir morphometry, littoral areas, 
and local climate data including temperature and solar radiation. G-res is described in more detail in Annex 7.1.  
Other detailed models could be developed that include the range of environmental and management conditions 
that influence emissions (see Annex 7.1). 
Choice of Emission Factors 
Tier 1 
Emission factors for CH4 via diffusion and ebullition from the reservoir surface, EFCH4 age>20,j in the six aggregated 
climate zones are provided in Table 7.9. The emission factors integrate both spatial and temporal variations and 
have been derived from the application of empirical models to a large number of reservoirs (>6000) with a 
worldwide distribution and are averaged per climate zone. See Annex 7.1 for details of how default emissions 
factors were derived.

Tier 2 
Under Tier 2, country-specific emission factors may be developed that take into account national circumstances 
as well as specific properties of individual reservoirs including: reservoir operation, size, and depth; relative 
locations of oxic/anoxic water and water intakes; trophic status; sedimentation and sequestration of carbon; and 
other environmental (e.g. seasonal ice cover) and management factors. CH4 emissions due to wastewater inflow 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

may be estimated using the guidance in Volume 5, Chapter 6 and subtracted from reservoir emissions to avoid 
double counting (see Box 7.2). 
BOX 7.2 (NEW) 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON EMISSIONS ARISING FROM WASTEWATER WITHIN RESERVOIRS 
Emissions of CH4 from both Land Converted to Flooded Land and Flooded Land Remaining 
Flooded Land result from the degradation of autochthonous and allochthonous organic carbon in 
anoxic conditions (Bastviken et al. 2004). Allochthonous organic carbon from treated and/or 
untreated wastewater may reach the flooded land area and be converted to CH4 (Deemer et al., 2016). 
At Tier 2 and 3 it is a good practice to estimate CH4 emission from wastewater treatment and 
discharge using the guidance in Volume 5, Chapter 6 and subtract them from reservoir emissions, to 
avoid double counting. 
Tier 3 
Under Tier 3, emission factors derived from models (mechanistic or statistical) or measurement campaigns may 
be used instead of the default equations and/or default factors (see Annex 7.1). It is anticipated that a mix of 
country-specific emission factors and modelled values will be used when the latter do not cover the full range of 
environmental and management conditions within a country. The development of reservoir- or region-specific 
emission factors that are influenced by eutrophication is discussed below. CH4 emissions due to wastewater inflow 
may be estimated using guidance provided in Chapter 6, Volume 5 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and subtracted 
from the reservoir emissions to avoid double counting (see Box 7.2). The derivation of reservoir or region-specific 
factors should be clearly documented.  
Reservoirs or other constructed wetlands cause a perturbation of the natural processes of decay to the atmosphere 
of the organic matter contained in the water, so altering the natural pathway to GHG emissions of such organic 
matter when stored in such flooded land. The perturbation effect can be considered the anthropogenic component 
of the GHG emissions from the reservoirs. Approaches based on the mass balance of the organic carbon inputs 
and its decay also qualify as Tier 3 methods to estimate the emissions from reservoirs or other constructed 
waterbodies based on the Managed Land Proxy, caused by conveying freshwaters into reservoirs or other 
constructed wetlands. 
Choice of Activity Data 
Several different types of activity data may be needed to estimate Flooded Land emissions, depending on the Tier 
and the known sources of spatial and temporal variability within the national territory. 
Tier 1 
Country-specific data on the area of reservoirs within each climate zone are required to estimate CH4 emissions 
from flooded land. Estimates of flooded land area for reservoirs behind large dams can be obtained from the 
International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD 1988), from the World Commission on Dams report (WCD 
2000) , or from the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) database (Lehner et al. 2011b). However, country-specific 
datasets are likely to be more complete. 
Tier 2 and 3 
Estimates of flooded land area for reservoirs can be obtained from a drainage basin cover analysis or from a 
national dam database. Because flooded land area could change over time due to climate variation and change and 
management activities, countries should use updated and recent data from national databases in order to obtain 
more accurate emission estimates. Water withdrawal depths and anoxic zone depths are required for estimating 
downstream emissions at the Tier 2 level.  These data can be obtained from water utilities responsible for dam 
operation and maintenance as well as from national dam operation databases. Tier 3 approaches can also include 
more detailed activity data on, for example, effects of climate variability on water surface area and reservoir 
management, but the exact requirements will depend upon the model or measurement design. 
Data to directly calculate the trophic status adjustment, αi, (Eq 7.11, Table 7.11) can usually be sourced from water 
quality databases held by the relevant water authorities. Remote sensing of Chl-a concentrations may also be 
possible for larger reservoirs. 
OTHER CONSTRUCTED WATERBODIES (FRESHWATER PONDS, SALINE 
PONDS, CANALS AND DITCHES) 
The procedure presented here expands the methodology developed for quantifying CH4 emissions from drainage 
ditches in organic soils described in the 2013 Wetlands Supplement, to include all other constructed waterbodies 
apart from reservoirs, which are considered separately in the previous section. The approach described here allows 
 
Chapter 7: Wetlands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
7.17 
for the reporting of emissions from other Flooded Lands including constructed freshwater and saline ponds used 
for agriculture, aquaculture or other activities (e.g. recreation), and canals and ditches. This includes ponds within 
settlements; however, note that CH4 emissions associated with wastewater are considered elsewhere (Volume 5, 
Chapter 6, 2019 Refinement). For Managed Land categories on organic soils inventory compilers may choose to 
‘embed’ emissions from small channels such as drainage ditches within their reporting of other Managed Land 
categories (using Equation 2.4, Section 2.2.2.1 of Chapter 2, Drained Inland Organic Soils, of the 2013 Wetlands 
Supplement1). The same emissions should however not be included in Flooded Lands if they are included other 
Managed Land categories.  
Choice of Method 
Methodology is provided for estimating CH4 emissions from all other constructed waterbodies, including ditches 
and ponds.  If CH4 emissions from other constructed waterbodies are a key category, then it is good practice for 
the compiler to develop country-specific emission factors with application of a Tier 2 method or develop a country 
specific method with a Tier 3 approach to reduce overall uncertainty, incorporating variations in inundation 
regimes due to inter-annual and seasonal variation in water levels, management or other factors. All other 
constructed waterbodies are assumed to emit CH4 at a constant average rate for as long as the land remains flooded. 
However, waterbodies may move between emission categories as a function of changes in site factors if higher 
tier approaches are applied. Compilers could use different tiers for subcategories within the Other constructed 
waterbodies category, depending on the importance of different waterbodies and the availability of activity data. 
Guidance on the development of country-specific factors or methods is provided below in Tier 2 and Tier 3 
approaches.  
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method extends the methodology developed for quantifying CH4 emissions from drainage ditches in 
organic soils for the 2013 Wetlands Supplement (Section 2.2.2.1) to include a wider range of constructed 
waterbodies. At Tier 1, emission factors are not stratified by climate zone or trophic status, but this can be 
incorporated at Tier 2 and 3. See Annex 7.1 for details of how default emissions factors were derived.  
Total emissions are calculated for a given waterbody type using Equation 7.12.

ditches, incorporates country-specific information in Equation 7.19 to estimate the emissions. Tier 2 emission 
 
1  Note that the approach described to estimate ditch CH4 emissions in the 2013 Wetlands Supplement combined these emissions with those 
from adjacent terrestrial areas, to provide a single emission estimate. Implicitly, this approach considered ditches to form part of the terrestrial 
land-use category, rather than as a separate Flooded Land category. Either approach may be used, but not both. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
7.18 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
factors may be further stratified by sub-classifying waterbodies according to type (w) and trophic status (αj,w,i). In 
addition, it may be possible to incorporate additional modifiers such as soil type (e.g. mineral versus organic); 
water flow rate; inter-annual and seasonal variation in water levels; salinity; presence of emergent vegetation 
(which may increase emissions) and species (for aquaculture); or take account of site management activities that 
may increase or decrease overall CH4 emissions (e.g., controlling organic matter loadings or aeration, including 
pond drainage). 
Tier 3 
A Tier 3 approach for constructed ponds and ditches may specifically address the influence of different soils and 
land-uses within the catchment area of each waterbody as controls on organic matter and nutrient inputs. It could 
also disaggregate the different components of CH4 emissions (diffusive flux across the water surface, ebullition 
and plant-mediated emissions) and the associated controlling factors in order to provide more site-specific 
emission estimates. Compilers may also consider use of models that incorporate within-year and between-year 
variation in emissions as a function of climatic or land-management variability, water level variability or 
maintenance activities such as dredging and the duration of periodic drainage when sediments are exposed to air. 
Tier 3 approaches are likely to require the development of a process-based model to address these additional 
variables and activities influencing emissions as the small size and large number of waterbodies in some countries 
may make measurement-based approaches infeasible. For aquaculture ponds, Tier 3 approaches could also include 
models incorporating management practices (e.g. species, yield, aeration, drainage regimes). 
Choice of Emission Factors  
Tier 1 
Tier 1 emission factors for agriculture and aquaculture ponds, and from canals and ditches, are provided in Table 
7.12. Emissions from ponds are separated into Freshwater Ponds with water column salinity < 18 ppt and Saline 
Ponds with salinity of > 18 ppt, consistent with the 2013 Wetlands Supplement (Chapter 4, Annex 4A.1 salinity-
based definitions). At present, available data are not sufficient to derive emission factors for any category by 
climate zone, or to disaggregate emissions from canals, drainage channels and ditches, which are therefore 
considered as a single Tier 1 category. Disaggregation by surrounding land-use, nutrient loading and/or yield is 
also not currently possible at Tier 1. For ditches in organic soils, the Tier 1 emissions factors presented in Table 
2.4 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement may be used.

Tier 2 
At Tier 2, country-specific emission factors may be further stratified according to waterbody type, nutrient status, 
water levels or other potential explanatory factors (e.g. management practices or yield for aquaculture), as 
described in the preceding section. 
Tier 3 
To develop a model-based Tier 3 approach, additional empirical data are needed to define relationships between 
each component of the CH4 emission and the relevant explanatory variables. These components could include the 
effects of temperature, organic matter and nutrient supply and management processes such as periodic drainage; 
effects of salinity, water depth and flow on CH4 production in the sediment and oxidation within the water column; 
relationships between sediment composition and bubble production; and influence of vegetation type and cover 
on plant-mediated emissions.  
Choice of Activity Data 
Activity data consist of the total area of (non-reservoir) constructed waterbodies, stratified according to the 
waterbody type and any additional factors used to estimate emissions. Since flooded land area could change over 
time, countries should consider this in developing their time series of activity data, attributing land cover to the 
appropriate category. Countries may use older data sources to establish time series data as well as updated and 
recent data. Tier 2 and Tier 3 approaches are preferably based on national databases to track flooded land surface 
area in order to obtain more accurate emission estimates. For aquaculture ponds, additional data on product yields 
from ponds (FAO data) or management could be collected and related to CH4 emissions to derive more accurate 
emission estimates. 
Tier 1  
Activity data required to support Tier 1 reporting are either complete mapping data for all constructed waterbodies, 
or alternatively a reliable estimate of the proportion of land area occupied by each waterbody type, such as 
estimates derived from a land use survey. For agricultural ponds, it may be possible to evaluate small representative 
areas within a larger land category in order to estimate the total proportion (and therefore total area) of ponds 
present (Lowe et al. 2005). The Ramsar Convention (Ramsar 2005) provides guidance on mapping of wetlands 
(Annex III) which can be used to determine the area of Other constructed waterbodies. Additional guidance for 
mapping agricultural ponds can be found in (Shaikh et al. 2011) and MDBC (2009) (Cunningham et al. 2009). 
The minimum recommended scale of mapping is 1:5000 (50m x 50m or 0.25 ha), which could be used if 
appropriate data are available, for example from Landsat remotely sensed imagery (Pekel et al. 2016). Other 
satellite imagery has a higher resolution, for example Sentinel 2 data have a resolution of 10 m, sufficient to detect 
many smaller ponds, and are freely available.  In many cases, drainage occurs at regular spacing within agricultural 
landscapes, such that the proportion of ditches in an area can be estimated from data on mean ditch width and 
spacing, as described in Section 2.2.2.1 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement (the Fracditch calculation). For these areas, 
inventory compilers may choose to report these emissions within the appropriate land category, or separately in 
the Flooded Lands category. For irregularly distributed ditches or other constructed channels such as canals, it 
may be possible to estimate overall extent and area by digitizing or estimating total channel length within 
representative areas. For area of aquaculture ponds, estimates of area may be available from remote sensing 
imagery (Ottinger et al. 2017) or national databases.  If waterbodies vary substantially in their spatial extent 
through the year, the annual average (rather than annual maximum) inundated area may provide the most 
appropriate basis for flooded land area estimation. 
Tier 2  
Additional activity data required to apply a Tier 2 approach are likely to include information on waterbody 
distribution (e.g. from remotely sensed imagery), waterbody type, nutrient status, flow rates, vegetation and other 
factors as described in the Choice of Method section. Additional management-related factors may be considered if 
these affect emissions, for example if waterbodies are subject to large seasonal or short-term changes in water 
level and area, this may produce different CH4 emissions that a waterbody with the same average surface area but 
more constant water levels. For aquaculture ponds national databases of pond area or pond yields on an area basis, 
disaggregated by region or species cultivated could be used to increase accuracy of CH4 emission estimates.  
Tier 3  
Tier 3 approaches could include dynamic modelling of emissions evaluated from monitoring of greenhouse gas 
concentrations and fluxes in representative systems or measurements of emissions on fine spatial and temporal 
scales. Additional activity data required to apply a Tier 3 approach are likely to include information on waterbody 
distribution from remotely sensed imagery (which for drainage ditches could include high resolution aerial 
photography), waterbody type, nutrient status, flow rates, vegetation and other factors as described above. National 
level information capturing differing pond management (e.g. whether ponds are intensively managed or abandoned

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(Gusmawati et al. 2016), particularly where pond management influences CH4 emissions (e.g. through drainage, 
(Yang et al. 2015)) may also be appropriate to incorporate within a Tier 3 method. 
7.3.2 
Land Converted to Flooded Land 
7.3.2.1 TOTAL CO2 EMISSIONS FROM LAND CONVERTED TO 
FLOODED LAND 
RESERVOIRS 
Conversion of land to Flooded Land is a disturbance that affects all five terrestrial C pools in the area impounded 
(above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, litter, dead wood and soil organic matter; see 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines (Volume 4 Chapter 2, Fig. 2.1). The 2006 IPCC Guidelines and 2013 Wetlands Supplement, in addition 
to Chapter 2 of this volume, give guidance on how to estimate the five carbon pools in the land to be flooded and 
guidance is provided in Chapter 12 for estimating harvested wood products (HWP). This Chapter gives guidance 
on emissions related to land use conversion and the subsequent emissions. 
Carbon stock changes in the five pools that occur prior to Land Converted to Flooded Land need to be estimated 
using the guidance in other chapters (See Volume 4, Chapter 2; Equation 2.3).  The amount and fate of flooded 
biomass depends largely on management decisions prior to flooding. The area to be impounded may be totally or 
partially cleared of biomass including vegetation and the organic matter in soils prior to flooding. Another 
management procedure may be the burning of the biomass. If the pre-impoundment area was forested, and the 
forest was harvested before flooding, part of the biomass removed can go to HWP, but organic matter from 
grassland or cropland most likely remains. 
The time elapsed since flooding has a significant influence on greenhouse gas fluxes from Flooded Lands and also 
on the partitioning of the gases. Statistical analyses on reservoirs worldwide indicate that there is a rapid surge of 
emissions immediately following flooding, after which emissions return to a relatively stable level. The rate of the 
post-flooding decrease in emissions may depend on the region in which a reservoir is located and can differ 
between CO2 and CH4, but seems to occur mainly during the initial decade following flooding.  
Evidence suggests that CO2 emitted during approximately the first decade after flooding results from decay of 
some of the organic matter on the land prior to flooding. Upon flooding, the easily degradable carbon and nutrients 
are made available to the microbial community and metabolized. Beyond this time period, CO2 emissions are 
sustained by the input of organic material transferred into the flooded area from the watershed, (Houel 2003), 
(Hélie 2004), (Cole & Caraco 2001), and would have occurred in the absence of flooding, albeit displaced in space.  
In addition to managed lands, unmanaged lands such as natural forests and peatlands, existing (smaller) 
waterbodies and other land cover types not considered to be managed land may be converted to Flooded Land. 
This guidance describes methods for reporting emissions from each land use / land cover type converted to Flooded 
Land.  
Choice of Method  
Organic matter is subject to decay after flooding and the rate of decay diminishes over time following initial 
inundation. Therefore, it is not appropriate to report all C losses from biomass, dead wood, litter and soil organic 
matter in the first year after land is converted to Flooded Land. Because Land Converted to Flooded Land is 
defined as the first 20 years after flooding, the expected total CO2 emissions during the 100-year lifespan of the 
reservoir from the flooded stock of organic matter are allocated to these 20 years (see below and Annex 7.1 Fig 
A4). C stocks are estimated using existing methodologies when possible (e.g., Volume 4, Chapter 2).   
Organic C pools that remain in the impoundment area after flooding are subject to slow decomposition constrained 
by reduced presence of oxygen. The fate of organic matter removed from the area prior to flooding can vary. For 
example, biomass removed from the impoundment area prior to impoundment, e.g., by harvesting of timber, slash 
or stumps, is reported according to the guidance for CO2 emissions and removals (Volume 4, Chapter 2.3). The 
CO2 and non-CO2 emissions of deliberately burned biomass are reported according to guidance in other chapters 
(See Volume 4, Chapter 2). The biomass remaining in the impoundment area after flooding becomes submerged 
(except for that in the drawdown zone) and a fraction of this organic matter is subsequently decomposed to CO2 
(for more details, see Annex 7.1).  
Annex 7.1 explains how the G-res model estimates CO2 emissions for land converted to Flooded Land using 
average organic carbon stock in the top 30 cm soil layer as an empirically-based approximation for the total flooded 
organic matter decay (Annex 7.1, Section 1.5). Tier 1 emission factors are derived by determining the average,

spatially interpolated soil organic C stock for the flooded landscape area from a global soil carbon map (FAO, or 
default reference soil organic C stocks from Volume 4, Chapter 2. Table 2.3). 
Tier 1 
Emission factors for CO2 from the reservoir surface, EFCO2,j, in the six aggregated climate zones are provided in 
Table 7.13. The emission factors correspond to the total CO2 emission attributable to the reservoir and integrate 
both spatial and temporal variations and have been derived from the application of empirical models to a large 
(>6000) number of reservoirs with a worldwide distribution (see Annex 7.1 for details and (Prairie et al. 2017a)) 
and are averaged per climate zone.

 will be nearly 1 if only a river existed prior to inundation of a large reservoir. In contrast, 
the value will be close to 0 if the reservoir is a small expansion of a natural lake. 
Tier 2 may include: 1) a derivation of country-specific emission factors; 2) specification of climate sub-zones 
considered suitable for refinement of emission factors; 3) a finer, more detailed classification of management 
systems with a differentiation of pre-flooding land-uses; 4) differentiation of emission factors by time since 
flooding, and 5) a finer, more detailed classification of nutrient status or other water quality attributes, e.g. nitrogen, 
phosphorus, and chlorophyll. 
For compatibility of approach, country-specific Tier 2 factors for CO2 emissions and removals that are compiled 
using domestic flux data measured at the water-atmosphere boundary should follow a similar general concept to 
the G-res model, which is used in this guidance for generating Tier 1 emission factors (see details in Annex 7.1).  
An alternative method can use observed data on the decay curve of CO2 release to the atmosphere from the surface 
of the waterbody. These observations include a declining annual CO2 emission due to the newly flooded organic 
matter, and a natural annual background release of CO2 that is associated with catchment inputs and should not be 
included in the annual emissions. Instead, the natural emissions should be subtracted from the declining emissions 
in order to obtain the apparent CO2 release from the land converted to Flooded Land. The shape of the declining 
curve of annual CO2 release does not need to follow a specific equation, as long as it asymptotically declines as 
reservoirs age and can be integrated. 
It is good practice to derive country-specific emission factors if measurements representing the national 
circumstances are available. Countries need to document that methodologies and measurement techniques are 
consistent with the scientific background for Tier 1 emission factors in Annex 7.1. Moreover, it is good practice 
for countries to use a finer classification for climate and management systems. Note that any country-specific 
emission factor must be accompanied by sufficient national or regional land-use/management activity and 
environmental data to represent the appropriate climate sub-domains and management systems for the spatial 
domain for which the country-specific emission factor is applied. 
Tier 3 
CO2 emissions/removals at Tier 3, compared to those at Tier 2, would use detailed data and models of soil carbon 
and other remaining carbon pools prior to flooding and time series of CO2 emissions after flooding for a range of 
reservoirs that encompass an appropriate range of environmental conditions. Details for the development of 
measurement and model-based methods are discussed in Annex 7.1.

The emission factors are derived from model outputs for each climate zone (Annex A7.1.2.1). The aggregation into 6 climate zones is

Tier 2 and 3 
The Tier 2 approach for estimating total CO2 emissions from Flooded Land incorporates country-specific 
information with derivation of country-specific scaling factors.  The compiler may address other drivers of 
emissions including: 1) specification of climate sub-zones considered suitable for refinement of emission factors; 
2) a finer, more detailed classification of management systems including estimation of emissions associated with 
drawdown zones during the time period of low water level in reservoirs; 3) time-series data that incorporate 
seasonal/annual variation in CO2 emissions. Country-specific soil maps, measured in situ data, or updated versions 
of global soil databases that can be used in estimating the soil organic carbon stocks for 0-30 cm top soil layer 
within the flooded area using GIS tools. Table 7.14 provides scaling factor values that may be used with the Tier 
2 method.  
Choice of Activity Data 
Tier 1 
Areas of newly flooded lands are available from dam operators such as hydropower companies or responsible 
government agencies. In many cases recent impoundments have been extensively described in Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) documents of specific projects. Those documents are often publicly available. In absence 
of such information sources, satellite images and aerial images taken during the past 20 years are commonly 
available and allow determination of flooded land areas by comparison of pre-impoundment and post-
impoundment images.  
Tiers 2 and 3 
Detailed area information is needed for Tier 2 and 3 approaches, and can be found in geographic information 
products, reservoir statistics, or remote sensing products. Management systems for pre-impoundment land use 
characteristics of the flooded land may be derived from project-specific EIA documents, forest surveys from the 
pre-impoundment period, or remotely-sensed land cover assessments.  
Countries could consider differentiating the fluxes from the drawdown zone. Estimation of drawdown zone areas 
can be done using remote sensing images taken during the time period of low water level in reservoirs or from 
reservoir managers.   
Many countries also monitor water quality parameters from watercourses impacted by management activities. 
These include industrial effluent disposal, mining, land drainage, and wastewater treatment. In the best cases, time 
series of water quality parameters are available in national registers for over 20 years and may be useful for 
applying Tier 3 emission factors differentiated by those parameters.

OTHER CONSTRUCTED WATERBODIES (DITCHES, CANALS, FARM

emissions for coastal wetlands converted to aquaculture ponds by excavation based on guidance in the 2013 
Wetlands Supplement (Chapter 4, Coastal Wetlands).  For all types of pond created by damming, the methodology 
described above to estimate CO2 emissions from land converted to reservoirs may be used.  
7.3.2.2 TOTAL NON-CO2 EMISSIONS FROM LAND CONVERTED TO 
FLOODED LAND 
RESERVOIRS 
In reservoirs, high levels of CH4 emissions can occur in the first 20 years following flooding (see Annex 7.1). No 
guidance on estimating N2O emissions from flooded land is provided here because N2O emissions from aquatic 
systems are indirect N2O emissions from managed land that are addressed in other sections of this guidance (e.g. 
Volume 4, Chapter 11). 
Choice of Method  
Tier 1 
For Tier 1, guidance can be found in section 7.3.1 Non-CO2 emissions from Flooded Land Remaining Flooded 
Land. The Tier 1 approach to calculate CH4 emissions from Land Converted to Flooded Land (flooded ≤ 20 years 
prior to reporting year) is based on Equation 7.15, which differs from Equation 7.10 only in the values of the 
emission factors, EFCH4 age<20,j.

Approach to provide indicative estimates of the 
anthropogenic component of total CO2 and non-CO2 
emissions (optional) 
A method for estimating the contribution of human activities to total emissions from Flooded Land is provided 
that uses the area of Managed Land and Unmanaged non-Wetland categories converted to Flooded Land to develop 
indicative estimates of the anthropogenic component of total CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. This 
method includes the area that was not previously (before flooding) unmanaged lakes, rivers/streams and 
unmanaged wetlands, on the basis that emissions from these unmanaged lands are not reported in national 
greenhouse gas inventories. For unmanaged lakes and rivers, which have similar CH4 emissions to reservoirs, this 
method is robust. When unmanaged wetlands are flooded this method could under- or over-estimate anthropogenic 
CH4 and CO2 emissions because flooding may alter the greenhouse gas emissions and removals from these 
unmanaged lands due to changes in biogeochemical processes (see Annex 7.1.1). However, there are insufficient 
empirical data to provide guidance to estimate the changes in emissions from land that was unmanaged wetlands 
after it is flooded. Additionally, CH4 emission factors from unmanaged wetlands, reservoirs and other constructed 
waterbodies in many climate zones are broadly similar and thus when unmanaged wetlands are a small component 
of the land surface before the area was converted to Flooded Land this method is robust. If unmanaged wetlands 
occupy a high proportion of the surface of the land prior to flooding then countries may choose to better understand 
anthropogenic emissions at Tier 2 or 3 using methods described in section 7.3.1 and 7.3.2. However, previously 
flooded lands where changes in hydrology lead to substantial changes in the characteristics and ecological function 
of the area, or emissions and removals per unit area, may not be excluded from the calculation of indicative 
estimates of the anthropogenic component of total greenhouse gas emissions.

An analogous approach to develop indicative estimates of the anthropogenic component of total greenhouse gas 
emissions, following the same principles, could also be applied to other constructed waterbodies. Developing these 
estimates will require a Tier 2 or 3 method.

In general, other Unmanaged Lands, including forest land and grassland, are not considered a significant source 
of CH4 emissions, and removals of CH4 are not recognized as an anthropogenic source category in the AFOLU 
sector guidance. However some removal of CH4 can occur through oxidation of atmospheric CH4 by 
methanotrophic microorganisms in aerated soils, but this flux is typically small when expressed per unit land area 
(Oertel et al. 2016).  Regardless, no guidance is provided to estimate CH4 removal from unmanaged forest land 
and grassland.

7.3.4 
Uncertainty Assessment 
 
Chapter 7: Wetlands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
7.29 
The two largest sources of uncertainty in the estimation of CH4 emissions from Flooded Land are the quality of 
emission factors and estimates of the flooded land areas. 
Flooded Land surface area  
For reservoirs, national statistical information on the flooded area behind large dams (> 100 km2) should be 
available and will probably be accurate to within 10 percent. Where national databases on dams are not available, 
and other information is used, the Flooded Land areas retained behind dams will probably have an uncertainty of 
more than 50 percent, especially for countries with large Flooded Land areas. Detailed information on the location, 
type and function of smaller dams may be difficult to obtain, though statistical inference may be possible based 
on the size distribution of reservoirs for which data are available. Reservoirs are created for a variety of reasons, 
and this will influence the availability of data. Consequently, uncertainty regarding surface area is dependent on 
country specific conditions. 
Uncertainties in estimating emissions and removals from other constructed waterbodies (ditches, canals, farm 
ponds and aquaculture ponds) are to a large extent derived from assumptions and uncertainties in the area to which 
the EFs are applied. Variation in salinity of aquaculture ponds may also contribute to uncertainty in CH4 emissions. 
Emission factors 
As shown in Tables 7.9 and 7.15, average emissions can vary both within and among climate regions. Therefore, 
the use of any default emission factor will result in high uncertainty as reflected in the 95% confidence intervals 
as discussed in Annex 7.1. 
Downstream CH4 emissions occur primarily when anoxic and methane-rich hypolimnetic water (i.e. the lower 
water layer in a stratified water column) is withdrawn from a reservoir and passed through the dam structure, 
including turbines in hydropower reservoirs, and discharged to a downstream river (see Annex 7.1 for a more 
detailed description). Accordingly, downstream emissions are typically negligible in well-oxygenated reservoirs 
(Diem et al. 2012) or those with epilimnetic withdrawal (Beaulieu et al. 2014b), but can exceed emissions from 
the reservoir surface in thermally stratified systems with hypolimnetic withdrawal (Kemenes et al. 2007), (Abril 
et al. 2005). At the Tier 1 level, downstream emissions are estimated from Rd, defined as the average ratio of 
downstream to surface emissions.  Sources of uncertainty in Rd include differences among studies in how fluxes 
from the reservoir surface and downstream or the reservoir were measured. Uncertainty can be reduced at the Tier 
2 and 3 levels by accounting for the reservoir mixing patterns and withdrawal depths on a case-by-case basis. 
To reduce the uncertainties on emissions factors, countries should develop appropriate, statistically-valid sampling 
strategies that take into account natural variability of the ecosystem under study. When applicable, the distinction 
between ice-free and ice-covered periods may be a significant improvement in accuracy (Duchemin et al. 2006). 
Those sampling strategies should include enough sampling stations per reservoir, enough reservoirs and sampling 
periods. The number of sampling stations should be determined using a recognized statistical approach (see 
(Goldenfum 2010) (UNESCO/IHA for measurement guidelines). 
The EF values in Table 7.9 represent global averages and have large uncertainties due to variability in climate and 
management practices, including depth of the waterbody, salinity of water, presence of emergent vegetation, 
recharge rate and (for aquaculture) the intensity of management, including fish feeding characteristics and pond 
aeration. 
Uncertainties associated with the indicative estimates of anthropogenic component of total emissions  
The methods to produce the indicative estimates of the anthropogenic component of total emissions from managed 
flooded lands have additional uncertainties beyond the estimation of total emissions. The key uncertainty is 
determining the excluded areas that were unmanaged waterbodies (lakes and rivers) or unmanaged wetlands prior 
to flooding. The unmanaged river and possibly lake area is particularly challenging to estimate if there is large 
intra- or inter-annual variability in river water level, resulting in a highly variable river area over time. To address 
this uncertainty, compilers may use the long-term mean river and lake area, but it should be highlighted that there 
is a risk for higher uncertainty where the average area is challenging to assess.

Estimation of Default Emission Factor(s) for 
greenhouse gas emissions from Flooded Lands 
7A.1.1 Background on CH4 cycling in Flooded Land 
CH4 emissions from aquatic environments are the combined result of CH4 production, oxidation and transport 
processes, which are described in e.g. (Bastviken 2009), (Bridgham et al. 2013), (Duc et al. 2010), and (Bogard 
et al. 2014) (the two former being reviews and the two latter describing updates). A summary is provided below: 
Production and oxidation of CH4 
Methane production is a microbially-mediated process that primarily occurs in anoxic sediment. Sediment 
methanogenesis represents the terminal step in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter, and is strongly 
stimulated by temperature, anoxic conditions, and high sedimentation rates.  The last of these, sedimentation, 
provides organic matter and promotes anoxia. Inhibition is induced by the presence of molecular oxygen (O2) and 
other alternative electron acceptors in organic matter degradation, such as nitrate, iron (III), manganese (IV) and 
sulphate. Because sulphate is common in waters with high salinity, methanogenesis in the upper sediments is often 
low under saline conditions (Reeburgh 2007).  
Methane oxidation in aquatic environments is primarily a microbial process in which dissolved CH4 is used as a 
carbon and energy source. Therefore, CH4 oxidation takes place at redox gradients where both CH4 and suitable 
electron accepting compounds are present. Anaerobic CH4 oxidation using e.g. nitrate and sulphate has been 
observed and sulphate-dependent CH4 oxidation can be important in saline sediments. In freshwater environments, 
O2 dependent CH4 oxidation is considered to dominate (Bogard et al. 2014). By being confined to redox gradients, 
CH4 oxidation is therefore often most intense in spatially restricted zones near the interface between anoxic and 
oxic conditions in water columns, or in the top millimetres of sediments overlain with oxic water (below a few 
mm depth most sediments are anoxic). The oxidation of CH4 can be extensive and reported removal of dissolved 
CH4 during passage through a zone with oxidation often range from 50 to >95% (Bastviken 2009). Aerobic CH4 
oxidation in situ is considered to be primarily substrate dependent, i.e. to depend largely on concentrations and 
supply rates of CH4 and O2.  
The transport of CH4 through waterbodies  
With reference to processes numbered in Figure 7A1, the transport of CH4 through a reservoir can be described 
as follows (Bastviken 2009):  
CH4 produced in anoxic sediments, and subsequently dissolved in the water, is transported along the concentration 
gradient by Fickian transport (molecular diffusion or eddy diffusion) and, at times advection, into the hypolimnion 
water (1). The transport of CH4 from the hypolimnion into the epilimnion is often very small due to limited mixing 
between water layers and because extensive microbial CH4 oxidation occurs at the interface where both CH4 and 
O2 are present (Bastviken et al. 2008) (2). The release of CH4 from epilimnetic sediments is also constrained by 
CH4 oxidation, similarly occurring at the oxycline in the top several mm of the sediment (3). However, water 
movements such as waves can speed up CH4 transport across the epilimnetic sediment-water interface (Bussmann 
2005), reducing the fraction being oxidized. Additional epilimnetic CH4 can be sustained by production in oxic 
water (Bogard et al. 2014) (4). The dissolved CH4 in surface water is emitted across the diffusive boundary layer 
at the water-atmosphere interface (diffusive emission). The diffusive emission rates are stimulated by high CH4 
concentrations and high turbulence in the water (5). The solubility of CH4 in water is rather low, and therefore 
CH4 bubbles are formed in the sediment. Emissions to the atmosphere by ebullition occur when such CH4-rich 
bubbles are released and rapidly rise through the water column into the atmosphere (6). Ebullition can be the 
dominant flux pathway, and is influenced by CH4 production rates in the sediment, physical triggers releasing 
bubbles such as drops in barometric pressure, changes in the water level or waves. CH4 emissions can also occur 
via rooted emergent aquatic plants with gas transporting aerenchyma tissue.  These structures can function as gas 
conduits between sediments and the atmosphere. Such plant-mediated emission can be substantial and depends on 
CH4 production, plant abundance, activity and species composition. In reservoirs, water, with its dissolved CH4, 
is withdrawn into the dam structure (D) inlet and released to the outlet river (7a and 7b). The dissolved CH4 can 
then be degassed to the atmosphere upon passage through dam structures or emitted after release to the outlet river 
(8). Both degassing and reservoir-related emissions from the outlet river are a result of the reservoir, but occur 
downstream of the reservoir surface and are collectively referred to in this chapter as downstream emissions. 
Downstream emissions are low if oxic epilimnetic water with low CH4 concentrations is withdrawn (7a), but can 
be high if anoxic, CH4 rich hypolimnetic water is withdrawn (7b).  
The degassing of the water in the turbines is relevant in hydroelectric reservoirs only, but the other parts of the 
description in Figure A1 are valid for non-hydroelectric reservoirs and for non-reservoir waterbodies.

Emissions of CH4 
Aquatic CH4 emissions are favoured by high CH4 production and by conditions facilitating transport pathways 
where most CH4 escapes oxidation. Conditions leading to high whole-system CH4 production rates include low 
salinity  (Camacho et al. 2017), high temperatures (Yvon-Durocher et al. 2014), (Deemer et al. 2016), (DelSontro 
et al. 2016), and a high load of labile organic matter (DelSontro et al. 2016), (DelSontro et al. 2018), (Deemer et 
al. 2016). The overall CH4 production potential in freshwaters in a given climate zone is also positively related to 
the flooded area. In this guidance: estimation of emissions from coastal aquaculture ponds (Tier 1) is improved by 
consideration of salinity of the water as sulphides in seawater supress methanogenesis (Poffenbarger et al. 2011); 
temperature is considered by separating emission factors by climate zone and including temperature seasonality 
when generating emission factors (Tier 1); methanogenic habitat extent is considered by including the area of the 
flooded land in calculations (Tier 1); and the supply of labile organic matter is considered via a trophic state 
adjustment option (Tier 2; see also below). 
Conditions favouring rapid transport from sediments to the atmosphere by ebullition or via plants, bypassing CH4 
oxidation zones, include shallow water depth and a high abundance of emergent aquatic plants. These conditions 
are indirectly considered at the whole climate zone level at the Tier 1 via validation to available data, but are highly 
variable among waterbodies and consideration for individual waterbodies can therefore only be performed at the 
Tier 3 level. Downstream emissions also represent situations where high water turbulence causes rapid emission 
of CH4 with little time for oxidation. Downstream emissions are considered at Tier 1, and are estimated using 
empirical relationships between CH4 fluxes from waterbody surfaces and observed downstream emissions. 
Trophic status and greenhouse gas emissions from Flooded Lands 
Flooded lands with high inputs of nutrients and high rates of biological production (eutrophic systems) generally 
emit CH4 to the atmosphere more rapidly on a per-area basis than less productive (meso- or oligotrophic) systems. 
This relationship is seen in meta-analyses examining fluxes from many reservoirs (Narvenkar et al. 2013), (Deemer 
et al. 2016), and a positive relationship between local primary production and CH4 emission has also been 
demonstrated in laboratory assays using sediments from individual lakes (West et al. 2016). One recent review of 
available data found that, on average globally, per-area CH4 fluxes are 8.0 times higher for eutrophic reservoirs 
than for mesotrophic reservoirs, which in turn have CH4 fluxes that are, on average, 1.7 times as high as those 
from oligotrophic systems (Deemer et al. 2016). Therefore, when possible, we recommend that countries include 
an estimate of trophic status in their estimates of reservoir CH4 emissions allowing adjustment of emission factors 
at Tier 2. Trophic status designation is generally achieved using either total phosphorus or chlorophyll a data and 
latitude-specific classification cut-offs (Carlson 1977).   
It has been suggested that eutrophication can enhance CO2 uptake and burial (Pacheco et al. 2015), but there is no 
evidence that this occurs consistently, and, when it does occur, the magnitude of this effect on CO2 is generally 
much smaller (in overall greenhouse gas flux terms) than the effect of eutrophication on CH4 emissions (Deemer 
et al. 2016). 
Estimating the indicative anthropogenic component of total emissions  
Estimation of the indicative anthropogenic component of total emissions or removals reflects the changes in 
greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere resulting from the landscape transformation into a reservoir or other 
flooded lands. Unmanaged wetlands (e.g. peatlands) emit CH4 and sequester soil carbon and unmanaged lakes can 
also be a source of CH4 prior to their conversion to a reservoir, but these are not estimated in national greenhouse

gas inventories. The calculations allow for estimation of the anthropogenic component of emissions when these 
unmanaged lands are converted to a reservoir by only considering the flooded land that was not previously 
unmanaged lakes or wetlands. Box 7A.1 describes the general approach for estimating anthropogenic emissions, 
based on the area of Managed Land and unmanaged non-Wetland categories, which is used in this Guidance. 
BOX 7A.1 (NEW) 
APPROACH FOR DEVELOPING INDICATIVE ESTIMATES OF THE ANTHROPOGENIC COMPONENT OF TOTAL 
EMISSIONS FROM FLOODED LAND 
The diagram below shows the rationale for indicative estimation of the anthropogenic component of 
total emissions using the example of CH4 and CO2 fluxes from a reservoir where land is either 
unmanaged (left) or managed (right) prior to flooding. CH4 and CO2 fluxes after flooding are shown 
(green arrows) compared to before flooding and the anthropogenic component, the newly flooded 
land (red arrows) for Flooded Land remaining Flooded Land (FLRFL) and Land converted to 
Flooded Land (LCFL). CH4 emissions/removals from the original water surface area and from 
unmanaged wetlands are not considered in this approach by subtracting their area from the total 
surface area of the reservoir.  
For estimating anthropogenic CO2 emissions/removals from the reservoir, CO2 fluxes from 
unmanaged lands in both FLRFL and LCFL are assumed zero. Changes in soil carbon stocks during 
the first 20 years after flooding (LCFL) are provided in the guidance. For both FLRFL and LCFL, 
long-term CO2 fluxes arising from the decomposition of catchment-derived organic matter are 
considered natural in this guidance and are not incorporated into the CO2 emission factors. For 
managed land (e.g. forest, croplands or grasslands), CO2 and CH4 fluxes prior to flooding, guidance 
is provided in other Chapters and not considered here.  
 
7A.1.2 Reservoirs 
Introduction 
Correctly estimating the anthropogenic component of greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs requires a careful 
assessment of the source and fate of reservoir carbon fluxes as such estimates are prone to double counting and 
inappropriate attribution of fluxes to human activity (Prairie et al. 2017a). The greenhouse gas emission factors 
from Flooded Lands presented in this methodology report are composited output from an empirical model (Prairie 
et al. 2017b), developed and calibrated with field measurements from diverse types of reservoirs located in various 
regions of the world (see section 7A.1.2.3 Data Sources). The model allows us to annualize emissions that are 
often measured over short periods (e.g. during the ice-free period for boreal systems) and estimate changes in 
reservoir greenhouse gas activity that have been observed to occur as reservoirs age. We anticipate that the models 
will continue to improve over time as more measurements are made and additional models become available.

7A.1.2.1 DEVELOPING TIER 1 EMISSION FACTORS FOR CO2 AND NON-
CO2 EMISSIONS FROM FIELD MEASUREMENTS  
Recent, largely overlapping, literature compilations of field greenhouse gas measurements from over 220 distinct 
reservoirs (Deemer et al. 2016), (Prairie et al. 2017b) form the basis of the emissions factors listed in Tables 7.9 
and 7.15. The field measurements are a mixture of diffusive CO2, CH4 diffusive and/or bubble emissions and, for 
a new but smaller subset, downstream emissions for either or both gases. The method used to estimate greenhouse 
gas fluxes from reservoirs is critical because different techniques can give quite different flux estimates (Schubert 
et al. 2012), (Deemer et al. 2016), and because techniques integrate spatial and temporal variability to different 
degrees (Wik et al. 2016). Flux estimates used to derive reservoir EFs in Chapter 7 were attained in a variety of 
ways. For CO2, diffusive fluxes were estimated using near-surface concentrations in combination with a thin 
boundary layer model for the majority of systems (Deemer et al. 2016), floating chambers, or, in a minority of 
cases, eddy flux measurements.  For CH4, diffusive fluxes were estimated using near-surface concentrations in 
combination with a thin boundary layer model or chamber flux measurements.  Ebullition fluxes of CH4 were 
estimated using inverted funnel traps and echo sounders. Combined ebullitive and diffusive CH4 fluxes were 
estimated using floating chambers or eddy flux techniques, or a combination of available methods.  Downstream 
emissions for gases were available for only a subset of the studied reservoirs. 
Deriving Emission Factors directly from the compiled data is subject to a number of assumptions that can lead to 
potential biases. First, it requires an assumption that sampled systems are statistically representative of overall 
reservoir distribution, a potentially problematic assumption given that measurement campaigns may occur in 
systems and periods in time where or when greenhouse gas emissions are high (e.g. where CH4 bubbling is visible) 
or low. Second, it assumes that sampling of reservoirs is representative in time, potentially leading to biases as 
there is considerable evidence that greenhouse gas emissions decrease markedly as reservoirs age (Abril et al. 
2005), (Barros et al. 2011), (Teodoru et al. 2012), (Serça et al. 2016).  
The Emissions Factors from reservoirs presented for this methodology were derived from the application of the 
Greenhouse Gas Reservoir (G-res) model (Prairie et al. 2017b). The G-res model is currently the only easily and 
widely applicable model and was developed to account for the potential biases described above. It uses empirical 
relationships between environmental drivers and emissions to estimate reservoir greenhouse gas fluxes. Depending 
on available input data, the G-res model can also be used to make Tier 2 or Tier 3 estimates.  
The methodology used to develop the G-res model and its usage to estimate reservoir greenhouse gas emissions is 
described in detail in (Prairie et al. 2017b) but, briefly, consists of the following steps: 
1. Data annualization: field sampling campaigns reported in the literature are rarely carried through the entire 
annual cycle. For this reason, greenhouse gas data obtained over sub-annual time periods were annualized by 
taking into account the annual temperature cycle at the reservoir site and the known temperature dependence 
of processes leading to the production of CO2 and CH4. 
2. Identifying relationships between annualized flux estimates and environmental variables: environmental 
characteristics for each reservoir where greenhouse gas fluxes have been measured were extracted using 
available global databases (GIS layers) and used as input variables for predictive models with an elastic net 
variable selection procedure. This statistical analysis of the relevant data yielded the following model equations:

and explained between 37 and 47% of the variation in the greenhouse gas flux component (log scale).  
1. Application of the models to larger database: 
The empirical models described above were applied to the larger Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) database, 
(Lehner et al. 2011a) consisting of 6684 reservoirs with capacity >0.1 Mm3 located worldwide as shown in the 
map in Figure 7A.2. These reservoirs are estimated to comprise collectively over 75% of the global surface area 
of reservoirs and are distributed in all climate zones (Table 7A.1, Figure 7A.2). The environmental variables 
required by the models were extracted for each reservoir as previously described and were used as inputs in 
Equations 7A.1 to 7A.3 to estimate the various components of greenhouse gas emissions. In total, greenhouse gas 
emissions could be estimated for more than 6000 reservoirs worldwide.

2. Derivation of CH4 Emissions Factors:  
CH4 emission is the sum of reservoir-wide ebullitive and diffusive emissions (Equations 7A.1 and 7A.2). However, 
because the diffusive component is not constant in time but declines with age, Equation A.1 was integrated to 
estimate the average annual emission over different periods. Based on the available literature, much of the initial 
greenhouse gas pulse occurs within the first 20 years following impoundment and this time interval was assumed 
to represent Land converted to Flooded Land. The emission factor of CH4 in this time interval can be derived with 
Equation 7A.4. For Flooded Land remaining Flooded Land, the integration period was from 20 to 100 years post-
impoundment. The emission factor of CH4 in this time interval can be derived with Equation 7A.5.

Application of Equations 7A.4 and 7A.5 to the reservoirs described in Table 7A.1 were averaged according the 
aggregated climate zones defined in Table 7A.2 to produce the final Emission Factor (EF) tables for Flooded Land 
Remaining Flooded Land (Table 7.9) and Land Converted to Flooded Land (Table 7.15). Emissions factors (EFs) 
are expressed as kg CH4 ha-1 yr-1. 
In addition to the diffusive and ebullitive emissions from reservoir surfaces, downstream CH4 emissions are 
estimated. These downstream emissions are estimated by multiplying reservoir emissions by a fraction (Rd), which 
is the ratio of total CH4 emissions (kg CH4-C y-1) downstream of the reservoir (i.e. degassing at the dam and 
emissions from the downstream river) to CH4 emissions from the surface of the reservoir (diffusion + ebullition; 
kg CH4-C y-1).  Downstream emissions are influenced by local climate, reservoir morphology, and design features 
of the dam and spillway (Deemer et al. 2016).  In general, these emissions will be large in thermally stratified 
reservoirs with anoxic, CH4-rich bottom waters and hypolimnetic withdrawal (dos Santos et al. 2017). These 
emissions can be further enhanced by high air-water gas exchange rates at the dam or spillway that promote the 
rapid evasion of CH4 to the atmosphere before it can be oxidized to CO2 in the downstream river (Abril et al. 2005). 
Accurately predicting downstream emissions requires detailed knowledge of dam design (i.e. withdrawal depth) 
and operating conditions (i.e. withdrawal rates) and is beyond the scope of the Tier 1 methodology. However, if 
appropriate at a higher tier, downstream emissions may be estimated using climate zone specific Rd values in Table 
7.10 derived from a literature compilation listed in section 7A.1.2.3 Data Sources. 
Downstream emissions have received much less attention than emissions from reservoir surfaces, but have been 
reported for 36 reservoirs distributed across the 6 aggregated IPCC climate zones (see section 7A.1.2.3 Data 
Sources, Table 7A.5). It should be noted, however, that reported downstream emissions can be biased high or low, 
depending on study-specific methodological details. For example, several studies assumed that all excess dissolved 
CH4 (i.e. the difference between actual dissolved CH4 concentration and atmospheric equilibrium) entering the 
dam would evade to the atmosphere via a combination of degassing at the dam and diffusion from the river surface 
(Beaulieu et al. 2014a), (Teodoru et al. 2012). This approach will overestimate downstream emissions because up 
to 85% the CH4 that enters the downstream waterbodies can be oxidized to CO2 (Kemenes et al. 2007). Other 
studies only reported degassing in turbines (i.e. did not estimate downstream waterbody emissions), thereby 
biasing downstream emissions low (Maeck et al. 2013). Although methodological differences can bias 
downstream emission values, the effect of methodology was not apparent in the pooled data, likely because other 
factors, such as the depth of water withdrawal relative to the oxycline, were more important drivers. Similarly, 
differences among climate zones were not apparent in the data, therefore the Tier 1 Rd value was not disaggregated 
by climate zone. Due to the highly skewed distribution of reported Rd values, the Tier 1 Rd value is based on the 
median value (see 7A.1.2 “Validation of the data-model approach”). At the Tier 2 level the downstream emission 
term in Equation 7.10 can be set to zero in reservoirs where epilimnetic water is withdrawn and discharged to the 
river downstream. Countries can directly measure downstream emissions at the Tier 3 level using the methods 
discussed in the references cited in section A7.1.2.3 Data Sources (Table A5).

3. Grouping of reservoirs according to IPCC climate zones 
The 6014 estimates of CH4 emissions (diffusive + ebullitive) from worldwide reservoirs generated by the G-res 
tool were grouped according to the IPCC climate regions. A regression tree approach was used to lump certain 
climate categories together based on their abilities to separate groups with different CH4 emissions. The final 
grouping comprised 6 aggregated climate zones (Table 7A.2) and these were applied throughout this Methodology 
Report.

Surface Emissions 
Model estimations and direct measurements are not strictly comparable in that the former have been annualized 
and represent the integrated average annual emissions of the first 20 years post-impoundment (plus ebullitive 
emissions) while the latter are point measurements encompassing varying degrees of spatial and temporal 
integration depending on the study. Nevertheless, it is informative to compare the central tendency and variability 
in CH4 emissions among reservoirs in each of the climate zones. Both model estimations and field measurements 
were highly variable and positively skewed in each climate zone (Figure 7A.3).

Figure 7A.3 (New)  
Box plots of model estimates (empty) and Field measurements (filled) 
of CH4 emissions (note logarithmic scale) in aggregated IPCC climate 
zones. 
 
Field measurements are from (Deemer et al. 2016) while modelled estimates are derived from G-res model applied 
to about 6000 reservoirs worldwide. Exact correspondence between measured and modelled ranges is not expected 
given that the models were applied to a large number of reservoirs of different configurations. Numbers in box 
plots correspond to the number of observations in each climate zone. 
While the distribution of modelled and measured greenhouse gas emission estimates generally overlapped in each 
climate zone, a more direct measure of correspondence is shown by the relationship between field measurements 
versus model estimates of CH4 emissions (Figure 7A.4). CH4 emissions from individual reservoirs predicted using 
the Tier 1 approach agreed reasonably well with measured CH4 emissions (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency: 0.8, with no 
detectable bias in either slope or intercept of least-squares regression; Figure 7A.4). These comparisons 
collectively provide evidence that the model estimates capture both the variability and central tendency in CH4 
emission rates.

Downstream Emissions 
Downstream emissions estimated using the median of the literature Rd values (0.09), combined with model 
estimated surface emission rates, agree well with observed downstream emission rates (Figure 7A.5). Downstream 
emissions estimated using the mean Rd literature value (0.60) systematically overestimate downstream emissions 
(Figure 7A.5), lending additional support for the use of the median Rd value for estimating downstream emissions.

7A.1.2.2 CO2 EMISSION FACTORS FOR LAND CONVERTED TO 
FLOODED LAND. 
The creation of reservoirs as well as other Flooded Lands often involves the flooding of terrestrial ecosystems and 
their organic matter pools. A portion of these pools is rapidly degraded by microbial activity generating a CO2 
pulse that diminishes steadily during the 10-20 years following flooding until the Flooded Land attains a new 
steady state emission rate (Abril et al. 2005), (Barros et al. 2011), (Teodoru et al. 2012). The new steady state 
emission rate generally falls in the range typical of other freshwater ecosystems that have remained flooded for > 
20 years (Prairie et al. 2017b). Meta-analyses of published emission studies (Barros et al. 2011), (Prairie et al. 
2017b) suggest that the rate of decline decreases with time (faster in the early years, slower later on) and that the 
temporal evolution of CO2 emissions is expressed as a general negative power function. The literature suggests 
that a decade is a realistic period for the return to a quasi-equilibrium (e.g.(Tremblay et al. 2005), reflecting the 
new balance between primary production and respiration of the reservoir ecosystem. A more conservative 
approach assumes, instead, that this new equilibrium is reached only after 100 years - a value that is often used to 
represent the expected lifetime of reservoirs in life-cycle analysis (e.g. (Gagnon et al. 2002). Over such a period, 
integration of the emissions above the modelled new equilibrium value at 100 years (upper panel of Figure A6) 
suggests that about 75% of the cumulative CO2 flux is natural, i.e. that only 25% can be considered the result of 
the impoundment process (Prairie et al. 2017a). 
The carbon stocks of the land prior to impoundment are specific for each land use / land cover, and the default 
Tier 1 estimates for these pools can be derived from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, FAO 2017 database as refined in 
this volume, and the 2013 Wetlands Supplement, while masses for dry matter in undrained and drained peatlands 
are given in the 2013 Wetlands Supplement Table 2.6. The guidelines recognize five terrestrial C pools: above-
ground biomass, below-ground biomass, dead wood, litter and soil organic matter. In preparation of the 
impoundment area, the carbon losses from harvested biomass and the emissions from deliberately burned biomass 
are reported according to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines as refined in this volume. The CO2 emissions from the decay 
of dead organic matter in the newly flooded land is described below. 
The easily decomposable organic matter fractions (litter, foliage, twigs, fine roots, organic soils) contribute to the 
post-flooding CO2 pulse, while the more recalcitrant fractions (tree boles, mineral soils) are for the most part 
preserved. However, it is noteworthy that following flooding, the mineral soil layer rapidly becomes (and remains 
indefinitely) anoxic below a depth of a few mm (Lorke et al. 2003). Anaerobic remineralisation occurs very slowly 
and below this depth, organic carbon can be considered permanently buried for practical inventory estimation 
purposes. In organic soils and in humus layers, flooding may produce an analogous anaerobic zone. In thermally 
stratified reservoirs, mineralisation of organic matter will be retarded in anoxic hypolimnia. 
 
Chapter 7: Wetlands 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
7.41 
The surge in CO2 emission post-flooding is caused by the remineralisation of pre-flooding organic matter pools 
and it can be considered as a net loss of the carbon stock from the previous land use. At the moment, there is little 
information to quantify how individual terrestrial organic carbon pools contribute to the post-flooding CO2 surge.  
Nevertheless, the abundant amount of reservoir emission measurements for young (< 20 y) reservoirs (Deemer et 
al. 2016) has made possible the development of models such as G-res that can be used to estimate net post-flooding 
CO2-C emissions (Table 7.13). 
The approach used to derive net CO2 emissions from reservoirs is the same as that used to derive emissions of CH4 
(section 7A.1.2.1) and is based on the greenhouse gas reservoir (G-res) model (Prairie et al. 2017b) which uses 
empirical relationships between environmental drivers and greenhouse gas emissions to estimate reservoir 
greenhouse gas fluxes from a large, diverse set of reservoirs (>6000 reservoirs with global distribution). 
Instantaneous greenhouse gas flux measurement data are annualized to take into consideration seasonal changes 
in temperature that may be different from the moment when empirical measurements were conducted in the field. 
An example where annual fluxes are generated from point measurements is described in the technical 
documentation of the IHA G-Res tool (Prairie et al. 2017b). There are two approaches to derive emissions. In one, 
a power function for annual flux, CO2 = C ∙ Age-b where C is a reservoir specific constant depending on nutrients, 
temperature, reservoir area etc. and b is estimated by fitting to the data, is assumed to reach the natural equilibrium 
level of CO2 flux at the reservoir age of 100 years. That level determines how much of the annual CO2 flux should 
be subtracted each year from the integrated area under the flux CO2 curve, see (Prairie et al. 2017a). Another 
approach, which is applied to derive Tier 1 emission factors, uses an empirical relationship between the derived 
integrated decay curve and soil organic carbon stock as well as climate under the newly flooded area (Fig. 7A.6 
and Equation 7A.3). The emissions attributable to the creation of the reservoir over a 100-year period are reported 
as a constant rate over the first 20 years post-flooding. Accordingly, the rates of emissions are dependent on climate 
and soil C content (to 30 cm depth) for the flooded area (see text in 7A.1.2 and Equation 7A.3 and section 7.3.2, 
Equation 7.14).

Data sources and range of emission values (mg C-CH4 m-2 d-1) for directly measured CH4 emissions are in Table 
7A.3. Data sources used to develop models (Equations 7A.1, 7A.2 and 7A.3) are largely overlapping and are in 
Annex VI of Prairie et al. 2017b. These were used in section 7A.1.2.2 of this Annex to validate the Emission 
Factors provided in Tables 7.9 and 7.15.   
Data sources (including systems assessed and citations) for estimating the multiplier (RD, Table 7.10) which is the 
ratio of total CH4 emissions (kg CH4-C yr-1) downstream of the reservoir (i.e. degassing at the dam and emissions 
from the downstream river) to CH4 emissions from the surface of the reservoir (diffusion + ebullition; kg CH4-C 
yr-1)  are in Table 7A.4.

7A.1.3 Other constructed waterbodies (agricultural ponds,

Many forms of agricultural and silvicultural land management involve the creation of artificial waterbodies. For 
example, ditches are often used for land drainage or irrigation; small constructed ponds are used for small scale 
irrigation or as a water source for livestock; and canal systems are used for water level management, water transfers 
and navigation. Aquaculture ponds and flooded pastures can occupy extensive areas on the landscape (Yang et al. 
2017), (Kroeger et al. 2017). In settlements ponds may be created for recreation, aesthetics or stormwater 
management. 
Similar to reservoirs, CO2 emissions from smaller volume constructed waterbodies including ditches, canals, farm 
ponds and aquaculture ponds, are the result of decomposition of soil organic matter and other organic matter within 
the waterbody or entering the water from the catchment, as well as from biological components (e.g. fish). No 
guidance is provided here since these emissions are either estimated elsewhere (e.g. as soil carbon loss) or represent 
short-term natural carbon cycling (e.g. biological turnover). 
CH4 emissions from small constructed waterbodies are primarily the result of new methanogenic production of 
CH4 induced by anoxic conditions, which occurs when waterbodies have high organic matter loading and low 
oxygen status. These conditions often occur in small constructed waterbodies, such as slow-flowing ditches (Evans 
et al. 2016), agricultural ponds (Selvam et al. 2014) and aquaculture ponds (Robb et al. 2017), but may be lower 
where mixing or aeration occurs as part of aquaculture management (e.g. (Vasanth et al. 2016) and are sensitive 
to temperatures (Davidson et al. 2011).  Area-specific emissions from these constructed waterbodies may equal or 
exceed those observed in small lakes and reservoirs (Bastviken et al. 2010); see above). Furthermore, the CH4 
emissions from small constructed waterbodies are a direct consequence of the construction of the waterbody. 
CH4 emission factors from small constructed waterbodies (Section 7.3.1.2, Table 7.12) are based on review of the 
peer reviewed literature using appropriate search terms. Literature was obtained using Web of Science and Google 
Scholar. In some cases (e.g. PhD Theses), data were obtained directly from authors. For each study or sites within 
studies, a mean CH4 flux was extracted from tables, figures or text. Fluxes were converted to annual fluxes by 
simple scaling (e.g. multiplying per day rates by 365 days), or if more information was provided (e.g. days per 
aquaculture production cycle and production cycles per year), data were annualized using this additional 
information. Methane emissions from land and water surfaces are rarely normally distributed within datasets due 
to the heterogeneity of emission pathways and controlling factors, and data were therefore log-transformed during 
the calculation of mean emission factors. The high variability and relatively small number of observations also 
precluded estimation of separate Tier 1 EFs by climate zone or other factors (apart from waterbody type and (for 
ponds) salinity), and 95% confidence intervals are correspondingly large.
