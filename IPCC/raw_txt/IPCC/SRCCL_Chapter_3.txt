Desertification 
Chapter 3

Executive summary
Desertification is land degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry 
sub-humid areas, collectively known as drylands, resulting 
from many factors, including human activities and climatic 
variations. The range and intensity of desertification have 
increased in some dryland areas over the past several 
decades (high confidence). Drylands currently cover about 46.2% 
(±0.8%) of the global land area and are home to 3 billion people. 
The multiplicity and complexity of the processes of desertification 
make its quantification difficult. Desertification hotspots, as 
identified by a  decline in vegetation productivity between the 
1980s and 2000s, extended to about  9.2% of drylands (±0.5%), 
affecting about 500 (±120) million people in 2015. The highest 
numbers of people affected are in South and East Asia, the 
circum Sahara region including North Africa and the Middle East 
including the Arabian Peninsula (low confidence). Other dryland 
regions have also experienced desertification. Desertification 
has already reduced agricultural productivity and incomes (high 
confidence) and contributed to the loss of biodiversity in some 
dryland regions (medium confidence). In many dryland areas, 
spread of invasive plants has led to losses in ecosystem services 
(high confidence), while over-extraction is leading to groundwater 
depletion (high confidence). Unsustainable land management, 
particularly when coupled with droughts, has contributed to 
higher dust-storm activity, reducing human well-being in drylands 
and beyond (high confidence). Dust storms were associated with 
global cardiopulmonary mortality of about 402,000 people in 
2005. Higher intensity of sand storms and sand dune movements 
are causing disruption and damage to transportation and solar 
and wind energy harvesting infrastructures (high confidence). 
{3.1.1, 3.1.4, 3.2.1, 3.3.1, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.2, 3.7.3, 3.7.4} 
Attribution of desertification to climate variability and 
change, and to human activities, varies in space and time (high 
confidence). Climate variability and anthropogenic climate change, 
particularly through increases in both land surface air temperature 
and evapotranspiration, and decreases in precipitation, are likely to 
have played a role, in interaction with human activities, in causing 
desertification in some dryland areas. The major human drivers of 
desertification interacting with climate change are expansion of 
croplands, unsustainable land management practices and increased 
pressure on land from population and income growth. Poverty is 
limiting both capacities to adapt to climate change and availability of 
financial resources to invest in sustainable land management (SLM) 
(high confidence). {3.1.4, 3.2.2, 3.4.2}
Climate change will exacerbate several desertification 
processes (medium confidence). Although CO2 fertilisation effect 
is enhancing vegetation productivity in drylands (high confidence), 
decreases in water availability have a  larger effect than CO2 
fertilisation in many dryland areas. There is high confidence that 
aridity will increase in some places, but no evidence for a projected 
global trend in dryland aridity (medium confidence). The area at risk 
of salinisation is projected to increase in the future (limited evidence, 
high agreement). Future climate change is projected to increase the 
potential for water driven soil erosion in many dryland areas (medium 
confidence), leading to soil organic carbon decline in some dryland 
areas. {3.1.1, 3.2.2, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.3}
Risks from desertification are projected to increase due to 
climate change (high confidence). Under shared socio-economic 
pathway SSP2 (‘Middle of the Road’) at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global 
warming, the number of dryland population exposed (vulnerable) to 
various impacts related to water, energy and land sectors (e.g., water 
stress, drought intensity, habitat degradation) is projected to reach 951 
(178) million, 1152 (220) million and 1285 (277) million, respectively. 
While at global warming of 2°C, under SSP1 (‘Sustainability’), the 
exposed (vulnerable) dryland population is 974 (35) million, and 
under SSP3 (‘Fragmented World’) it is 1267 (522) million. Around half 
of the vulnerable population is in South Asia, followed by Central 
Asia, West Africa and East Asia. {2.2, 3.1.1, 3.2.2, 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 7.2.2} 
Desertification and climate change, both individually and in 
combination, will reduce the provision of dryland ecosystem 
services and lower ecosystem health, including losses in 
biodiversity (high confidence). Desertification and changing 
climate are projected to cause reductions in crop and livestock 
productivity (high confidence), modify the composition of plant 
species and reduce biological diversity across drylands (medium 
confidence). Rising CO2 levels will favour more rapid expansion 
of some invasive plant species in some regions. A reduction in the 
quality and quantity of resources available to herbivores can have 
knock-on consequences for predators, which can potentially lead to 
disruptive ecological cascades (limited evidence, low agreement). 
Projected increases in temperature and the severity of drought 
events across some dryland areas can increase chances of wildfire 
occurrence (medium confidence). {3.1.4, 3.4.1, 3.5.2, 3.7.3}
Increasing human pressures on land, combined with climate 
change, will reduce the resilience of dryland populations 
and constrain their adaptive capacities (medium confidence). 
The combination of pressures coming from climate variability, 
anthropogenic climate change and desertification will contribute 
to poverty, food insecurity, and increased disease burden (high 
confidence), as well as potentially to conflicts (low confidence). 
Although strong impacts of climate change on migration in dryland 
areas are disputed (medium evidence, low agreement), in some 
places, desertification under changing climate can provide an added 
incentive to migrate (medium confidence). Women will be impacted 
more than men by environmental degradation, particularly in those 
areas with higher dependence on agricultural livelihoods (medium 
evidence, high agreement). {3.4.2, 3.6.2}
Desertification exacerbates climate change through several 
mechanisms such as changes in vegetation cover, sand and 
dust aerosols and greenhouse gas fluxes (high confidence). 
The extent of areas in which dryness (rather than temperature) 
controls CO2 exchange has increased by 6% between 1948 and 
2012, and is projected to increase by at least another 8% by 
2050 if the expansion continues at the same rate. In these 
areas, net carbon uptake is about 27% lower than in other 
areas (low confidence). Desertification also tends to increase 
albedo, decreasing the energy available at the surface and associated 
252

surface temperatures, producing a  negative feedback on climate 
change (high confidence). Through its effect on vegetation and soils, 
desertification changes the absorption and release of associated 
greenhouse gases (GHGs). Vegetation loss and drying of surface 
cover due to desertification increases the frequency of dust storms 
(high confidence). Arid ecosystems could be an important global 
carbon sink, depending on soil water availability (medium evidence, 
high agreement). {3.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.5.2}
Site and regionally-specific technological solutions, based 
both on new scientific innovations and indigenous and local 
knowledge (ILK), are available to avoid, reduce and reverse 
desertification, simultaneously contributing to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation (high confidence). SLM practices in 
drylands increase agricultural productivity and contribute to climate 
change adaptation with mitigation co-benefits (high confidence). 
Integrated crop, soil and water management measures can be 
employed to reduce soil degradation and increase the resilience of 
agricultural production systems to the impacts of climate change 
(high confidence). These measures include crop diversification 
and adoption of drought-resilient econogically appropriate plants, 
reduced tillage, adoption of improved irrigation techniques (e.g., drip 
irrigation) and moisture conservation methods (e.g.,  rainwater 
harvesting using indigenous and local practices), and maintaining 
vegetation and mulch cover. Conservation agriculture increases the 
capacity of agricultural households to adapt to climate change (high 
confidence) and can lead to increases in soil organic carbon over 
time, with quantitative estimates of the rates of carbon sequestration 
in drylands following changes in agricultural practices ranging 
between  0.04 and  0.4 t  ha–1 (medium confidence). Rangeland 
management systems based on sustainable grazing and re-vegetation 
increase rangeland productivity and the flow of ecosystem services 
(high confidence). The combined use of salt-tolerant crops, improved 
irrigation practices, chemical remediation measures and appropriate 
mulch and compost is effective in reducing the impact of secondary 
salinisation (medium confidence). Application of sand dune 
stabilisation techniques contributes to reducing sand and dust storms 
(high confidence). Agroforestry practices and shelterbelts help reduce 
soil erosion and sequester carbon. Afforestation programmes aimed 
at creating windbreaks in the form of ‘green walls’ and ‘green dams’ 
can help stabilise and reduce dust storms, avert wind erosion, and 
serve as carbon sinks, particularly when done with locally adapted 
native and other climate resilient tree species (high confidence). 
{3.4.2, 3.6.1, 3.7.2}
Investments into SLM, land restoration and rehabilitation in 
dryland areas have positive economic returns (high confidence). 
Each USD invested into land restoration can have social returns 
of about 3–6 USD over a 30-year period. Most SLM practices can 
become financially profitable within 3 to 10 years (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Despite their benefits in addressing desertification, 
mitigating and adapting to climate change, and increasing food 
and economic security, many SLM practices are not widely adopted 
due to insecure land tenure, lack of access to credit and agricultural 
advisory services, and insufficient incentives for private land-users 
(robust evidence, high agreement). {3.6.3}
ILK often contributes to enhancing resilience against climate 
change and combating desertification (medium confidence). 
Dryland populations have developed traditional agroecological 
practices which are well adapted to resource-sparse dryland 
environments. However, there is robust evidence documenting losses 
of traditional agroecological knowledge. Traditional agroecological 
practices are also increasingly unable to cope with growing demand 
for food. Combined use of ILK and new SLM technologies can 
contribute to raising the resilience to the challenges of climate 
change and desertification (high confidence). {3.1.3, 3.6.1, 3.6.2}
Policy frameworks promoting the adoption of SLM solutions 
contribute to addressing desertification as well as mitigating 
and adapting to climate change, with co-benefits for poverty 
eradication and food security among dryland populations (high 
confidence). Implementation of Land Degradation Neutrality 
policies allows populations to avoid, reduce and reverse 
desertification, thus contributing to climate change adaptation 
with mitigation co-benefits (high confidence). Strengthening land 
tenure security is a major factor contributing to the adoption of soil 
conservation measures in croplands (high confidence). On-farm and 
off-farm livelihood diversification strategies increase the resilience of 
rural households against desertification and extreme weather events, 
such as droughts (high confidence). Strengthening collective action 
is important for addressing causes and impacts of desertification, 
and for adapting to climate change (medium confidence). A greater 
emphasis on understanding gender-specific differences over land 
use and land management practices can help make land restoration 
projects more successful (medium confidence). Improved access to 
markets raises agricultural profitability and motivates investment into 
climate change adaptation and SLM (medium confidence). Payments 
for ecosystem services give additional incentives to land users to 
adopt SLM practices (medium confidence). Expanding access to rural 
advisory services increases the knowledge on SLM and facilitates 
their wider adoption (medium confidence). Developing, enabling 
and promoting access to cleaner energy sources and technologies 
can contribute to reducing desertification and mitigating climate 
change through decreasing the use of fuelwood and crop residues for 
energy (medium confidence). Policy responses to droughts based on 
proactive drought preparedness and drought risk mitigation are more 
efficient in limiting drought-caused damages than reactive drought 
relief efforts (high confidence). {3.4.2,  3.6.2,  3.6.3, Cross-Chapter 
Box 5 in this chapter}
The knowledge on limits of adaptation to the combined 
effects of climate change and desertification is insufficient. 
However, the potential for residual risks and maladaptive 
outcomes is high (high confidence). Empirical evidence on the 
limits to adaptation in dryland areas is limited. Potential limits to 
adaptation include losses of land productivity due to irreversible 
forms of desertification. Residual risks can emerge from the 
inability of SLM measures to fully compensate for yield losses due 
to climate change impacts. They also arise from foregone reductions 
in ecosystem services due to soil fertility loss even when applying 
SLM measures could revert land to initial productivity after some 
time. Some activities favouring agricultural intensification in dryland 
areas can become maladaptive due to their negative impacts on the 
253

environment (medium confidence) Even when solutions are available, 
social, economic and institutional constraints could pose barriers to 
their implementation (medium confidence). {3.6.4} 
Improving capacities, providing higher access to climate 
services, including local-level early warning systems, and 
expanding the use of remote sensing technologies are 
high-return investments for enabling effective adaptation 
and mitigation responses that help address desertification 
(high confidence). Reliable and timely climate services, relevant to 
desertification, can aid the development of appropriate adaptation 
and mitigation options reducing, the impact of desertification on 
human and natural systems (high confidence), with quantitative 
estimates showing that every USD invested in strengthening 
hydro-meteorological and early warning services in developing 
countries can yield between 4  and 35 USD (low confidence). 
Knowledge and flow of knowledge on desertification is currently 
fragmented. Improved knowledge and data exchange and sharing 
will increase the effectiveness of efforts to achieve Land Degradation 
Neutrality (high confidence). Expanded use of remotely sensed 
information for data collection helps in measuring progress 
towards achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (low evidence, high 
agreement). {3.2.1, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter}

Desertifi cation

1.1 
The nature of desertifi cation 
1.1.1 
Introduction 
In this report, desertifi cation is defi ned as land degradation in 
arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from many 
factors, including climatic variations and human activities (United 
Nations Convention to Combat Desertifi cation (UNCCD) 1994). 
Land degradation is a negative trend in land condition, caused by 
direct or indirect human-induced processes including anthropogenic 
climate change, expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least 
one of the following: biological productivity, ecological integrity or 
value to humans (Section 4.1.3). Arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid 
areas, together with hyper-arid areas, constitute drylands (UNEP 
1992), home to about 3 billion people (van der Esch et al. 2017). 
The difference between desertifi cation and land degradation is 
not process-based but geographic. Although land degradation can 
occur anywhere across the world, when it occurs in drylands, it is 
considered desertifi cation (FAQ 1.3). Desertifi cation is not limited to 
irreversible forms of land degradation, nor is it equated to desert 
expansion, but represents all forms and levels of land degradation 
occurring in drylands. 
The ge ographic classifi cation of drylands is often based on the aridity 
index (AI) – the ratio of average annual precipitation amount (P) to 
potential evapotranspiration amount (PET, see Glossary) (Figure 3.1). 
Recent estimates, based on AI, suggest that drylands cover about 
46.2% (±0.8%) of the global land area (Koutroulis 2019; Prăvălie 
2016) (low confi dence). Hyper-arid areas, where the aridity index 
is below 0.05, are included in drylands, but are excluded from the 
defi nition of desertifi cation (UNCCD 1994). Deserts are valuable 
ecosystems (UNEP 2006; Safriel 2009) geographically located in 
drylands and vulnerable to climate change. However, they are not 
considered prone to desertifi cation. Aridity is a long-term climatic 
feature characterised by low average precipitation or available water 
(Gbeckor-Kove 1989; Türkeş 1999). Thus, aridity is different from 
drought, which is a temporary climatic event (Maliva and Missimer 
2012). Moreover, droughts are not restricted to drylands, but occur 
both in drylands and humid areas (Wilhite et al. 2014). Following the 
Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), 
drought is defi ned here as “a period of abnormally dry weather long 
enough to cause a  serious hydrological imbalance” (Mach et al. 
2014) (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter).
AI is not an accurate proxy for delineating drylands in an increasing 
CO2 environment (Section  3.2.1). The suggestion that most of 
the world has become more arid, since the AI has decreased, is 
not supported by changes observed in precipitation, evaporation 
or drought (Sheffi eld et al. 2012; Greve et al. 2014). While climate 
change is expected to decrease the AI due to increases in potential 
evaporation, the assumptions that underpin the potential evaporation 
calculation are not consistent with a changing CO2 environment and 
the effect this has on transpiration rates (Roderick et al. 2015; Milly 
and Dunne 2016; Greve et al. 2017) (Section 3.2.1). Given that future 
climate is characterised by signifi cant increases in CO2, the usefulness 
of currently applied AI thresholds to estimate dryland areas is limited 
under climate change. If instead of the AI, other variables such as 
precipitation, soil moisture, and primary productivity are used to 
identify dryland areas, there is no clear indication that the extent of 
drylands will change overall under climate change (Roderick et al. 
2015; Greve et al. 2017; Lemordant et al. 2018). Thus, some dryland 
borders will expand, while some others will contract (high confi dence).
Approximately 70% of dryland areas are located in Africa and Asia 
(Figure 3.2). The biggest land use/cover in terms of area in drylands, if 
deserts are excluded, are grasslands, followed by forests and croplands 
(Figure 3.3). The category of ‘other lands’ in Figure 3.3 includes bare 
soil, ice, rock, and all other land areas that are not included within 
the other fi ve categories (FAO 2016). Thus, hyper-arid areas contain 
mostly deserts, with some small exceptions, for example, where 
grasslands and croplands are cultivated under oasis conditions with 
irrigation (Section 3.7.4). Moreover, FAO (2016) defi nes grasslands as 
permanent pastures and meadows used continuously for more than 
fi ve years. In drylands, transhumance, i.e. seasonal migratory grazing, 
Fi gure 3.1 |  Geographical distribution of drylands, delimited based on the aridity index (AI). The classifi cation of AI is: Humid AI > 0.65, Dry sub-humid 0.50 < AI 
≤ 0.65, Semi-arid 0.20 < AI ≤ 0.50, Arid 0.05 < AI ≤ 0.20, Hyper-arid AI < 0.05. Data: TerraClimate precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (1980–2015) (Abatzoglou 
et al. 2018).

often leads to non-permanent pasture systems, thus some of the 
areas under the ‘other land’ category are also used as non-permanent 
pastures (Ramankutty et al. 2008; Fetzel et al. 2017; Erb et al. 2016).
In the earlier global assessments of desertification (since the 1970s), 
which were based on qualitative expert evaluations, the extent of 
desertification was found to range between  4% and 70% of the 
area of drylands (Safriel 2007). More recent estimates, based on 
remotely sensed data, show that about 24–29% of the global land 
area experienced reductions in biomass productivity between the 
1980s and 2000s (Bai et al. 2008; Le et al. 2016), corresponding to 
about 9.2% of drylands (±0.5%) experiencing declines in biomass 
productivity during this period (low confidence), mainly due to 
anthropogenic causes. Both of these studies consider rainfall 
dynamics, thus, accounting for the effect of droughts. While less than 
10% of drylands is undergoing desertification, it is occurring in areas 
that contain around 20% of dryland population (Klein Goldewijk et al. 
2017). In these areas the population has increased from approximately 
172 million in 1950 to over 630 million today (Figure 1.1). 
Available assessments of the global extent and severity of 
desertification are relatively crude approximations with considerable 
uncertainties, for example, due to confounding effects of invasive bush 
encroachment in some dryland regions. Different indicator sets and 
approaches have been developed for monitoring and assessment of 
desertification from national to global scales (Imeson 2012; Sommer 
et al. 2011; Zucca et al. 2012; Bestelmeyer et al. 2013). Many indicators 
of desertification only include a  single factor or characteristic of 
desertification, such as the patch size distribution of vegetation 
(Maestre and Escudero 2009; Kéfi et al. 2010), Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Piao et al. 2005), drought-tolerant plant 
species (An et al. 2007), grass cover (Bestelmeyer et al. 2013), land 
productivity dynamics (Baskan et al. 2017), ecosystem net primary 
productivity (Zhou et al. 2015) or Environmentally Sensitive Land Area 
Index (Symeonakis et al. 2016). In addition, some synthetic indicators 
of desertification have also been used to assess desertification extent 
and desertification processes, such as climate, land use, soil, and 
socio-economic parameters (Dharumarajan et al. 2018), or changes 
in climate, land use, vegetation cover, soil properties and population 
as the desertification vulnerability index (Salvati et al. 2009). Current 
data availability and methodological challenges do not allow for 
accurately and comprehensively mapping desertification at a global 
scale (Cherlet et al. 2018). However, the emerging partial evidence 
points to a  lower global extent of desertification than previously 
estimated (medium confidence) (Section 3.2).
This assessment examines the socio-ecological links between 
drivers (Section  3.1) and feedbacks (Section  3.3) that influence 
desertification–climate change interactions, and then examines 
associated observed and projected impacts (Sections 3.4 and 3.5) 
and responses (Section  3.6). Moreover, this assessment highlights 
that dryland populations are highly vulnerable to desertification and 
climate change (Sections  3.2 and  3.4). At the same time, dryland 
populations also have significant past experience and sources of 
resilience embodied in indigenous and local knowledge and practices 
in order to successfully adapt to climatic changes and address 
desertification (Section  3.6). Numerous site-specific technological 
response options are also available for SLM in drylands that can help 
increase the resilience of agricultural livelihood systems to climate 
change (Section 3.6). However, continuing environmental degradation 
combined with climate change is straining the resilience of dryland 
populations. Enabling policy responses for SLM and livelihoods

diversification can help maintain and strengthen the resilience and 
adaptive capacities in dryland areas (Section 3.6). The assessment 
finds that policies promoting SLM in drylands will contribute to 
climate change adaptation and mitigation, with co-benefits for 
broader sustainable development (high confidence) (Section 3.4).
1.1.2 
Desertification in previous IPCC  
and related reports
The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and Special Report on Global 
Warming of 1.5°C include a limited discussion of desertification. In 
AR5 Working Group I desertification is mentioned as a forcing agent 
for the production of atmospheric dust (Myhre et al. 2013). The same 
report had low confidence in the available projections on the changes 
in dust loadings due to climate change (Boucher et al. 2013). In AR5 
Working Group II desertification is identified as a process that can 
lead to reductions in crop yields and the resilience of agricultural and 
pastoral livelihoods (Field et al. 2014; Klein et al. 2015). AR5 Working 
Group II notes that climate change will amplify water scarcity, with 
negative impacts on agricultural systems, particularly in semi-arid 
environments of Africa (high confidence), while droughts could 
exacerbate desertification in southwestern parts of Central Asia 
(Field et al. 2014). AR5 Working Group III identifies desertification 
as one of a number of often overlapping issues that must be dealt 
with when considering governance of mitigation and adaptation 
(Fleurbaey et al. 2014). The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming 
of 1.5°C noted that limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C 
is strongly beneficial for land ecosystems and their services (high 
confidence) such as soil conservation, contributing to avoidance of 
desertification (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018).
The recent Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity 
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Land Degradation and Restoration 
Assessment report (IPBES 2018a) is also of particular relevance. 
While acknowledging a wide variety of past estimates of the area 
undergoing degradation, IPBES (2018a) pointed at their lack of 
agreement about where degradation is taking place. IPBES (2018a) 
also recognised the challenges associated with differentiating the 
impacts of climate variability and change on land degradation from 
the impacts of human activities at a regional or global scale. 
The third edition of the World Atlas of Desertification (Cherlet et al. 
2018) indicated that it is not possible to deterministically map the 
global extent of land degradation – and its subset, desertification – 
pointing out that the complexity of interactions between social, 
economic, and environmental systems make land degradation not 
amenable to mapping at a global scale. Instead, Cherlet et al. (2018) 
presented global maps highlighting the convergence of various 
pressures on land resources. 
1.1.3 
Dryland populations: Vulnerability and resilience 
Drylands are home to approximately 38.2% (±0.6%) of the global 
population (Koutroulis 2019; van der Esch et al. 2017), that is about 
3 billion people. The highest number of people live in the drylands 
of South Asia (Figure  3.4), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa and 
Latin America (van der Esch et al. 2017). In terms of the number of 
people affected by desertification, Reynolds et al. (2007) indicated 
that desertification was directly affecting 250 million people. More 
recent estimates show that 500 (±120) million people lived in 2015 
in those dryland areas which experienced significant loss in biomass

productivity between the 1980s and 2000s (Bai et al. 2008; Le et al. 
2016). The highest numbers of affected people were in South and 
East Asia, North Africa and the Middle East (low confidence). The 
population in drylands is projected to increase about twice as rapidly 
as non-drylands, reaching 4  billion people by 2050 (van der Esch 
et al. 2017). This is due to higher population growth rates in drylands. 
About 90% of the population in drylands live in developing countries 
(UN-EMG 2011). 
Dryland populations are highly vulnerable to desertification and 
climate change because their livelihoods are predominantly 
dependent on agriculture, one of the sectors most susceptible to 
climate change (Rosenzweig et al. 2014; Schlenker and Lobell 2010). 
Climate change is projected to have substantial impacts on all types 
of agricultural livelihood systems in drylands (CGIAR-RPDS 2014) 
(Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2).
One key vulnerable group in drylands are pastoral and agropastoral 
households.1 There are no precise figures about the number of people 
practicing pastoralism globally. Most estimates range between 
100 million and 200 million (Rass 2006; Secretariat of the Convention 
on Biological Diversity 2010), of whom 30–63  million are nomadic 
pastoralists (Dong 2016; Carr-Hill 2013).2 Pastoral production systems 
represent an adaptation to high seasonal climate variability and low 
biomass productivity in dryland ecosystems (Varghese and Singh 2016; 
Krätli and Schareika 2010), which require large areas for livestock 
grazing through migratory pastoralism (Snorek et al. 2014). Grazing 
lands across dryland environments are being degraded, and/or being 
converted to crop production, limiting the opportunities for migratory 
livestock systems, and leading to conflicts with sedentary crop producers 
(Abbass 2014; Dimelu et al. 2016). These processes, coupled with 
ethnic differences, perceived security threats, and misunderstanding of 
pastoral rationality, have led to increasing marginalisation of pastoral 
1 
Pastoralists derive more than 50% of their income from livestock and livestock products, whereas agropastoralists generate more than 50% of their income from crop 
production and at least 25% from livestock production (Swift, 1988).

The estimates of the number of pastoralists, and especially of nomadic pastoralists, are very uncertain, because often nomadic pastoralists are not fully captured in national 
surveys and censuses (Carr-Hill, 2013).
communities and disruption of their economic and cultural structures 
(Elhadary 2014; Morton 2010). As a result, pastoral communities are 
not well prepared to deal with increasing weather/climate variability 
and weather/climate extremes due to changing climate (Dong 2016; 
López-i-Gelats et al. 2016), and remain amongst the most food insecure 
groups in the world (FAO 2018).
There is an increasing concentration of poverty in the dryland areas 
of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (von Braun and Gatzweiler 
2014; Barbier and Hochard 2016), where 41% and 12% of the total 
populations live in extreme poverty, respectively (World Bank 2018). 
For comparison, the average share of global population living in 
extreme poverty is about 10% (World Bank 2018). Multidimensional 
poverty, prevalent in many dryland areas, is a  key source of 
vulnerability (Safriel et al. 2005; Thornton et al. 2014; Fraser et al. 
2011; Thomas 2008). Multidimensional poverty incorporates both 
income-based poverty, and also other dimensions such as poor 
healthcare services, lack of education, lack of access to water, 
sanitation and energy, disempowerment, and threat from violence 
(Bourguignon and Chakravarty 2003; Alkire and Santos 2010, 2014). 
Contributing elements to this multidimensional poverty in drylands 
are rapid population growth, fragile institutional environment, lack of 
infrastructure, geographic isolation and low market access, insecure 
land tenure systems, and low agricultural productivity (Sietz et al. 
2011; Reynolds et al. 2011; Safriel and Adeel 2008; Stafford Smith 
2016). Even in high-income countries, those dryland areas that depend 
on agricultural livelihoods represent relatively poorer locations 
nationally, with fewer livelihood opportunities, for example in Italy 
(Salvati 2014). Moreover, in many drylands areas, female-headed 
households, women and subsistence farmers (both male and 
female) are more vulnerable to the impacts of desertification and 
climate change (Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr 2015; Sultana 
2014; Rahman 2013). Some local cultural traditions and patriarchal

relationships were found to contribute to higher vulnerability of 
women and female-headed households through restrictions on their 
access to productive resources (Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner-Kerr 
2015; Sultana 2014; Rahman 2013) (Sections 3.4.2 and 3.6.3, and 
Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7). 
Despite these environmental, socio-economic and institutional 
constraints, dryland populations have historically demonstrated 
remarkable resilience, ingenuity and innovations, distilled into ILK to 
cope with high climatic variability and sustain livelihoods (Safriel and 
Adeel 2008; Davis 2016; Davies 2017) (Sections 3.6.1 and 3.6.2, and 
Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 7). For example, across the Arabian 
Peninsula and North Africa, informal community by-laws were 
successfully used for regulating grazing, collection and cutting of 
herbs and wood, and which limited rangeland degradation (Gari 2006; 
Hussein 2011). Pastoralists in Mongolia developed indigenous 
classifications of pasture resources which facilitated ecologically 
optimal grazing practices (Fernandez-Gimenez 2000) (Section 3.6.2). 
Currently, however, indigenous and local knowledge and practices 
are increasingly lost or can no longer cope with growing demands for 
land-based resources (Dominguez 2014; Fernández-Giménez and Fillat 
Estaque 2012; Hussein 2011; Kodirekkala 2017; Moreno-Calles et al. 
2012) (Section 3.4.2). Unsustainable land management is increasing 
the risks from droughts, floods and dust storms (Sections  3.4.2 
and 3.5). Policy actions promoting the adoption of SLM practices in 
dryland areas, based on both indigenous and local knowledge and 
modern science, and expanding alternative livelihood opportunities 
outside agriculture can contribute to climate change adaptation and 
mitigation, addressing desertification, with co-benefits for poverty 
eradication and food security (high confidence) (Cowie et al. 2018; 
Liniger et al. 2017; Safriel and Adeel 2008; Stafford-Smith et al. 2017).
1.1.4 
Processes and drivers of desertification  
under climate change 
1.1.4.1 
Processes of desertification and their climatic drivers
Processes of desertification are mechanisms by which drylands 
are degraded. Desertification consists of both biological and 
non-biological processes. These processes are classified under 
broad categories of degradation of physical, chemical and biological 
properties of terrestrial ecosystems. The number of desertification 
processes is large and they are extensively covered elsewhere 
(IPBES 2018a; Lal 2016; Racine 2008; UNCCD 2017). Section 4.2.1 
and Tables  4.1 and  4.2 in Chapter  4  highlight those which are 
particularly relevant for this assessment in terms of their links to 
climate change and land degradation, including desertification. 
Drivers of desertification are factors which trigger desertification 
processes. Initial studies of desertification during the early-to-mid 
20th century attributed it entirely to human activities. In one of the 
influential publications of that time, Lavauden (1927) stated that: 
“Desertification is purely artificial. It is only the act of the man…” 
However, such a  uni-causal view of desertification was shown to 
be invalid (Geist et al. 2004; Reynolds et al. 2007) (Sections 3.1.4.2 
and 3.1.4.3). Tables 4.1 and 4.2 in Chapter 4 summarise the drivers, 
linking them to the specific processes of desertification and land 
degradation under changing climate. 
Erosion refers to removal of soil by the physical forces of water, 
wind, or often caused by farming activities such as tillage (Ginoux 
et al. 2012). The global estimates of soil erosion differ significantly, 
depending on scale, study period and method used (García-Ruiz et al. 
2015), ranging from approximately 20 Gt yr–1 to more than 200 Gt yr–1 
(Boix-Fayos et al. 2006; FAO 2015). There is a significant potential for 
climate change to increase soil erosion by water, particularly in those 
regions where precipitation volumes and intensity are projected to 
increase (Panthou et al. 2014; Nearing et al. 2015). On the other 
hand, while it is a dominant form of erosion in areas such as West 
Asia and the Arabian Peninsula (Prakash et al. 2015; Klingmüller et al. 
2016), there is limited evidence concerning climate change impacts 
on wind erosion (Tables 4.1 and 4.2 in Chapter 4, and Section 3.5). 
Saline and sodic soils (see Glossary) occur naturally in arid, 
semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions of the world. Climate change 
or hydrological change can cause soil salinisation by increasing 
the mineralised groundwater level. However, secondary salinisation 
occurs when the concentration of dissolved salts in water and soil 
is increased by anthropogenic processes, mainly through poorly 
managed irrigation schemes. The threat of soil and groundwater 
salinisation induced by sea level rise and seawater intrusion are 
amplified by climate change (Section 4.9.7). 
Global warming is expected to accelerate soil organic carbon 
(SOC) turnover, since the decomposition of the soil organic matter 
by microbial activity begins with low soil water availability, 
but this moisture is insufficient for plant productivity (Austin 
et al. 2004) (Section 3.4.1.1). SOC is also lost due to soil erosion 
(Lal 2009); therefore, in some dryland areas leading to SOC decline 
(Sections 3.3.3 and 3.5.2) and the transfer of carbon (C) from soil to 
the atmosphere (Lal 2009). 
Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies can drive rainfall changes, 
with implications for desertification processes. North Atlantic SST 
anomalies are positively correlated with Sahel rainfall anomalies 
(Knight et al. 2006; Gonzalez-Martin et al. 2014; Sheen et al. 2017). 
While the eastern tropical Pacific SST anomalies have a negative 
correlation with Sahel rainfall (Pomposi et al. 2016), a  cooler 
North Atlantic is related to a  drier Sahel, with this relationship 
enhanced if there is a simultaneous relative warming of the South 
Atlantic (Hoerling et al. 2006). Huber and Fensholt (2011) explored 
the relationship between SST anomalies and satellite observed 
Sahel vegetation dynamics, finding similar relationships but with 
substantial west–east variations in both the significant SST regions 
and the vegetation response. Concerning the paleoclimatic evidence 
on aridification after the early Holocene ‘Green Sahara’ period 
(11,000 to 5000 years ago), Tierney et al. (2017) indicate that 
a cooling of the North Atlantic played a role (Collins et al. 2017; 
Otto-Bliesner et al. 2014; Niedermeyer et al. 2009) similar to that 
found in modern observations. Besides these SST relationships, 
aerosols have also been suggested as a  potential driver of the 
Sahel droughts (Rotstayn and Lohmann 2002; Booth et al. 2012; 
Ackerley et al. 2011). For eastern Africa, both recent droughts and

decadal declines have been linked to human-induced warming in 
the western Pacific (Funk et al. 2018).
Invasive plants contributed to desertification and loss of ecosystem 
services in many dryland areas in the last century (high confidence) 
(Section 3.7.3). Extensive woody plant encroachment altered runoff 
and soil erosion across much of the drylands, because the bare 
soil between shrubs is very susceptible to water erosion, mainly in 
high-intensity rainfall events (Manjoro et al. 2012; Pierson et al. 2013; 
Eldridge et al. 2015). Rising CO2 levels due to global warming favour 
more rapid expansion of some invasive plant species in some regions. 
An example is the Great Basin region in western North America 
where over 20% of ecosystems have been significantly altered 
by invasive plants, especially exotic annual grasses and invasive 
conifers, resulting in loss of biodiversity. This land-cover conversion 
has resulted in reductions in forage availability, wildlife habitat, and 
biodiversity (Pierson et al. 2011, 2013; Miller et al. 2013).
The wildfire is a driver of desertification, because it reduces vegetation 
cover, increases runoff and soil erosion, reduces soil fertility and 
affects the soil microbial community (Vega et al. 2005; Nyman et al. 
2010; Holden et al. 2013; Pourreza et al. 2014; Weber et al. 2014; 
Liu and Wimberly 2016). Predicted increases in temperature and the 
severity of drought events across some dryland areas (Section 2.2) 
can increase chances of wildfire occurrence (medium confidence) 
(Jolly et al. 2015; Williams et al. 2010; Clarke and Evans 2018) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2). In semi-arid and dry sub-humid 
areas, fire can have a profound influence on observed vegetation 
and particularly the relative abundance of grasses to woody plants 
(Bond et al. 2003; Bond and Keeley 2005; Balch et al. 2013).
While large uncertainty exists concerning trends in droughts globally 
(AR5) (Section 2.2), examining the drought data by Ziese et al. (2014) 
for drylands only reveals a large inter-annual variability combined 
with a trend toward increasing dryland area affected by droughts 
since the 1950s (Figure 1.1). Thus, over the period 1961 –2013, the 
annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on average, by 
slightly more than 1% per year, with large inter-annual variability. 
1.1.4.2 
Anthropogenic drivers of desertification  
under climate change
The literature on the human drivers of desertification is substantial 
(e.g.,  D’Odorico et al. 2013; Sietz et al. 2011; Yan and Cai 2015; 
Sterk et al. 2016; Varghese and Singh 2016) and there have been 
several comprehensive reviews and assessments of these drivers 
very recently (Cherlet et al. 2018; IPBES 2018a; UNCCD 2017). 
IPBES (2018a) identified cropland expansion, unsustainable land 
management practices including overgrazing by livestock, urban 
expansion, infrastructure development, and extractive industries 
as the main drivers of land degradation. IPBES (2018a) also found 
that the ultimate driver of land degradation is high and growing 
consumption of land-based resources,  e.g.,  through deforestation 
and cropland expansion, escalated by population growth. What is 
particularly relevant in the context of the present assessment is to 
evaluate if, how and which human drivers of desertification will be 
modified by climate change effects. 
Growing food demand is driving conversion of forests, rangelands, 
and woodlands into cropland (Bestelmeyer et al. 2015; D’Odorico et al. 
2013). Climate change is projected to reduce crop yields across dryland 
areas (Sections 3.4.1 and 5.2.2), potentially reducing local production 
of food and feed. Without research breakthroughs mitigating these 
productivity losses through higher agricultural productivity, and 
reducing food waste and loss, meeting the increasing food demands 
of growing populations will require expansion of cropped areas to 
more marginal areas (with most prime areas in drylands already being 
under cultivation) (Lambin 2012; Lambin et al. 2013; Eitelberg et al. 
2015; Gutiérrez-Elorza 2006; Kapović Solomun et al. 2018). Borrelli 
et al. (2017) showed that the primary driver of soil erosion in 2012 
was cropland expansion. Although local food demands could also be 
met by importing from other areas, this would mean increasing the 
pressure on land in those areas (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011). The net 
effects of such global agricultural production shifts on land condition 
in drylands are not known. 
Climate change will exacerbate poverty among some categories 
of dryland populations (Sections  3.4.2 and  3.5.2). Depending on 
the context, this impact comes through declines in agricultural 
productivity, changes in agricultural prices and extreme weather 
events (Hertel and Lobell 2014; Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017). 
There is high confidence that poverty limits both capacities to 
adapt to climate change and availability of financial resources 
to invest into SLM (Gerber et al. 2014; Way 2016; Vu et al. 2014) 
(Sections 3.5.2, 3.6.2 and 3.6.3). 
Labour mobility is another key human driver that will interact with 
climate change. Although strong impacts of climate change on 
migration in dryland areas are disputed, in some places, it is likely to 
provide an added incentive to migrate (Section 3.4.2.7). Out-migration 
will have several contradictory effects on desertification. On one hand, 
it reduces an immediate pressure on land if it leads to less dependence 
on land for livelihoods (Chen et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2016a). Moreover, 
migrant remittances could be used to fund the adoption of SLM 
practices. Labour mobility from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors 
could allow land consolidation, gradually leading to mechanisation 
and agricultural intensification (Wang et al. 2014, 2018). On the other 
hand, this can increase the costs of labour-intensive SLM practices 
due to lower availability of rural agricultural labour and/or higher 
rural wages. Out-migration increases the pressure on land if higher 
wages that rural migrants earn in urban centres will lead to their 
higher food consumption. Moreover, migrant remittances could also 
be used to fund land-use expansion to marginal areas (Taylor et al. 
2016; Gray and Bilsborrow 2014). The net effect of these opposite 
mechanisms varies from place to place (Qin and Liao 2016). There is 
very little literature evaluating these joint effects of climate change, 
desertification and labour mobility (Section 7.3.2).
There are also many other institutional, policy and socio-economic 
drivers of desertification, such as land tenure insecurity, lack of 
property rights, lack of access to markets, and to rural advisory services, 
lack of technical knowledge and skills, agricultural price distortions, 
agricultural support and subsidies contributing to desertification, and 
lack of economic incentives for SLM (D’Odorico et al. 2013; Geist et al. 
2004; Moussa et al. 2016; Mythili and Goedecke 2016; Sow et al. 
260

2016; Tun et al. 2015; García-Ruiz 2010). There is no evidence that 
these factors will be materially affected by climate change, however, 
serving as drivers of unsustainable land management practices, they 
do play a very important role in modulating responses for climate 
change adaptation and mitigation (Section 3.6.3). 
1.1.4.3 
Interaction of drivers: Desertification syndrome versus 
drylands development paradigm 
Two broad narratives have historically emerged to describe 
responses of dryland populations to environmental degradation. The 
first is ‘desertification syndrome’ which describes the vicious cycle 
of resource degradation and poverty, whereby dryland populations 
apply unsustainable agricultural practices leading to desertification, 
and exacerbating their poverty, which then subsequently further 
limits their capacities to invest in SLM (MEA 2005; Safriel and Adeel 
2008). The alternative paradigm is one of ‘drylands development’, 
which refers to social and technical ingenuity of dryland populations 
as a driver of dryland sustainability (MEA 2005; Reynolds et al. 2007; 
Safriel and Adeel 2008). The major difference between these two 
frameworks is that the ‘drylands development’ paradigm recognises 
that human activities are not the sole and/or most important 
drivers of desertification, but there are interactions of human and 
climatic drivers within coupled social-ecological systems (Reynolds 
et al. 2007). This led Behnke and Mortimore (2016), and earlier Swift 
(1996), to conclude that the concept of desertification as irreversible 
degradation distorts policy and governance in dryland areas. 
Mortimore (2016) suggested that instead of externally imposed 
technical solutions, what is needed is for populations in dryland 
areas to adapt to this variable environment which they cannot 
control. All in all, there is high confidence that anthropogenic and 
climatic drivers interact in complex ways in causing desertification. 
As discussed in Section  3.2.2, the relative influence of human or 
climatic drivers on desertification varies from place to place (high 
confidence) (Bestelmeyer et al. 2018; D’Odorico et al. 2013; Geist and 
Lambin 2004; Kok et al. 2016; Polley et al. 2013; Ravi et al. 2010; 
Scholes 2009; Sietz et al. 2017; Sietz et al. 2011). 
1.2 
Observations of desertification 
1.2.1 
Status and trends of desertification 
Current estimates of the extent and severity of desertification vary 
greatly due to missing and/or unreliable information (Gibbs and 
Salmon 2015). The multiplicity and complexity of the processes of 
desertification make its quantification difficult (Prince 2016; Cherlet 
et al. 2018). The most common definition for the drylands is based 
on defined thresholds of the AI (Figure 3.1; UNEP 1992). While past 
studies have used the AI to examine changes in desertification or 
extent of the drylands (Feng and Fu 2013; Zarch et al. 2015; Ji et al. 
2015; Spinoni et al. 2015; Huang et al. 2016; Ramarao et al. 2018), 
this approach has several key limitations: (i) the AI does not measure 
desertification, (ii) the impact of changes in climate on the land 
surface and systems is more complex than assumed by AI, and (iii) the 
relationship between climate change and changes in vegetation 
is complex due to the influence of CO2. Expansion of the drylands 
does not imply desertification by itself, if there is no long-term loss 
of at least one of the following: biological productivity, ecological 
integrity, or value to humans. 
The use of the AI to define changing aridity levels and dryland extent 
in an environment with changing atmospheric CO2 has been strongly 
challenged (Roderick et al. 2015; Milly and Dunne 2016; Greve et al. 
2017; Liu et al. 2017). The suggestion that most of the world has 
become more arid, since the AI has decreased, is not supported by 
changes observed in precipitation, evaporation or drought (medium 
confidence) (Sheffield et al. 2012; Greve et al. 2014). A key issue is 
the assumption in the calculation of potential evapotranspiration 
that stomatal conductance remains constant, which is invalid if 
atmospheric CO2 changes. Given that atmospheric CO2 has been 
increasing over the last century or more, and is projected to continue 
increasing, this means that AI with constant thresholds (or any 
other measure that relies on potential evapotranspiration) is not an 
appropriate way to estimate aridity or dryland extent (Donohue et al. 
2013; Roderick et al. 2015; Greve et al. 2017). This issue helps explain 
the apparent contradiction between the drylands becoming more arid 
according to the AI and also becoming greener according to satellite 
observations (Fensholt et al. 2012; Andela et al. 2013) (Figure 3.5). 
Other climate type classifications based on various combinations of 
temperature and precipitation (Köppen-Trewartha, Köppen-Geiger) 
have also been used to examine historical changes in climate zones, 
finding a  tendency toward drier climate types (Feng  et al. 2014; 
Spinoni et al. 2015).
The need to establish a  baseline when assessing change in the 
land area degraded has been extensively discussed in Prince et al. 
(2018). Desertification is a process, not a state of the system, hence 
an ‘absolute’ baseline is not required; however, every study uses 
a baseline defined by the start of their period of interest.
Depending on the definitions applied and methodologies used 
in evaluation, the status and extent of desertification globally 
and regionally still show substantial variations (high confidence) 
(D’Odorico et al. 2013). There is high confidence that the range 
and intensity of desertification has increased in some dryland areas 
over the past several decades (Sections  3.2.1.1 and  3.2.1.2). The 
three methodological approaches applied for assessing the extent 
of desertification: expert judgement, satellite observation of net 
primary productivity, and use of biophysical models, together provide 
a relatively holistic assessment but none on its own captures the 
whole picture (Gibbs and Salmon 2015; Vogt et al. 2011; Prince 2016) 
(Section 4.2.4).
1.2.1.1 
Global scale
Complex human–environment interactions, coupled with biophysical, 
social, economic and political factors unique to any given location, 
render desertification difficult to map at a global scale (Cherlet et al. 
2018). Early attempts to assess desertification focused on expert 
knowledge in order to obtain global coverage in a  cost-effective 
manner. Expert judgement continues to play an important role 
because degradation remains a subjective feature whose indicators 
are different from place to place (Sonneveld and Dent 2007). GLASOD 
261
Desertifi cation 
Chapter 3

(Global Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation) estimated 
nearly 2000 million hectares (Mha) (15.3% of the total land area) 
had been degraded by the early 1990s since the mid-20th century. 
GLASOD was criticised for perceived subjectiveness and exaggeration 
(Helldén and Tottrup 2008; Sonneveld and Dent 2007). Dregne and 
Chou (1992) found 3000 Mha in drylands (i.e. about 50% of drylands) 
were undergoing degradation. Signifi cant improvements have been 
made through the efforts of WOCAT (World Overview of Conservation 
Approaches and Technologies), LADA (Land Degradation Assessment 
in Drylands) and DESIRE (Desertifi cation Mitigation and Remediation 
of Land) who jointly developed a  mapping tool for participatory 
expert assessment, with which land experts can estimate current 
area coverage, type and trends of land degradation (Reed et al. 2011).
A number of studies have used satellite-based remote sensing
to investigate long-term changes in the vegetation and thus identify 
parts of the drylands undergoing desertifi cation. Satellite data 
provides information at the resolution of the sensor, which can be 
relatively coarse (up to 25 km), and interpretations of the data at 
sub-pixel levels are challenging. The most widely used remotely 
sensed vegetation index is the NDVI, providing a measure of canopy 
greenness that is related to the quantity of standing biomass (Bai et al. 
2008; de Jong et al. 2011; Fensholt et al. 2012; Andela et al. 2013; 
Fensholt et al. 2015; Le et al. 2016) (Figure 3.5). A main challenge 
associated with NDVI is that although biomass and productivity are 
closely related in some systems, they can differ widely when looking 
across land uses and ecosystem types, giving a false positive in some 
instances (Pattison et al. 2015; Aynekulu et al. 2017). For example, 
bush encroachment in rangelands and intensive monocropping 
with high fertiliser application gives an indication of increased 
productivity in satellite data though these could be considered as 
land degradation. According to this measure there are regions 
undergoing desertifi cation, however the drylands are greening on 
average (Figure 3.6).

A simple linear trend in NDVI is an unsuitable measure for dryland 
degradation for several reasons (Wessels et al. 2012; de Jong et al. 
2013; Higginbottom and Symeonakis 2014; Le et al. 2016). NDVI 
is strongly coupled to precipitation in drylands where precipitation 
has high inter-annual variability. This means that NDVI trend can be 
dominated by any precipitation trend and is sensitive to wet or dry 
periods, particularly if they fall near the beginning or end of the time 
series. Degradation may only occur during part of the time series, 
while NDVI is stable or even improving during the rest of the time 
series. This reduces the strength and representativeness of a linear 
trend. Other factors such as CO2 fertilisation also influence the NDVI 
trend. Various techniques have been proposed to address these 
issues, including the residual trends (RESTREND) method to account 
for rainfall variability (Evans and Geerken 2004), time-series break 
point identification methods to find major shifts in the vegetation 
trends (de Jong et al. 2013; Verbesselt et al. 2010a), and methods to 
explicitly account for the effect of CO2 fertilisation (Le et al. 2016).
Using the RESTREND method, Andela et al. (2013) found that human 
activity contributed to a mixture of improving and degrading regions 
in drylands. In some locations these regions differed substantially 
from those identified using the NDVI trend alone, including an 
increase in the area being desertified in southern Africa and northern 
Australia, and a decrease in southeast and western Australia and 
Mongolia. De Jong et al. (2013) examined the NDVI time series for 
major shifts in vegetation activity and found that 74% of drylands 
experienced such a shift between 1981 and 2011. This suggests that 
monotonic linear trends are unsuitable for accurately capturing the 
changes that have occurred in the majority of the drylands. Le et al. 
(2016) explicitly accounted for CO2 fertilisation effect and found 
that the extent of degraded areas in the world is 3% larger when 
compared to the linear NDVI trend. 
Besides NDVI, there are many vegetation indices derived from satellite 
data in the optical and infrared wavelengths. Each of these datasets 
has been derived to overcome some limitation in existing indices. 
Studies have compared vegetation indices globally (Zhang et al. 
2017) and specifically over drylands (Wu 2014). In general, the data 
from these vegetation indices are available only since around 2000, 
while NDVI data is available since 1982. With less than 20 years of 
data, the trend analysis remains problematic with vegetation indices 
other than NDVI. However, given the various advantages in terms of 
resolution and other characteristics, these newer vegetation indices 
will become more useful in the future as more data accumulates. 
A major shortcoming of these studies based on vegetation datasets 
derived from satellite sensors is that they do not account for changes 
in vegetation composition, thus leading to inaccuracies in the 
estimation of the extent of degraded areas in drylands. For example, 
drylands of eastern Africa currently face growing encroachment of 
invasive plant species, such as Prosopis juliflora (Ayanu et al. 2015), 
which constitutes land degradation since it leads to losses in economic 
productivity of affected areas but appears as a greening in the satellite 
data. Another case study in central Senegal found degradation 
manifested through a reduction in species richness despite satellite 
observed greening (Herrmann and Tappan 2013). A  number of 
efforts to identify changes in vegetation composition from satellites 
have been made (Brandt et al. 2016a, b; Evans and Geerken 2006; 
Geerken 2009; Geerken et al. 2005; Verbesselt et al. 2010a, b). These 
depend on well-identified reference NDVI time series for particular 
vegetation groupings, can only differentiate vegetation types that 
have distinct spectral phenology signatures, and require extensive 
ground observations for validation. A  recent alternative approach 
to differentiating woody from herbaceous vegetation  involves the 
combined use of optical/infrared-based vegetation indices, indicating 
greenness, with microwave based Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) 
which is sensitive to both woody and leafy vegetation components 
(Andela et al. 2013; Tian et al. 2017).
Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) has been available since the 1980s. 
VOD is based on microwave measurements and is related to total 
above-ground biomass water content. Unlike NDVI, which is only 
sensitive to green canopy cover, VOD is also sensitive to water 
in woody parts of the vegetation and hence provides a  view of 
vegetation changes that can be complementary to NDVI. Liu et al. 
(2013) used VOD trends to investigate biomass changes and found 
that VOD was closely related to precipitation changes in drylands. To 
complement their work with NDVI, Andela et al. (2013) also applied 
the RESTREND method to VOD. By interpreting NDVI and VOD trends 
together they were able to differentiate changes to the herbaceous 
and woody components of the biomass. They reported that many 
dryland regions are experiencing an increase in the woody fraction 
often associated with shrub encroachment and suggest that this was 
aided by CO2 fertilisation.
Biophysical models use global datasets that describe climate 
patterns and soil groups, combined with observations of land use, 
to define classes of potential productivity and map general land 
degradation (Gibbs and Salmon 2015). All biophysical models have 
their own set of assumptions and limitations that contribute to their 
overall uncertainty, including: model structure; spatial scale; data 
requirements (with associated errors); spatial heterogeneities of 
socio-economic conditions; and agricultural technologies used. Models 
have been used to estimate the vegetation productivity potential 
of land (Cai et al. 2011) and to understand the causes of observed 
vegetation changes. Zhu et al. (2016) used an ensemble of ecosystem 
models to investigate causes of vegetation changes from 1982–2009, 
using a factorial simulation approach. They found CO2 fertilisation to 
be the dominant effect globally, though climate and land-cover change 
were the dominant effects in various dryland locations. Borrelli et al. 
(2017) modelled that about 6.1% of the global land area experienced 
very high soil erosion rates (exceeding 10  Mg ha−1 yr−1) in 2012, 
particularly in South America, Africa, and Asia. 
Overall, improved estimation and mapping of areas undergoing 
desertification are needed. This requires a  combination of rapidly 
expanding sources of remotely sensed data, ground observations 
and new modelling approaches. This is a critical gap, especially in 
the context of measuring progress towards achieving the land 
degradation-neutrality target by 2030 in the framework of SDGs.

Regional scale
While global-scale studies provide information for any region, there 
are numerous studies that focus on sub-continental scales, providing 
more in-depth analysis and understanding. Regional and local studies 
are important to detect location-specific trends in desertification 
and heterogeneous influences of climate change on desertification. 
However, these regional and local studies use a  wide variety of 
methodologies, making direct comparisons difficult. For details of the 
methodologies applied by each study refer to the individual papers.
Africa
It is estimated that 46 of the 54 countries in Africa are vulnerable 
to desertification, with some already affected (Prăvălie 2016). 
Moderate or higher severity degradation over recent decades has 
been identified in many river basins including the Nile (42% of area), 
Niger (50%), Senegal (51%), Volta (67%), Limpopo (66%) and Lake 
Chad (26%) (Thiombiano and Tourino-Soto 2007).
The Horn of Africa is getting drier (Damberg and AghaKouchak 
2014; Marshall et al. 2012) exacerbating the desertification already 
occurring (Oroda 2001). The observed decline in vegetation cover 
is diminishing ecosystem services (Pricope et al. 2013). Based on 
NDVI residuals, Kenya experienced persistent negative (positive) 
trends over 21.6% (8.9%) of the country, for the period 1992–2015 
(Gichenje and Godinho 2018). Fragmentation of habitats, reduction 
in the range of livestock grazing, and higher stocking rates are 
considered to be the main drivers for vegetation structure loss in the 
rangelands of Kenya (Kihiu 2016; Otuoma et al. 2009).
Despite desertification in the Sahel being a  major concern since 
the 1970s, wetting and greening conditions have been observed 
in this region over the last three decades (Anyamba and Tucker 
2005; Huber et al. 2011; Brandt et al. 2015; Rishmawi et al. 2016; 
Tian et al. 2016; Leroux et al. 2017; Herrmann et al. 2005; Damberg 
and AghaKouchak 2014). Cropland areas in the Sahel region of West 
Africa have doubled since 1975, with settlement area increasing by 
about 150% (Traore et al. 2014). Thomas and Nigam (2018) found 
that the Sahara expanded by 10% over the 20th century based on 
annual rainfall. In Burkina Faso, Dimobe et al. (2015) estimated that 
from 1984 to 2013, bare soils and agricultural lands increased by 
18.8% and 89.7%, respectively, while woodland, gallery forest, tree 
savannahs, shrub savannahs and water bodies decreased by 18.8%, 
19.4%, 4.8%, 45.2% and 31.2%, respectively. In Fakara region in 
Niger, a 5% annual reduction in herbaceous yield between 1994 and 
2006 was largely explained by changes in land use, grazing pressure 
and soil fertility (Hiernaux et al. 2009). Aladejana et al. (2018) found 
that between 1986 and 2015, 18.6% of the forest cover around the 
Owena River basin was lost. For the period 1982–2003, Le et al. 
(2012) found that 8% of the Volta River basin’s landmass had been 
degraded, with this increasing to 65% after accounting for the effects 
of CO2 (and NOx) fertilisation.
Greening has also been observed in parts of southern Africa but 
it is relatively weak compared to other regions of the continent 
(Helldén and Tottrup 2008; Fensholt et al. 2012). However, greening 
can be accompanied by desertification when factors such as 
decreasing species richness, changes in species composition and 
shrub encroachment are observed (Smith et al. 2013; Herrmann and 
Tappan 2013; Kaptué et al. 2015; Herrmann and Sop 2016; Saha 
et al. 2015) (Sections 3.1.4 and 3.7.3). In the Okavango river Basin 
in southern Africa, conversion of land towards higher utilisation 
intensities, unsustainable agricultural practises and overexploitation 
of the savanna ecosystems have been observed in recent decades 
(Weinzierl et al. 2016).
In the arid Algerian High Plateaus, desertification due to both climatic 
and human causes led to the loss of indigenous plant biodiversity 
between 1975 and 2006 (Hirche et al. 2011). Ayoub (1998) identified 
64 Mha in Sudan as degraded, with the Central North Kordofan 
state being most affected. However, reforestation measures in the 
last decade sustained by improved rainfall conditions have led to 
low-medium regrowth conditions in about 20% of the area (Dawelbait 
and Morari 2012). In Morocco, areas affected by desertification were 
predominantly on plains with high population and livestock pressure 
(del Barrio et al. 2016; Kouba et al. 2018; Lahlaoi et al. 2017). The 
annual costs of soil degradation were estimated at about 1% of Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) in Algeria and Egypt, and about 0.5% in 
Morocco and Tunisia (Réquier-Desjardins and Bied-Charreton 2006).
Asia
Prăvălie (2016) found that desertification is currently affecting 38 
of 48 countries in Asia. The changes in drylands in Asia over the 
period 1982–2011 were mixed, with some areas experiencing 
vegetation improvement while others showed reduced vegetation 
(Miao  et al. 2015a). Major river basins undergoing salinisation 
include: Indo-Gangetic Basin in India (Lal and Stewart 2012), Indus 
Basin in Pakistan (Aslam and Prathapar 2006), Yellow River Basin 
in China (Chengrui and Dregne 2001), Yinchuan Plain in China 
(Zhou et al. 2013), Aral Sea Basin of Central Asia (Cai et al. 2003; 
Pankova 2016; Qadir et al. 2009).
Helldén and Tottrup (2008) highlighted a  greening trend in East 
Asia between 1982 and 2003. Over the past several decades, air 
temperature and the rainfall increased in the arid and hyper-arid 
region of Northwest China (Chen et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2017). 
Within China, rainfall erosivity has shown a  positive trend in 
dryland areas between 1961 and 2012 (Yang and Lu 2015). While 
water erosion area in Xinjiang, China, has decreased by 23.2%, 
erosion considered as severe or intense was still increasing (Zhang 
et al. 2015). Xue et al. (2017) used remote sensing data covering 
1975 to 2015 to show that wind-driven desertified land in northern 
Shanxi in China had expanded until 2000, before contracting again. 
Li et al. (2012) used satellite data to identify desertification in Inner 
Mongolia, China and found a link between policy changes and the 
locations and extent of human-caused desertification. Several oasis 
regions in China have seen increases in cropland area, while forests, 
grasslands and available water resources have decreased (Fu et al. 
2017; Muyibul et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2014). Between 1990 and 2011 
15.3% of Hogno Khaan nature reserve in central Mongolia was 
subjected to desertification (Lamchin et al. 2016). Using satellite data 
Liu et al. (2013) found the area of Mongolia undergoing non-climatic

desertification was associated with increases in goat density and 
wildfire occurrence.
In Central Asia, drying up of the Aral Sea is continuing to have negative 
impacts on regional microclimate and human health (Issanova and 
Abuduwaili 2017; Lioubimtseva 2015; Micklin 2016; Xi and Sokolik 
2015). Half of the region’s irrigated lands, especially in the Amudarya 
and Syrdarya river basins, were affected by secondary salinisation 
(Qadir et al. 2009). Le et al. (2016) showed that about 57% of 
croplands in Kazakhstan and about 20% of croplands in Kyrgyzstan 
had reductions in their vegetation productivity between 1982 and 
2006. Chen et al. (2019) indicated that about 58% of the grasslands 
in the region had reductions in their vegetation productivity between 
1999 and 2015. Anthropogenic factors were the main driver of this 
loss in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, while the role of human drivers 
was smaller than that of climate-related factors in Tajikistan and 
Kyrgyzstan (Chen et al. 2019). The total costs of land degradation in 
Central Asia were estimated to equal about 6 billion USD annually 
(Mirzabaev et al. 2016).
Damberg and AghaKouchak (2014) found that parts of South Asia 
experienced drying over the last three decades. More than 75% of 
the area of northern, western and southern Afghanistan is affected 
by overgrazing and deforestation (UNEP-GEF 2008). Desertification is 
a serious problem in Pakistan with a wide range of human and natural 
causes (Irshad et al. 2007; Lal 2018). Similarly, desertification affects 
parts of India (Kundu et al. 2017; Dharumarajan et al. 2018; Christian 
et al. 2018). Using satellite data to map various desertification 
processes, Ajai et al. (2009) found that 81.4 Mha were subject to 
various processes of desertification in India in 2005, while salinisation 
affected 6.73 Mha in the country (Singh 2009). 
Saudi Arabia is highly vulnerable to desertification (Ministry of 
Energy Industry and Mineral Resources 2016), with this vulnerability 
expected to increase in the north-western parts of the country in the 
coming decades. Yahiya (2012) found that Jazan, south-western Saudi 
Arabia, lost about 46% of its vegetation cover from 1987 to 2002. 
Droughts and frequent dust storms were shown to impose adverse 
impacts over Saudi Arabia, especially under global warming and 
future climate change (Hasanean et al. 2015). In north-west Jordan, 
18% of the area was prone to severe to very severe desertification 
(Al-Bakri et al. 2016). Large parts of the Syrian drylands have been 
identified as undergoing desertification (Evans and Geerken 2004; 
Geerken and Ilaiwi 2004). Moridnejad et al. (2015) identified newly 
desertified regions in the Middle East based on dust sources, finding 
that these regions accounted for 39% of all detected dust source 
points. Desertification has increased substantially in Iran since the 
1930s. Despite numerous efforts to rehabilitate degraded areas, it 
still poses a major threat to agricultural livelihoods in the country 
(Amiraslani and Dragovich 2011). 
Australia
Damberg and AghaKouchak (2014) found that wetter conditions 
were experienced in northern Australia over the last three decades 
with widespread greening observed between 1981 and 2006 over 
much of Australia, except for eastern Australia where large areas 
were affected by droughts from 2002 to 2009 based on Advanced 
High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data (Donohue et al. 
2009). For the period 1982–2013, Burrell et al. (2017) also found 
widespread greening over Australia including eastern Australia 
over the post-drought period. This dramatic change in the trend 
found for eastern Australia emphasises the dominant role played 
by precipitation in the drylands. Degradation due to anthropogenic 
activities and other causes affects over 5% of Australia, particularly 
near the central west coast. Jackson and Prince (2016) used a local 
NPP scaling approach applied with MODIS derived vegetation data 
to quantify degradation in a dryland watershed in Northern Australia 
from 2000 to 2013. They estimated that 20% of the watershed was 
degraded. Salinisation has also been found to be degrading parts of 
the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia (Rengasamy 2006). Eldridge and 
Soliveres (2014) examined areas undergoing woody encroachment in 
eastern Australia and found that rather than degrading the landscape, 
the shrubs often enhanced ecosystem services. 
Europe 
Drylands cover 33.8% of northern Mediterranean countries: 
approximately 69% of Spain, 66% of Cyprus, and between 16% and 
62% in Greece, Portugal, Italy and France (Zdruli 2011). The European 
Environment Agency (EEA) indicated that 14 Mha, that is 8% of the 
territory of the European Union (mostly in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, 
Italy, Romania, Spain and Portugal), had a  ‘very high’ and ‘high 
sensitivity’ to desertification (European Court of Auditors 2018). This 
figure increases to 40 Mha (23% of the EU territory) if ‘moderately’ 
sensitive areas are included (Prăvălie et al. 2017; European Court of 
Auditors 2018). Desertification in the region is driven by irrigation 
developments and encroachment of cultivation on rangelands 
(Safriel 2009) caused by population growth, agricultural policies, and 
markets. According to a recent assessment report (ECA 2018), Europe 
is increasingly affected by desertification leading to significant 
consequences on land use, particularly in Portugal, Spain, Italy, 
Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. Using the Universal 
Soil Loss Equation, it was estimated that soil erosion can be as high 
as 300 t ha–1 yr–1 (equivalent to a net loss of 18 mm yr–1) in Spain 
(López-Bermúdez 1990). For the badlands region in south-east Spain, 
however, it was shown that biological soil crusts effectively prevent 
soil erosion (Lázaro et al. 2008). In Mediterranean Europe, Guerra 
et al. (2016) found a reduction of erosion due to greater effectiveness 
of soil erosion prevention between 2001 and 2013. Helldén and 
Tottrup (2008) observed a  greening trend in the Mediterranean 
between 1982 and 2003, while Fensholt et al. (2012) also show 
a dominance of greening in Eastern Europe. 
In Russia, at the beginning of the 2000s, about 7% of the total area 
(that is, approximately 130 Mha) was threatened by desertification 
(Gunin and Pankova 2004; Kust et al. 2011). Turkey is considered 
highly vulnerable to drought, land degradation and desertification 
(Türkeş 1999, 2003). About 60% of Turkey’s land area is characterised 
with hydro-climatological conditions favourable for desertification 
(Türkeş 2013). ÇEMGM (2017) estimated that about half of Turkey’s 
land area (48.6%) is prone to moderate-to-high desertification.

North America
Drylands cover approximately 60% of Mexico. According to Pontifes 
et al. (2018), 3.5% of the area was converted from natural vegetation 
to agriculture and human settlements between 2002 and 2011. 
The region is highly vulnerable to desertification due to frequent 
droughts and floods (Méndez and Magaña 2010; Stahle et al. 2009; 
Becerril-Pina Rocio et al. 2015).
For the period 2000–2011 the overall difference between 
potential and actual NPP in different land capability classes in the 
south-western United States was 11.8% (Noojipady et al. 2015); 
reductions in grassland-savannah and livestock grazing area and 
forests were the highest. Bush encroachment is observed over a fairly 
wide area of grasslands in the western United States, including 
Jornada Basin within the Chihuahuan Desert, and is spreading at 
a fast rate despite grazing restrictions intended to curb the spread 
(Yanoff and Muldavin 2008; Browning and Archer 2011; Van Auken 
2009; Rachal et al. 2012). In comparing sand dune migration patterns 
and rates between 1995 and 2014, Potter and Weigand (2016) 
established that the area covered by stable dune surfaces, and sand 
removal zones, decreased, while sand accumulation zones increased 
from 15.4 to 25.5 km2 for Palen Dunes in the Southern California 
desert, while movement of Kelso Dunes is less clear (Lam et al. 2011). 
Within the United States, average soil erosion rates on all croplands 
decreased by about 38% between 1982 and 2003 due to better soil 
management practices (Kertis 2003). 
Central and South America
Morales et al. (2011) indicated that desertification costs between 8% 
and 14% of gross agricultural product in many Central and South 
American countries. Parts of the dry Chaco and Caldenal regions in 
Argentina have undergone widespread degradation over the last 
century (Verón et al. 2017; Fernández et al. 2009). Bisigato and 
Laphitz (2009) identified overgrazing as a cause of desertification 
in the Patagonian Monte region of Argentina. Vieira et al. (2015) 
found that 94% of northeast Brazilian drylands were susceptible 
to desertification. It is estimated that up to 50% of the area was 
being degraded due to frequent prolonged droughts and clearing of 
forests for agriculture. This land-use change threatens the extinction 
of around 28 native species (Leal et al. 2005). In Central Chile, 
dryland forest and shrubland area was reduced by 1.7% and 0.7%, 
respectively, between 1975 and 2008 (Schulz et al. 2010).
1.2.2 
Attribution of desertification
Desertification is a  result of complex interactions within coupled 
social-ecological systems. Thus, the relative contributions of 
climatic, anthropogenic and other drivers of desertification vary 
depending on specific socio-economic and ecological contexts. The 
high natural climate variability in dryland regions is a major cause 
of vegetation changes but does not necessarily imply degradation. 
Drought is not degradation as the land productivity may return 
entirely once the drought ends (Kassas 1995). However, if droughts 
increase in frequency, intensity and/or duration they may overwhelm 
the vegetation’s ability to recover (ecosystem resilience, Prince 
et al. 2018), causing degradation. Assuming a  stationary climate 
and no human influence, rainfall variability results in fluctuations 
in vegetation dynamics which can be considered temporary, as the 
ecosystem tends to recover with rainfall, and desertification does 
not occur (Ellis 1995; Vetter 2005; von Wehrden et al. 2012). Climate 
change on the other hand, exemplified by a non-stationary climate, 
can gradually cause a persistent change in the ecosystem through 
aridification and CO2 changes. Assuming no human influence, this 
‘natural’ climatic version of desertification may take place rapidly, 
especially when thresholds are reached (Prince et al. 2018), or over 
longer periods of time as the ecosystems slowly adjust to a  new 
climatic norm through progressive changes in the plant community 
composition. Accounting for this climatic variability is required before 
attributions to other causes of desertification can be made. 
For attributing vegetation changes to climate versus other causes, 
rain use efficiency (RUE  – the change in net primary productivity 
(NPP) per unit of precipitation) and its variations in time have 
been used (Prince et al. 1998). Global applications of RUE trends 
to attribute degradation to climate or other (largely human) causes 
have been performed by Bai et al. (2008) and Le et al. (2016) 
(Section  3.2.1.1). The RESTREND (residual trend) method analyses 
the correlation between annual maximum NDVI (or other vegetation 
index as a proxy for NPP) and precipitation by testing accumulation 
and lag periods for the precipitation (Evans and Geerken 2004). The 
identified relationship with the highest correlation represents the 
maximum amount of vegetation variability that can be explained by 
the precipitation, and corresponding RUE values can be calculated. 
Using this relationship, the climate component of the NDVI time 
series can be reconstructed, and the difference between this and the 
original time series (the residual) is attributed to anthropogenic and 
other causes. 
The RESTREND method, or minor variations of it, have been applied 
extensively. Herrmann and Hutchinson (2005) concluded that 
climate was the dominant causative factor for widespread greening 
in the Sahel region from 1982–2003, and anthropogenic and other 
factors were mostly producing land improvements or no change. 
However, pockets of desertification were identified in Nigeria and 
Sudan. Similar results were also found from 1982–2007 by Huber 
et al. (2011). Wessels et al. (2007) applied RESTREND to South 
Africa and showed that RESTREND produced a  more accurate 
identification of degraded land than RUE alone. RESTREND identified 
a smaller area undergoing desertification due to non-climate causes 
compared to the NDVI trends. Liu et al. (2013) extended the climate 
component of RESTREND to include temperature and applied this 
to VOD observations of the cold drylands of Mongolia. They found 
the area undergoing desertification due to non-climatic causes is 
much smaller than the area with negative VOD trends. RESTREND 
has also been applied in several other studies to the Sahel (Leroux 
et al. 2017), Somalia (Omuto et al. 2010), West Africa (Ibrahim et al. 
2015), China (Li et al. 2012; Yin et al. 2014), Central Asia (Jiang et al. 
2017), Australia (Burrell et al. 2017) and globally (Andela et al. 2013). 
In each of these studies the extent to which desertification can be 
attributed to climate versus other causes varies across the landscape.

These studies represent the best regional, remote-sensing based 
attribution studies to date, noting that RESTREND and RUE have 
some limitations (Higginbottom and Symeonakis 2014). Vegetation 
growth (NPP) changes slowly compared to rainfall variations and 
may be sensitive to rainfall over extended periods (years), depending 
on vegetation type. Detection of lags and the use of weighted 
antecedent rainfall can partially address this problem, though most 
studies do not do this. The method addresses changes since the 
start of the time series; it cannot identify whether an area is already 
degraded at the start time. It is assumed that climate, particularly 
rainfall, is a principal factor in vegetation change which may not be 
true in more humid regions.
Another assumption in RESTREND is that any trend is linear 
throughout the period examined. That is, there are no discontinuities 
(break points) in the trend. Browning et al. (2017) have shown 
that break points in NDVI time series reflect vegetation changes 
based on long-term field sites. To overcome this limitation, Burrell 
et al. (2017) introduced the Time Series Segmentation-RESTREND 
(TSS-RESTREND) which allows a breakpoint or turning point within 
the period examined (Figure 3.7). Using TSS-RESTREND over Australia 
they identified more than double the degrading area than could be 
identified with a standard RESTREND analysis. The occurrence and 
drivers of abrupt change (turning points) in ecosystem functioning 
were also examined by Horion et al. (2016) over the semi-arid 
Northern Eurasian agricultural frontier. They combined trend shifts 
in RUE, field data and expert knowledge,  to map environmental 
hotspots of change and attribute them to climate and human 
activities. One-third of the area showed significant change in RUE, 
mainly occurring around the fall of the Soviet Union (1991) or as 
the result of major droughts. Recent human-induced turning points 
in ecosystem functioning were uncovered around Volgograd (Russia) 
and around Lake Balkhash (Kazakhstan), attributed to recultivation, 
increased salinisation, and increased grazing.
Attribution of vegetation changes to human activity has also been 
done within modelling frameworks. In these methods ecosystem 
models are used to simulate potential natural vegetation dynamics, 
and this is compared to the observed state. The difference is attributed 
to human activities. Applied to the Sahel region during the period 
of 1982–2002, it showed that people had a  minor influence on 
vegetation changes (Seaquist et al. 2009). Similar model/observation 
comparisons performed globally found that CO2 fertilisation was the 
strongest forcing at global scales, with climate having regionally 
varying effects (Mao et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2016). Land-use/
land-cover change was a dominant forcing in localised areas. The use 
of this method to examine vegetation changes in China (1982–2009) 
attributed most of the greening trend to CO2 fertilisation and 
nitrogen (N) deposition (Piao et al. 2015). However in some parts of 
northern and western China, which includes large areas of drylands, 
Piao et al. (2015) found climate changes could be the dominant forcing. 
In the northern extratropical land surface, the observed greening was 
consistent with increases in greenhouse gases (notably CO2) and the 
related climate change, and not consistent with a natural climate 
that does not include anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases 
(Mao et al. 2016). While many studies found widespread influence 
of CO2 fertilisation, it is not ubiquitous; for example, Lévesque et al. 
(2014) found little response to CO2 fertilisation in some tree species 
in Switzerland/northern Italy.
Using multiple extreme-event attribution methodologies, Uhe et al. 
(2018) shows that the dominant influence for droughts in eastern 
Africa during the October–December ‘short rains’ season is the 
prevailing tropical SST patterns, although temperature trends mean 
that the current drought conditions are hotter than they would have 
been without climate change. Similarly, Funk et al. (2019) found that 
2017 March–June East African drought was influenced by Western 
Pacific SST, with high SST conditions attributed to climate change.
There are numerous local case studies on attribution of 
desertification, which use different periods, focus on different land 
uses and covers, and consider different desertification processes. For 
example, two-thirds of the observed expansion of the Sahara Desert 
from 1920–2003 has been attributed to natural climate cycles (the 
cold phase of Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation and Pacific Decadal 
Oscillation) (Thomas and Nigam 2018). Some studies consider 
drought to be the main driver of desertification in Africa (e.g., Masih 
et al. 2014). However, other studies suggest that although droughts 
may contribute to desertification, the underlying causes are human 
activities (Kouba et al. 2018). Brandt et al. (2016a) found that woody 
vegetation trends are negatively correlated with human population 
density. Changes in land use, water pumping and flow diversion have 
enhanced drying of wetlands and salinisation of freshwater aquifers 
in Israel (Inbar 2007). The dryland territory of China has been found to 
be very sensitive to both climatic variations and land-use/land-cover 
changes (Fu et al. 2000; Liu and Tian 2010; Zhao et al. 2013, 2006). 
Feng et al. (2015) shows that socio-economic factors were dominant 
in causing desertification in north Shanxi, China, between 1983 
and 2012, accounting for about 80% of desertification expansion. 
Successful grass establishment has been impeded by overgrazing 
and nutrient depletion leading to the encroachment of shrubs into 
the northern Chihuahuan Desert (USA) since the mid-19th century 
(Kidron and Gutschick 2017). Human activities led to rangeland 
degradation in Pakistan and Mongolia during 2000–2011 (Lei et al. 
2011). More equal shares of climatic (temperature and precipitation 
trends) and human factors were attributed for changes in rangeland 
condition in China (Yang et al. 2016).
This kaleidoscope of local case studies demonstrates how attribution 
of desertification is still challenging for several reasons. Firstly, 
desertification is caused by an interaction of different drivers which 
vary in space and time. Secondly, in drylands, vegetation reacts closely 
to changes in rainfall so the effect of rainfall changes on biomass needs 
to be ‘removed’ before attributing desertification to human activities. 
Thirdly, human activities and climatic drivers impact vegetation/
ecosystem changes at different rates. Finally, desertification manifests 
as a  gradual change in ecosystem composition and structure 
(e.g., woody shrub invasion into grasslands). Although initiated at 
a limited location, ecosystem change may propagate throughout an 
extensive area via a series of feedback mechanisms. This complicates 
the attribution of desertification to human and climatic causes, as the 
process can develop independently once started.

Rasmussen et al. (2016) studied the reasons behind the overall lack 
of scientific agreement in trends of environmental changes in the 
Sahel, including their causes. The study indicated that these are due 
to differences in conceptualisations and choice of indicators, biases 
in study site selection, differences in methods, varying measurement 
accuracy, differences in time and spatial scales. High-resolution, 
multi-sensor airborne platforms provide a way to address some of 
these issues (Asner et al. 2012).
The major conclusion of this section is that, with all the shortcomings 
of individual case studies, relative roles of climatic and human drivers 
of desertification are location-specific and evolve over time (high 
confidence). Biophysical research on attribution and socio-economic 
research on drivers of land degradation have long studied the 
same topic, but in parallel, with little interdisciplinary integration. 
Interdisciplinary work to identify typical patterns, or typologies, of 
such interactions of biophysical and human drivers of desertification 
(not only of dryland vulnerability), and their relative shares, done 
globally in comparable ways, will help in the formulation of better 
informed policies to address desertification and achieve land 
degradation neutrality. 
1.3 
Desertification feedbacks to climate
While climate change can drive desertification (Section 3.1.4.1), the 
process of desertification can also alter the local climate, providing 
a feedback (Sivakumar 2007). These feedbacks can alter the carbon 
cycle, and hence the level of atmospheric CO2 and its related global 
climate change, or they can alter the surface energy and water 
budgets, directly impacting the local climate. While these feedbacks 
occur in all climate zones (Chapter 2), here we focus on their effects 
in dryland regions and assess the literature concerning the major 
desertification feedbacks to climate. The main feedback pathways 
discussed throughout Section 3.3 are summarised in Figure 3.8.
Drylands are characterised by limited soil moisture compared 
to humid regions. Thus, the sensible heat (heat that causes the 
atmospheric temperature to rise) accounts for more of the surface net 
radiation than latent heat (evaporation) in these regions (Wang and 
Dickinson 2013). This tight coupling between the surface energy 
balance and the soil moisture in semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones 
makes these regions susceptible to land–atmosphere feedback loops 
that can amplify changes to the water cycle (Seneviratne et al. 2010). 
Changes to the land surface caused by desertification can change 
the surface energy budget, altering the soil moisture and triggering 
these feedbacks.
1.3.1 
Sand and dust aerosols
Sand and mineral dust are frequently mobilised from sparsely 
vegetated drylands forming ‘sand storms’ or ‘dust storms’ 
(UNEP  et al. 2016). The African continent is the most important 
source of desert dust; perhaps 50% of atmospheric dust comes from 
the Sahara (Middleton 2017). Ginoux et al. (2012) estimated that 
25% of global dust emissions have anthropogenic origins, often in 
drylands. These events can play an important role in the local energy 
balance. Through reducing vegetation cover and drying the surface 
conditions, desertification can increase the frequency of these events. 
Biological or structural soil crusts have been shown to effectively 
stabilise dryland soils. Thus their loss due to intense land use and/
or climate change can be expected to cause an increase in sand and 
dust storms (high confidence) (Rajot et al. 2003; Field et al. 2010; 
Rodriguez-Caballero et al. 2018). These sand and dust aerosols 
impact the regional climate in several ways (Choobari et al. 2014). 
The direct effect is the interception, reflection and absorption of solar 
radiation in the atmosphere, reducing the energy available at the land 
surface and increasing the temperature of the atmosphere in layers 
with sand and dust present (Kaufman et al. 2002; Middleton 2017; 
Kok et al. 2018). The heating of the dust layer can alter the relative 
humidity and atmospheric stability, which can change cloud lifetimes 
and water content. This has been referred to as the semi-direct 
effect (Huang et al. 2017). Aerosols also have an indirect effect on 
climate through their role as cloud condensation nuclei, changing 
cloud radiative properties as well as the evolution and development 
of precipitation (Kaufman et al. 2002). While these indirect effects 
are more variable than the direct effects, depending on the types 
and amounts of aerosols present, the general tendency is toward an 
increase in the number, but a reduction in the size of cloud droplets, 
increasing the cloud reflectivity and decreasing the chances of 
precipitation. These effects are referred to as aerosol-radiation and 
aerosol–cloud interactions (Boucher et al. 2013).
There is high confidence that there is a  negative relationship 
between vegetation green-up and the occurrence of dust storms 
(Engelstaedter et al. 2003; Fan et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2015; Zou and 
Zhai 2004). Changes in groundwater can affect vegetation and the 
generation of atmospheric dust (Elmore et al. 2008). This can occur 
through groundwater processes such as the vertical movement of 
salt to the surface causing salinisation, supply of near-surface soil 
moisture, and sustenance of groundwater dependent vegetation. 
Groundwater dependent ecosystems have been identified in many 
dryland regions around the world (Decker et al. 2013; Lamontagne 
et al. 2005; Patten et al. 2008). In these locations declining 
groundwater levels can decrease vegetation cover. Cook et al. (2009) 
found that dust aerosols intensified the ‘Dust Bowl’ drought in North 
America during the 1930s.
By decreasing the amount of green cover and hence increasing the 
occurrence of sand and dust storms, desertification will increase 
the amount of shortwave cooling associated with the direct effect 
(high confidence). There is medium confidence that the semi-direct 
and indirect effects of this dust would tend to decrease precipitation 
and hence provide a positive feedback to desertification (Huang et al. 
2009; Konare et al. 2008; Rosenfeld et al. 2001; Solmon et al. 2012; 
Zhao et al. 2015). However, the combined effect of dust has also been 
found to increase precipitation in some areas (Islam and Almazroui 
2012; Lau et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2012). The overall combined effect 
of dust aerosols on desertification remains uncertain with low 
agreement between studies that find positive (Huang et al. 2014), 
negative (Miller et al. 2004) or no feedback on desertification 
(Zhao et al. 2015).

1.3.1.1 
Off-site feedbacks
Aerosols can act as a vehicle for the long-range transport of nutrients 
to oceans (Jickells et al. 2005; Okin et al. 2011) and terrestrial land 
surfaces (Das et al. 2013). In several locations, notably the Atlantic 
Ocean, the west of northern Africa, and the Pacific Ocean east of 
northern China, a  considerable amount of mineral dust aerosols, 
sourced from nearby drylands, reaches the oceans. It was estimated 
that 60% of dust transported off Africa is deposited in the Atlantic 
Ocean (Kaufman et al. 2005), while 50% of the dust generated in 
Asia reaches the Pacific Ocean or further (Uno et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 
1997). The Sahara is also a major source of dust for the Mediterranean 
basin (Varga et al. 2014). The direct effect of atmospheric dust over 
the ocean was found to be a cooling of the ocean surface (limited 
evidence, high agreement) (Evan and Mukhopadhyay 2010; 
Evan et al. 2009) with the tropical North Atlantic mixed layer cooling 
by over 1°C (Evan et al. 2009).
It has been suggested that dust may act as a source of nutrients for 
the upper ocean biota, enhancing the biological activity and related 
carbon sink (medium evidence, low agreement) (Lenes et al. 2001; 
Shaw et al. 2008; Neuer et al. 2004). The overall response depends on 
the environmental controls on the ocean biota, the type of aerosols 
including their chemical constituents, and the chemical environment 
in which they dissolve (Boyd et al. 2010).
Dust deposited on snow can increase the amount of absorbed 
solar radiation leading to more rapid melting (Painter et al. 2018), 
impacting a  region’s hydrological cycle (high confidence). Dust 
deposition on snow and ice has been found in many regions of the 
globe (e.g., Painter et al. 2018; Kaspari et al. 2014; Qian et al. 2015; 
Painter et al. 2013), however quantification of the effect globally 
and estimation of future changes in the extent of this effect remain 
knowledge gaps.
1.3.2 
Changes in surface albedo
Increasing surface albedo in dryland regions will impact the local 
climate, decreasing surface temperature and precipitation, and 
provide a positive feedback on the albedo (high confidence) (Charney 
et al. 1975). This albedo feedback can occur in desert regions 
worldwide (Zeng and Yoon 2009). Similar albedo feedbacks have 
also been found in regional studies over the Middle East (Zaitchik 
et al. 2007), Australia (Evans et al. 2017; Meng et al. 2014a, b), South 
America (Lee and Berbery 2012) and the USA (Zaitchik et al. 2013).

Recent work has also found albedo in dryland regions can be 
associated with soil surface communities of lichens, mosses and 
cyanobacteria (Rodriguez-Caballero et al. 2018). These communities 
compose the soil crust in these ecosystems and due to the sparse 
vegetation cover, directly influence the albedo. These communities 
are sensitive to climate changes, with field experiments indicating 
albedo changes greater than 30% are possible. Thus, changes in 
these communities could trigger surface albedo feedback processes 
(limited evidence, high agreement) (Rutherford et al. 2017).
A further pertinent feedback relationship exists between changes 
in land-cover, albedo, carbon stocks and associated GHG emissions, 
particularly in drylands with low levels of cloud cover. One of the 
first studies to focus on the subject was Rotenberg and Yakir (2010), 
who used the concept of ‘radiative forcing’ to compare the relative 
climatic effect of a change in albedo with a change in atmospheric 
GHGs due to the presence of forest within drylands. Based on this 
analysis, it was estimated that the change in surface albedo due to 
the degradation of semi-arid areas has decreased radiative forcing in 
these areas by an amount equivalent to approximately 20% of global 
anthropogenic GHG emissions between 1970 and 2005.
1.3.3 
Changes in vegetation and greenhouse  
gas fluxes
Terrestrial ecosystems have the ability to alter atmospheric GHGs 
through a number of processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This may be 
through a change in plant and soil carbon stocks, either sequestering 
atmospheric CO2 during growth or releasing carbon during combustion 
and respiration, or through processes such as enteric fermentation of 
domestic and wild ruminants that leads to the release of methane and 
nitrous oxide (Sivakumar 2007). It is estimated that 241–470 GtC is 
stored in dryland soils (top 1 m) (Lal 2004; Plaza et al. 2018). When 
evaluating the effect of desertification, the net balance of all the 
processes and associated GHG fluxes needs to be considered. 
Desertification usually leads to a loss in productivity and a decline 
in above – and below-ground carbon stocks (Abril et al. 2005; Asner 
et al. 2003). Drivers such as overgrazing lead to a decrease in both 
plant and SOC pools (Abdalla et al. 2018). While dryland ecosystems 
are often characterised by open vegetation, not all drylands have low 
biomass and carbon stocks in an intact state (Lechmere-Oertel et al. 
2005; Maestre et al. 2012). Vegetation types such as the subtropical 
thicket of South Africa have over 70 tC ha–1 in an intact state, 
greater than 60% of which is released into the atmosphere during 
degradation through overgrazing (Lechmere-Oertel et al. 2005; 
Powell 2009). In comparison, semi-arid grasslands and savannahs 
with similar rainfall, may have only 5–35 tC ha–1 (Scholes and Walker 
1993; Woomer et al. 2004).
At the same time, it is expected that a decline in plant productivity may 
lead to a decrease in fuel loads and a reduction in CO2, nitrous oxide 
and methane emissions from fire. In a  similar manner, decreasing 
productivity may lead to a  reduction in numbers of ruminant 
animals that in turn would decrease methane emissions. Few studies 
have focussed on changes in these sources of emissions due to 
desertification and it remains a field that requires further research. 
In comparison to desertification through the suppression of primary 
production, the process of woody plant encroachment can result in 
significantly different climatic feedbacks. Increasing woody plant 
cover in open rangeland ecosystems leads to an increase in woody 
carbon stocks both above – and below-ground (Asner et al. 2003; 
Hughes et al. 2006; Petrie et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016). Within the 
drylands of Texas, USA, shrub encroachment led to a 32% increase 
in aboveground carbon stocks over a period of 69 years (3.8 tC ha–1 
to 5.0 tC ha–1) (Asner et al. 2003). Encroachment by taller woody 
species can lead to significantly higher observed biomass and carbon 
stocks. For example, encroachment by Dichrostachys cinerea and 
several Vachellia species in the sub-humid savannahs of north-west 
South Africa led to an increase of 31–46 tC ha–1 over a  50–65 
year period (1936–2001) (Hudak et al. 2003). In terms of potential 
changes in SOC stocks, the effect may be dependent on annual 
rainfall and soil type. Woody cover generally leads to an increase in 
SOC stocks in drylands that have less than 800 mm of annual rainfall, 
while encroachment can lead to a loss of soil carbon in more humid 
ecosystems (Barger et al. 2011; Jackson et al. 2002).
The suppression of the grass layer through the process of woody 
encroachment may lead to a  decrease in carbon stocks within 
this relatively small carbon pool (Magandana 2016). Conversely, 
increasing woody cover may lead to a decrease and even halt in 
surface fires and associated GHG emissions. In their analysis of drivers 
of fire in southern Africa, Archibald et al. (2009) note that there is 
a potential threshold around 40% canopy cover, above which surface 
grass fires are rare. Whilst there have been a number of studies on 
changes in carbon stocks due to desertification in North America, 
southern Africa and Australia, a global assessment of the net change 
in carbon stocks – as well as fire and ruminant GHG emissions due to 
woody plant encroachment – has not been done yet.

Desertification impacts on natural  
and socio-economic systems under 
climate change 
1.4.1 
Impacts on natural and managed ecosystems 
1.4.1.1 
Impacts on ecosystems and their services in drylands
The Millenium Ecosystem Assessement (2005) proposed four 
classes of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating, supporting 
and cultural services (Cross-Chapter Box  8  in Chapter  6). These 
ecosystem services in drylands are vulnerable to the impacts of 
climate change due to high variability in temperature, precipitation 
and soil fertility (Enfors and Gordon 2008; Mortimore 2005). There is 
high confidence that desertification processes such as soil erosion, 
secondary salinisation, and overgrazing have negatively impacted 
provisioning ecosystem services in drylands, particularly food and 
fodder production (Majeed and Muhammad 2019; Mirzabaev et al. 
2016; Qadir et al. 2009; Van Loo et al. 2017; Tokbergenova et al. 2018) 
(Section 3.4.2.2). Zika and Erb (2009) reported an estimation of NPP

losses between 0.8 and 2.0 GtC yr–1 due to desertification, comparing 
the potential NPP and the NPP calculated for the year 2000. In terms 
of climatic factors, although climatic changes between 1976 and 
2016 were found to be favourable for crop yields overall in Russia 
(Ivanov et al. 2018), yield decreases of up to 40–60% in dryland areas 
were caused by severe and extensive droughts (Ivanov et al. 2018). 
Increase in temperature can have a direct impact on animals in the 
form of increased physiological stress (Rojas-Downing et al. 2017), 
increased water requirements for drinking and cooling, a decrease 
in the production of milk, meat and eggs, increased stress during 
conception and reproduction (Nardone et al. 2010) or an increase in 
seasonal diseases and epidemics (Thornton et al. 2009; Nardone et al. 
2010). Furthermore, changes in temperature can indirectly impact 
livestock through reducing the productivity and quality of feed crops 
and forages (Thornton et al. 2009; Polley et al. 2013). On the other 
hand, fewer days with extreme cold temperatures during winter in 
the temperate zones are associated with lower livestock mortality. 
The future projection of impacts on ecosystems is presented in 
Section 3.5.2.
Over-extraction is leading to groundwater depletion in many dryland 
areas (high confidence) (Mudd 2000; Mays 2013; Mahmod and 
Watanabe 2014; Jolly et al. 2008). Globally, groundwater reserves 
have been reduced since 1900, with the highest rate of estimated 
reductions of 145 km3 yr–1 between 2000 and 2008 (Konikow 2011). 
Some arid lands are very vulnerable to groundwater reductions, 
because the current natural recharge rates are lower than during 
the previous wetter periods (e.g., the Atacama Desert, and Nubian 
aquifer system in Africa) (Squeo et al. 2006; Mahmod and Watanabe 
2014; Herrera et al. 2018). 
Among regulating services, desertification can influence levels of 
atmospheric CO2. In drylands, the majority of carbon is stored below 
ground in the form of biomass and SOC (FAO 1995) (Section 3.3.3). 
Land-use changes often lead to reductions in SOC and organic matter 
inputs into soil (Albaladejo et al. 2013; Almagro et al. 2010; Hoffmann 
et al. 2012; Lavee et al. 1998; Rey et al. 2011), increasing soil salinity 
and soil erosion (Lavee et al. 1998; Martinez-Mena et al. 2008). In 
addition to the loss of soil, erosion reduces soil nutrients and organic 
matter, thereby impacting land’s productive capacity. To illustrate, 
soil erosion by water is estimated to result in the loss of 23–42 Mt 
of nitrogen and 14.6–26.4 Mt of phosphorus from soils globally each 
year (Pierzynski et al. 2017).
Precipitation, by affecting soil moisture content, is considered to be 
the principal determinant of the capacity of drylands to sequester 
carbon (Fay et al. 2008; Hao et al. 2008; Mi et al. 2015; Serrano-Ortiz 
et al. 2015; Vargas et al. 2012; Sharkhuu et al. 2016). Lower annual 
rainfall resulted in the release of carbon into the atmosphere for 
a  number of sites located in Mongolia, China and North America 
(Biederman et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2009; Fay et al. 2008; Hao et al. 
2008; Mi et al. 2015; Sharkhuu et al. 2016). Low soil water availability 
promotes soil microbial respiration, yet there is insufficient moisture 
to stimulate plant productivity (Austin et al. 2004), resulting in net 
carbon emissions at an ecosystem level. Under even drier conditions, 
photodegradation of vegetation biomass may often constitute 
an additional loss of carbon from an ecosystem (Rutledge et al. 
2010). In contrast, years of good rainfall in drylands resulted in the 
sequestration of carbon (Biederman et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2009; 
Hao et al. 2008). In an exceptionally rainy year (2011) in the southern 
hemisphere, the semi-arid ecosystems of this region contributed 
51% of the global net carbon sink (Poulter et al. 2014). These results 
suggest that arid ecosystems could be an important global carbon 
sink, depending on soil water availability (medium evidence, high 
agreement). However, drylands are generally predicted to become 
warmer with an increasing frequency of extreme drought and high 
rainfall events (Donat et al. 2016).
When desertification reduces vegetation cover, this alters the soil 
surface, affecting the albedo and the water balance (Gonzalez-Martin 
et al. 2014) (Section 3.3). In such situations, erosive winds have no 
more obstacles, which favours the occurrence of wind erosion and 
dust storms. Mineral aerosols have an important influence on the 
dispersal of soil nutrients and lead to changes in soil characteristics 
(Goudie and Middleton 2001; Middleton 2017). Thereby, the soil 
formation as a supporting ecosystem service is negatively affected 
(Section  3.3.1). Soil erosion by wind results in a  loss of fine soil 
particles (silt and clay), reducing the ability of soil to sequester 
carbon (Wiesmeier et al. 2015). Moreover, dust storms reduce crop 
yields by loss of plant tissue caused by sandblasting (resulting in loss 
of plant leaves and hence reduced photosynthetic activity (Field et al. 
2010), exposing crop roots, crop seed burial under sand deposits, and 
leading to losses of nutrients and fertiliser from topsoil (Stefanski and 
Sivakumar 2009)). Dust storms also impact crop yields by reducing 
the quantity of water available for irrigation; they can decrease the 
storage capacity of reservoirs by siltation, and block conveyance 
canals (Middleton 2017; Middleton and Kang 2017; Stefanski and 
Sivakumar 2009). Livestock productivity is reduced by injuries caused 
by dust storms (Stefanski and Sivakumar 2009). Additionally, dust 
storms favour the dispersion of microbial and plant species, which 
can make local endemic species vulnerable to extinction and 
promote the invasion of plant and microbial species (Asem and Roy 
2010; Womack et al. 2010). Dust storms increase microbial species 
in remote sites (high confidence) (Kellogg et al. 2004; Prospero 
et al. 2005; Griffin et al. 2006; Schlesinger et al. 2006; Griffin 2007; 
De Deckker et al. 2008; Jeon et al. 2011; Abed et al. 2012; Favet et al. 
2013; Woo et al. 2013; Pointing and Belnap 2014). 
1.4.1.2 
Impacts on biodiversity: Plant and wildlife
Plant biodiversity 
Over 20% of global plant biodiversity centres are located within 
drylands (White and Nackoney 2003). Plant species located within 
these areas are characterised by high genetic diversity within 
populations (Martínez-Palacios et al. 1999). The plant species within 
these ecosystems are often highly threatened by climate change and 
desertification (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005b; Maestre 
et al. 2012). Increasing aridity exacerbates the risk of extinction of 
some plant species, especially those that are already threatened 
due to small populations or restricted habitats (Gitay et al. 2002). 
Desertification, including through land-use change, already 
contributed to the loss of biodiversity across drylands (medium 
confidence) (Newbold et al. 2015; Wilting et al. 2017). For example, 
272
Chapter 3 
Desertification

species richness decreased from 234 species in 1978 to 95 in 2011 
following long periods of drought and human driven degradation on 
the steppe land of south-western Algeria (Observatoire du Sahara 
et du Sahel 2013). Similarly, drought and overgrazing led to loss 
of biodiversity in Pakistan to the point that only drought-adapted 
species can now survive on the arid rangelands (Akhter and Arshad 
2006). Similar trends were observed in desert steppes of Mongolia 
(Khishigbayar et al. 2015). In contrast, the increase in annual 
moistening of southern European Russia from the late 1980s to 
the beginning of the 21st century caused the restoration of steppe 
vegetation, even under conditions of strong anthropogenic pressure 
(Ivanov et al. 2018). The seed banks of annual species can often 
survive over the long term, germinating in wet years, suggesting 
that these species could be resilient to some aspects of climate 
change (Vetter et al. 2005). Yet, Hiernaux and Houérou (2006) 
showed that overgrazing in the Sahel tended to decrease the seed 
bank of annuals, which could make them vulnerable to climate 
change over time. Perennial species, considered as the structuring 
element of the ecosystem, are usually less affected as they have 
deeper roots, xeromorphic properties and physiological mechanisms 
that increase drought tolerance (Le Houérou 1996). However, in 
North Africa, long-term monitoring (1978–2014) has shown that 
important plant perennial species have also disappeared due to 
drought (Stipa tenacissima and Artemisia herba alba) (Hirche et al. 
2018; Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel 2013). The aridisation of 
the climate in the south of Eastern Siberia led to the advance of the 
steppes to the north and to the corresponding migration of steppe 
mammal species between 1976 and 2016 (Ivanov et al. 2018). The 
future projection of impacts on plant biodiversity is presented in 
Section 3.5.2.
Wildlife biodiversity
Dryland ecosystems have high levels of faunal diversity and 
endemism (MEA 2005; Whitford 2002). Over 30% of the endemic 
bird areas are located within these regions, which is also home to 
25% of vertebrate species (Maestre et al. 2012; MEA 2005). Yet, 
many species within drylands are threatened with extinction (Durant 
et al. 2014; Walther 2016). Habitat degradation and desertification 
are generally associated with biodiversity loss (Ceballos et al. 
2010; Tang et al. 2018; Newbold et al. 2015). The ‘grazing value’ of 
land declines with both a reduction in vegetation cover and shrub 
encroachment, with the former being more detrimental to native 
vertebrates (Parsons et al. 2017). Conversely, shrub encroachment 
may buffer desertification by increasing resource and microclimate 
availability, resulting in an increase in vertebrate species abundance 
and richness observed in the shrub-encroached arid grasslands of 
North America (Whitford 1997) and Australia (Parsons et al. 2017). 
However, compared to historically resilient drylands, these encroached 
habitats and their new species assemblages may be more sensitive 
to droughts, which may become more prevalent with climate change 
(Schooley et al. 2018). Mammals and birds may be particularly 
sensitive to droughts because they rely on evaporative cooling to 
maintain their body temperatures within an optimal range (Hetem 
et al. 2016) and risk lethal dehydration in water limited environments 
(Albright et al. 2017). The direct effects of reduced rainfall and 
water availability are likely to be exacerbated by the indirect effects 
of desertification through a  reduction in primary productivity. 
A  reduction in the quality and quantity of resources available to 
herbivores due to desertification under changing climate can have 
knock-on consequences for predators and may ultimately disrupt 
trophic cascades (limited evidence, low agreement) (Rey et al. 2017; 
Walther 2010). Reduced resource availability may also compromise 
immune response to novel pathogens, with increased pathogen 
dispersal associated with dust storms (Zinabu et al. 2018). Responses 
to desertification are species-specific and mechanistic models are 
not yet able to accurately predict individual species’ responses to 
the many factors associated with desertification (Fuller et al. 2016).
1.4.2 
Impacts on socio-economic systems 
Combined impacts of desertification and climate change on 
socio-economic development in drylands are complex. Figure  3.9 
schematically represents our qualitative assessment of the 
magnitudes and the uncertainties associated with these impacts on 
attainment of the SDGs in dryland areas (UN 2015). The impacts of 
desertification and climate change are difficult to isolate from the 
effects of other socio-economic, institutional and political factors 
(Pradhan et al. 2017). However, there is high confidence that climate 
change will exacerbate the vulnerability of dryland populations 
to desertification, and that the combination of pressures coming 
from climate change and desertification will diminish opportunities 
for reducing poverty, enhancing food and nutritional security, 
empowering women, reducing disease burden, and improving 
access to water and sanitation. Desertification is embedded in 
SDG 15 (Target 15.3) and climate change is under SDG 13. The high 
confidence and high magnitude impacts depicted for these SDGs 
(Figure  3.9) indicate that the interactions between desertification 
and climate change strongly affect the achievement of the targets 
of SDGs 13 and 15.3, pointing at the need for the coordination of 
policy actions on land degradation neutrality and mitigation and 
adaptation to climate change. The following subsections present the 
literature and assessments which serve as the basis for Figure 3.9. 
1.4.2.1 
Impacts on poverty 
Climate change has a  high potential to contribute to poverty 
particularly through the risks coming from extreme weather events 
(Olsson et al. 2014). However, the evidence rigourously attributing 
changes in observed poverty to climate change impacts is currently not 
available. On the other hand, most of the research on links between 
poverty and desertification (or more broadly, land degradation) 
focused on whether or not poverty is a cause of land degradation 
(Gerber et al. 2014; Vu et al. 2014; Way 2016) (Section 4.7.1). The 
literature measuring the extent to which desertification contributed 
to poverty globally is lacking: the related literature remains qualitative 
or correlational (Barbier and Hochard 2016). At the local level, on 
the other hand, there is limited evidence and high agreement that 
desertification increased multidimensional poverty. For example, 
Diao and Sarpong (2011) estimated that land degradation lowered 
agricultural incomes in Ghana by 4.2 billion USD between 2006 and 
2015, increasing the national poverty rate by  5.4% in 2015. Land 
degradation increased the probability of households becoming poor

by 35% in Malawi and 48% in Tanzania (Kirui 2016). Desertification in 
China was found to have resulted in substantial losses in income, food 
production and jobs (Jiang et al. 2014). On the other hand, Ge et al. 
(2015) indicated that desertification was positively associated with 
growing incomes in Inner Mongolia in China in the short run since 
no costs were incurred for SLM, while in the long run higher incomes 
allowed allocation of more investments to reduce desertification. This 
relationship corresponds to the Environmental Kuznets Curve, which 
posits that environmental degradation initially rises and subsequently 
falls with rising income (e.g., Stern 2017). There is limited evidence on 
the validity of this hypothesis regarding desertification. 
1.4.2.2 
Impacts on food and nutritional insecurity 
About 821 million people globally were food insecure in 2017, of 
whom 63% in Asia, 31% in Africa and 5% in Latin America and the 
Caribbean (FAO et al. 2018). The global number of food insecure 
people rose by 37 million since 2014. Changing climate variability, 
combined with a lack of climate resilience, was suggested as a key 
driver of this increase (FAO et al. 2018). Sub-Saharan Africa, East 
Africa and South Asia had the highest share of undernourished 
populations in the world in 2017, with 28.8%, 31.4% and 33.7% 
respectively (FAO et al. 2018). The major mechanism through which 
climate change and desertification affect food security is through 
their impacts on agricultural productivity. There is robust evidence 
pointing to negative impacts of climate change on crop yields in 
dryland areas (high agreement) (Hochman et al. 2017; Nelson 
et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2017) (Sections  3.4.1,  5.2.2 and  4.7.2). 
There is also robust evidence and high agreement on the losses 
in agricultural productivity and incomes due to desertification 
(Kirui 2016; Moussa et al. 2016; Mythili and Goedecke 2016; Tun 
et al. 2015). Nkonya et al. (2016a) estimated that cultivating wheat, 
maize, and rice with unsustainable land management practices is 
currently resulting in global losses of 56.6  billion USD annually, 
with another 8.7 billion USD of annual losses due to lower livestock 
productivity caused by rangeland degradation. However, the extent 
to which these losses affected food insecurity in dryland areas 
is not known. Lower crop yields and higher agricultural prices 
worsen existing food insecurity, especially for net food-buying rural 
households and urban dwellers. Climate change and desertification 
are not the sole drivers of food insecurity, but especially in the 
areas with high dependence on agriculture, they are among the 
main contributors.

1.4.2.3 
Impacts on human health through dust storms
The frequency and intensity of dust storms are increasing due 
to land-use and land-cover changes and climate-related factors 
(Section 2.4) particularly in some regions of the world such as the 
Arabian Peninsula (Jish Prakash et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2015; Gherboudj 
et al. 2017; Notaro et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2013; Alobaidi et al. 2017; 
Maghrabi et al. 2011; Almazroui et al. 2018) and broader Middle 
East (Rashki et al. 2012; Türkeş 2017; Namdari et al. 2018) as well as 
Central Asia (Indoitu et al. 2015; Xi and Sokolik 2015), with growing 
negative impacts on human health (high confidence) (Díaz et al. 2017; 
Goudarzi et al. 2017; Goudie 2014; Samoli et al. 2011). Dust storms 
transport particulate matter, pollutants, pathogens and potential 
allergens that are dangerous for human health over long distances 
(Goudie and Middleton 2006; Sprigg 2016). Particulate matter 
(PM; that is, the suspended particles in the air of up to 10 micrometres 
(PM10) or less in size), have damaging effects on human health (Díaz 
et al. 2017; Goudarzi et al. 2017; Goudie 2014; Samoli et al. 2011). 
The health effects of dust storms are largest in areas in the immediate 
vicinity of their origin, primarily the Sahara Desert, followed by Central 
and eastern Asia, the Middle East and Australia (Zhang et al. 2016), 
however, there is robust evidence showing that the negative health 
effects of dust storms reach a much wider area (Bennett et al. 2006; 
Díaz et al. 2017; Kashima et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2014; Samoli et al. 
2011; Zhang et al. 2016). The primary health effects of dust storms 
include damage to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems 
(Goudie 2013). Dust particles with a diameter smaller than 2.5μm 
were associated with global cardiopulmonary mortality of about 
402,000 people in 2005, with 3.47 million years of life lost in that 
single year (Giannadaki et al. 2014). Although globally only 1.8% of 
cardiopulmonary deaths were caused by dust storms, in the countries 
of the Sahara region, Middle East, South and East Asia, dust storms 
were suggested to be the cause of 15–50% of all cardiopulmonary 
deaths (Giannadaki et al. 2014). A 10 μgm-3 increase in PM10 dust 
particles was associated with mean increases in non-accidental 
mortality from 0.33% to 0.51% across different calendar seasons in 
China, Japan and South Korea (Kim et al. 2017). The percentage of 
all-cause deaths attributed to fine particulate matter in Iranian cities 
affected by Middle Eastern dust storms (MED) was 0.56–5.02%, while 
the same percentage for non-affected cities was 0.16–4.13% (Hopke 
et al. 2018). Epidemics of meningococcal meningitis occur in the 
Sahelian region during the dry seasons with dusty conditions (Agier 
et al. 2012; Molesworth et al. 2003). Despite a strong concentration 
of dust storms in the Sahel, North Africa, the Middle East and Central 
Asia, there is relatively little research on human health impacts of dust 
storms in these regions. More research on health impacts and related 
costs of dust storms, as well as on public health response measures, 
can help in mitigating these health impacts.
1.4.2.4 
Impacts on gender equality
Environmental issues such as desertification and impacts of climate 
change have been increasingly investigated through a gender lens 
(Bose (n.d.); Broeckhoven and Cliquet 2015; Kaijser and Kronsell 
2014; Kiptot et al. 2014; Villamor and van Noordwijk 2016). There is 
medium evidence and high agreement that women will be impacted 
more than men by environmental degradation (Arora-Jonsson 2011; 
Gurung et al. 2006) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7). Socially 
structured gender-specific roles and responsibilities, daily activities, 
access and control over resources, decision-making and opportunities 
lead men and women to interact differently with natural resources 
and landscapes. For example, water scarcity affected women more 
than men in rural Ghana as they had to spend more time in fetching 
water, which has implications on time allocations for other activities 
(Ahmed et al. 2016). Despite the evidence pointing to differentiated 
impact of environmental degradation on women and men, gender 
issues have been marginally addressed in many land restoration 
and rehabilitation efforts, which often remain gender-blind. 
Although there is robust evidence on the location-specific impacts 
of climate change and desertification on gender equality, there is 
limited evidence on the gender-related impacts of land restoration 
and rehabilitation activities. Women are usually excluded from 
local decision-making on actions regarding desertification and 
climate change. Socially constructed gender-specific roles and 
responsibilities are not static because they are shaped by other 
factors such as wealth, age, ethnicity and formal education 
(Kaijser and Kronsell 2014; Villamor et al. 2014). Hence, women’s and 
men’s environmental knowledge and priorities for restoration often 
differ (Sijapati Basnett et al. 2017). In some areas where sustainable 
land options (e.g., agroforestry) are being promoted, women were 
not able to participate due to culturally embedded asymmetries 
in power relations between men and women (Catacutan and 
Villamor 2016). Nonetheless women, particularly in the rural areas, 
remain heavily involved in securing food for their households. Food 
security for them is associated with land productivity and women’s 
contribution to address desertification is crucial.
1.4.2.5 
 Impacts on water scarcity and use
Reduced water retention capacity of degraded soils amplifies floods 
(de la Paix et al. 2011), reinforces degradation processes through soil 
erosion, and reduces annual intake of water to aquifers, exacerbating 
existing water scarcities (Le Roux et al. 2017; Cano et al. 2018). 
Reduced vegetation cover and more intense dust storms were found to 
intensify droughts (Cook et al. 2009). Moreover, secondary salinisation 
in the irrigated drylands often requires leaching with considerable 
amounts of water (Greene et al. 2016; Wichelns and Qadir 2015). 
Thus, different types of soil degradation increase water scarcity both 
through lower water quantity and quality (Liu et al. 2017; Liu et al. 
2016c). All these processes reduce water availability for other needs. 
In this context, climate change will further intensify water scarcity in 
some dryland areas and increase the frequency of droughts (medium 
confidence) (IPCC 2013; Zheng et al. 2018) (Section 2.2). Higher water 
scarcity may imply growing use of wastewater effluents for irrigation 
(Pedrero et al. 2010). The use of untreated wastewater exacerbates 
soil degradation processes (Tal 2016; Singh et al. 2004; Qishlaqi 
et al. 2008; Hanjra et al. 2012), in addition to negative human health 
impacts (Faour-Klingbeil and Todd 2018; Hanjra et al. 2012). Climate 
change will thus amplify the need for integrated land and water 
management for sustainable development.

1.4.2.6 
Impacts on energy infrastructure through dust storms
Desertification leads to conditions that favour the production of dust 
storms (high confidence) (Section 3.3.1). There is robust evidence and 
high agreement that dust storms negatively affect the operational 
potential of solar and wind power harvesting equipment through 
dust deposition, reduced reach of solar radiation and increasing 
blade-surface roughness, and can also reduce effective electricity 
distribution in high-voltage transmission lines (Zidane et al. 2016;  
Costa et al. 2016; Lopez-Garcia et al. 2016; Maliszewski et al. 2012; 
Mani  and Pillai 2010; Mejia and Kleissl 2013; Mejia  et al. 2014; 
Middleton 2017; Sarver et al. 2013; Kaufman et al. 2002; Kok et al.  
2018). Direct exposure to desert dust storm can reduce energy 
generation efficiency of solar panels by 70–80% in one hour (Ghazi 
et al. 2014). (Saidan et al. 2016) indicated that in the conditions 
of Baghdad, Iraq, one month’s exposure to weather reduced the 
efficiency of solar modules by 18.74% due to dust deposition. In the 
Atacama desert, Chile, one month’s exposure reduced thin-film solar 
module performance by 3.7–4.8% (Fuentealba et al. 2015). This has 
important implications for climate change mitigation efforts using 
the expansion of solar and wind energy generation in dryland areas 
for substituting fossil fuels. Abundant access to solar energy in many 
dryland areas makes them high-potential locations for the installation 
of solar energy generating infrastructure. Increasing desertification, 
resulting in higher frequency and intensity of dust storms imposes 
additional costs for climate change mitigation through deployment 
of solar and wind energy harvesting facilities in dryland areas. Most 
frequently used solutions to this problem involve physically wiping 
or washing the surface of solar devices with water. These result in 
additional costs and excessive use of already scarce water resources 
and labour (Middleton 2017). The use of special coatings on the 
surface of solar panels can help prevent the deposition of dusts 
(Costa et al. 2016; Costa et al. 2018; Gholami et al. 2017). 
1.4.2.7 
Impacts on transport infrastructure through dust 
storms and sand movement 
Dust storms and movement of sand dunes often threaten the safety 
and operation of railway and road infrastructure in arid and hyper-arid 
areas, and can lead to road and airport closures due to reductions in 
visibility. For example, the dust storm on 10 March 2009 over Riyadh 
was assessed to be the strongest in the previous two decades in Saudi 
Arabia, causing limited visibility, airport shutdown and damages to 
infrastructure and environment across the city (Maghrabi et al. 2011). 
There are numerous historical examples of how moving sand dunes 
led to the forced decommissioning of early railway lines built in Sudan, 
Algeria, Namibia and Saudi Arabia in the late 19th and early 20th 
century (Bruno et al. 2018). Currently, the highest concentrations of 
railways vulnerable to sand movements are located in north-western 
China, Middle East and North Africa (Bruno et al. 2018; Cheng and 
Xue 2014). In China, sand dune movements are periodically disrupting 
the railway transport on the Linhai–Ceke line in north-western China 
and on the Lanzhou–Xinjiang High-speed Railway in western China, 
with considerable clean-up and maintenance costs (Bruno et al. 2018; 
Zhang et al. 2010). There are large-scale plans for expansion of railway 
networks in arid areas of China, Central Asia, North Africa, the Middle 
East, and eastern Africa. For example, The Belt and Road Initiative 
promoted by China, the Gulf Railway project by the Cooperation Council 
for the Arab States of the Gulf or Lamu Port–South Sudan–Ethiopia 
Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor in Eastern Africa. These investments 
have long-term return and operation periods. Their construction and 
associated engineering solutions will therefore benefit from careful 
consideration of potential desertification and climate change effects 
on sand storms and dune movements.
1.4.2.8 
Impacts on conflicts 
There is low confidence in climate change and desertification leading 
to violent conflicts. There is medium evidence and low agreement 
that climate change and desertification contribute to already existing 
conflict potentials (Herrero 2006; von Uexkull et al. 2016; Theisen 
2017; Olsson 2017; Wischnath and Buhaug 2014) (Section  4.7.3). 
To illustrate, Hsiang et al. (2013) found that each one standard 
deviation increase in temperature or rainfall was found to increase 
interpersonal violence by 4% and intergroup conflict by 14% (Hsiang 
et al. 2013). However, this conclusion was disputed by Buhaug et al. 
(2014), who found no evidence linking climate variability to violent 
conflict after replicating Hsiang et al. (2013) by studying only violent 
conflicts. Almer et al. (2017) found that a one standard deviation 
increase in dryness raised the likelihood of riots in Sub-Saharan 
African countries by 8.3% during the 1990–2011 period. On the other 
hand, Owain and Maslin (2018) found that droughts and heatwaves 
were not significantly affecting the level of regional conflict in East 
Africa. Similarly, it was suggested that droughts and desertification 
in the Sahel played a relatively minor role in the conflicts in the Sahel 
in the 1980s, with the major reasons for the conflicts during this 
period being political, especially the marginalisation of pastoralists 
(Benjaminsen 2016), corruption and rent-seeking (Benjaminsen et al. 
2012). Moreover, the role of environmental factors as the key drivers 
of conflicts was questioned in the case of Sudan (Verhoeven 2011) 
and Syria (De Châtel 2014). Selection bias, when the literature focuses 
on the same few regions where conflicts occurred and relates them 
to climate change, is a major shortcoming, as it ignores other cases 
where conflicts did not occur (Adams et al. 2018) despite degradation 
of the natural resource base and extreme weather events. 
1.4.2.9 
Impacts on migration
Environmentally induced migration is complex and accounts for 
multiple drivers of mobility as well as other adaptation measures 
undertaken by populations exposed to environmental risk (high 
confidence). There is medium evidence and low agreement that 
climate change impacts migration. The World Bank (2018) predicted 
that 143 million people would be forced to move internally by 2050 
if no climate action is taken. Focusing on asylum seekers alone, 
rather than the total number of migrants, Missirian and Schlenker 
(2017) predict that asylum applications to the European Union will 
increase from 28% (98,000 additional asylum applications per year) 
up to 188% (660,000 additional applications per year) depending 
on the climate scenario by 2100. While the modelling efforts have 
greatly improved over the years (Hunter et al. 2015; McLeman 2011; 
Sherbinin and Bai 2018) and in particular, these recent estimates 
provide an important insight into potential future developments, 
the quantitative projections are still based on the number of people 
276
Chapter 3 
Desertification

exposed to risk rather than the number of people who would 
actually engage in migration as a response to this risk (Gemenne 
2011; McLeman 2013) and they do not take into account individual 
agency in migration decision nor adaptive capacities of individuals 
(Hartmann 2010; Kniveton et al. 2011; Piguet 2010) (see Section 3.6.2 
discussing migration as a response to desertification). Accordingly, 
the available micro-level evidence suggests that climate-related 
shocks are one of the many drivers of migration (Adger et al. 2014; 
London Government Office for Science and Foresight 2011; Melde 
et al. 2017), but the individual responses to climate risk are more 
complex than commonly assumed (Gray and Mueller 2012a). For 
example, despite strong focus on natural disasters, neither flooding 
(Gray  and  Mueller 2012b; Mueller et al. 2014) nor earthquakes 
(Halliday 2006) were found to induce long-term migration; but instead, 
slow-onset changes, especially those provoking crop failures and 
heat stress, could affect household or individual migration decisions 
(Gray and Mueller 2012a; Missirian and Schlenker 2017; Mueller 
et al. 2014). Out-migration from drought-prone areas has received 
particular attention (de Sherbinin et al. 2012; Ezra and Kiros 2001). 
A substantial body of literature suggests that households engage in 
local or internal migration as a response to drought (Findlay 2011; 
Gray and Mueller 2012a), while international migration decreases 
with drought in some contexts (Henry et al. 2004), but might 
increase in contexts where migration networks are well established 
(Feng et al. 2010; Nawrotzki and DeWaard 2016; Nawrotzki et al. 
2015, 2016). Similarly, the evidence is not conclusive with respect 
to the effect of environmental drivers, in particular desertification, 
on mobility. While it has not consistently entailed out-migration in 
the case of Ecuadorian Andes (Gray 2009, 2010), environmental 
and land degradation increased mobility in Kenya and Nepal 
(Gray 2011; Massey et al. 2010), but marginally decreased mobility 
in Uganda (Gray 2011). These results suggest that in some contexts, 
environmental shocks actually undermine households’ financial 
capacity to undertake migration (Nawrotzki and Bakhtsiyarava 2017), 
especially in the case of the poorest households (Barbier and Hochard 
2018; Koubi et al. 2016; Kubik and Maurel 2016; McKenzie and Yang 
2015). Adding to the complexity, migration, especially to frontier 
areas, by increasing pressure on land and natural resources, might 
itself contribute to environmental degradation at the destination 
(Hugo 2008; IPBES 2018a; McLeman 2017). The consequences of 
migration can also be salient in the case of migration to urban or 
peri-urban areas; indeed, environmentally induced migration can 
add to urbanisation (Section 3.6.2.2), often exacerbating problems 
related to poor infrastructure and unemployment. 
1.4.2.10 Impacts on pastoral communities 
Pastoral production systems occupy a  significant portion of the 
world (Rass 2006; Dong 2016). Food insecurity among pastoral 
households is often high (Gomes 2006) (Section 3.1.3). The Sahelian 
droughts of the 1970s–1980s provided an example of how droughts 
could affect livestock resources and crop productivity, contributing 
to hunger, out-migration and suffering for millions of pastoralists 
(Hein and De Ridder 2006; Molua and Lambi 2007). During these 
Sahelian droughts low and erratic rainfall exacerbated desertification 
processes, leading to ecological changes that forced people to use 
marginal lands and ecosystems. Similarly, the rate of rangeland 
degradation is now increasing because of environmental changes 
and overexploitation of resources (Kassahun et al. 2008; Vetter 
2005). Desertification coupled with climate change is negatively 
affecting livestock feed and grazing species (Hopkins and Del Prado 
2007), changing the composition in favour of species with low forage 
quality, ultimately reducing livestock productivity (D’Odorico et al. 
2013; Dibari et al. 2016) and increasing livestock disease prevalence 
(Thornton et al. 2009). There is robust evidence and high agreement 
that weak adaptive capacity, coupled with negative effects from 
other climate-related factors, are predisposing pastoralists to 
increased poverty from desertification and climate change globally 
(López-i-Gelats et al. 2016; Giannini et al. 2008; IPCC 2007). On the 
other hand, misguided policies such as enforced sedentarisation, 
and in certain cases protected area delineation (fencing), which 
restrict livestock mobility have hampered optimal use of grazing 
land resources (Du 2012). Such policies have led to degradation of 
resources and out-migration of people in search of better livelihoods 
(Gebeye 2016; Liao et al. 2015). Restrictions on the mobile lifestyle 
are reducing the resilient adaptive capacity of pastoralists to 
natural hazards including extreme and variable weather conditions, 
drought and climate change (Schilling et al. 2014). Furthermore, the 
exacerbation of the desertification phenomenon due to agricultural 
intensification (D’Odorico et al. 2013) and land fragmentation 
caused by encroachment of agriculture into rangelands (Otuoma 
et al. 2009; Behnke and Kerven 2013) is threatening pastoral 
livelihoods. For example, commercial cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) 
production is crowding out pastoral systems in Benin (Tamou et al. 
2018). Food shortages and the urgency to produce enough crop for 
public consumption are leading to the encroachment of agriculture 
into productive rangelands and those converted rangelands are 
frequently prime lands used by pastoralists to produce feed and 
graze their livestock during dry years (Dodd 1994). The sustainability 
of pastoral systems is therefore coming into question because of 
social and political marginalisation of those systems (Davies et al. 
2016) and also because of the fierce competition they are facing from 
other livelihood sources such as crop farming (Haan et al. 2016).
1.5 
Future projections
1.5.1 
Future projections of desertification 
Assessing the impact of climate change on future desertification 
is difficult as several environmental and anthropogenic variables 
interact to determine its dynamics. The majority of modelling studies 
regarding the future evolution of desertification rely on the analysis 
of specific climate change scenarios and Global Climate Models 
(GCMs) and their effect on a few processes or drivers that trigger 
desertification (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).
With regards to climate impacts, the analysis of global and regional 
climate models concludes that under all representative concentration 
pathways (RCPs) potential evapotranspiration (PET) would increase 
worldwide as a consequence of increasing surface temperatures and 
surface water vapour deficit (Sherwood and Fu 2014). Consequently, 
there would be associated changes in aridity indices that depend on 
this variable (high agreement, robust evidence) (Cook et al. 2014a; 
277
Desertification 
Chapter 3
3
Dai 2011; Dominguez et al. 2010; Feng and Fu 2013; Ficklin et al. 2016; 
Fu et al. 2016; Greve and Seneviratne 1999; Koutroulis 2019; Scheff 
and Frierson 2015). Due to the large increase in PET and decrease 
in precipitation over some subtropical land areas, aridity index will 
decrease in some drylands (Zhao and Dai 2015), with one model 
estimating approximately 10% increase in hyper-arid areas globally 
(Zeng and Yoon 2009). Increases in PET are projected to continue 
due to climate change (Cook et al. 2014a; Fu et al. 2016; Lin et al. 
2015; Scheff and Frierson 2015). However, as noted in Sections 3.1.1 
and 3.2.1, these PET calculations use assumptions that are not valid 
in an environment with changing CO2. Evidence from precipitation, 
runoff or photosynthetic uptake of CO2 suggest that a future warmer 
world will be less arid (Roderick et al. 2015). Observations in recent 
decades indicate that the Hadley cell has expanded poleward in 
both hemispheres (Fu et al. 2006; Hu and Fu 2007; Johanson et al. 
2009; Seidel and Randel 2007), and under all RCPs would continue 
expanding (Johanson et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2007). This expansion leads 
to the poleward extension of subtropical dry zones and hence an 
expansion in drylands on the poleward edge (Scheff and Frierson 
2012). Overall, this suggests that while aridity will increase in some 
places (high confidence), there is insufficient evidence to suggest 
a global change in dryland aridity (medium confidence).
Regional modelling studies confirm the outcomes of Global Climate 
Models (Africa: Terink et al. 2013; China: Yin et al. 2015; Brazil: Marengo 
and Bernasconi 2015; Cook et al. 2012; Greece: Nastos et al. 2013; 
Italy: Coppola and Giorgi 2009). According to the IPCC AR5 (IPCC 
2013), decreases in soil moisture are detected in the Mediterranean, 
southwest USA and southern African regions. This is in line with 
alterations in the Hadley circulation and higher surface temperatures. 
This surface drying will continue to the end of this century under the 
RCP8.5 scenario (high confidence). Ramarao et al. (2015) showed that 
a future climate projection based on RCP4.5 scenario indicated the 
possibility for detecting the summer-time soil drying signal over the 
Indian region during the 21st century in response to climate change. 
The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) (Chapter 3; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018) concluded with ‘medium confidence’ that 
global warming by more than 1.5°C increases considerably the risk of 
aridity for the Mediterranean area and southern Africa. Miao et al. 
(2015b) showed an acceleration of desertification trends under the 
RCP8.5 scenario in the middle and northern part of Central Asia and 
some parts of north-western China. It is also useful to consider the  
effects of the dynamic–thermodynamical feedback of the climate. 
Schewe and Levermann (2017) show increases of up to 300% 
in the Central Sahel rainfall by the end of the century due to an 
expansion of the West African monsoon. Warming could trigger an 
intensification of monsoonal precipitation due to increases in ocean 
moisture availability.
The impacts of climate change on dust storm activity are not yet 
comprehensively studied and represent an important knowledge 
gap. Currently, GCMs are unable to capture recent observed dust 
emission and transport (Evan 2018; Evan et al. 2014), limiting 
confidence in future projections. Literature suggests that climate 
change decreases wind erosion/dust emission overall, with regional 
variation (low confidence). Mahowald et al. (2006) and Mahowald 
(2007) found that climate change led to a decrease in desert dust 
source areas globally using CMIP3 GCMs. Wang et al. (2009) found 
a decrease in sand dune movement by 2039 (increasing thereafter) 
when assessing future wind-erosion-driven desertification in arid 
and semi-arid China using a range of SRES scenarios and HadCM3 
simulations. Dust activity in the Southern Great Plains in the USA 
was projected to increase, while in the Northern Great Plains it was 
projected to decrease under RCP8.5 climate change scenario (Pu and 
Ginoux 2017). Evan et al. (2016) project a decrease in African dust 
emission associated with a slowdown of the tropical circulation in 
the high CO2 RCP8.5 scenario. 
Global estimates of the impact of climate change on soil salinisation 
show that under the IS92a emissions scenario (a scenario prepared 
in 1992 that contains ‘business as usual’ assumptions) (Leggett et al. 
1992) the area at risk of salinisation would increase in the future 
(limited evidence, high agreement) (Schofield and Kirkby 2003). 
Climate change has an influence on soil salinisation that induces 
further land degradation through several mechanisms that vary in 
their level of complexity. However, only a few examples can be found 
to illustrate this range of impacts, including the effect of groundwater 
table depletion (Rengasamy 2006) and irrigation management 
(Sivakumar 2007), salt migration in coastal aquifers with decreasing 
water tables (Sherif and Singh 1999) (Section 4.10.7), and surface 
hydrology and vegetation that affect wetlands and favour salinisation 
(Nielsen and Brock 2009).
1.5.1.1 
Future vulnerability and risk of desertification
Following the conceptual framework developed in the Special 
Report on extreme events (SREX) (IPCC 2012), future risks are 
assessed by examining changes in exposure (that is, presence of 
people; livelihoods; species or ecosystems; environmental functions, 
service, and resources; infrastructure; or economic, social or cultural 
assets; see Glossary), changes in vulnerability (that is, propensity or 
predisposition to be adversely affected; see Glossary) and changes in 
the nature and magnitude of hazards (that is, potential occurrence 
of a natural or human-induced physical event that causes damage; 
see Glossary). Climate change is expected to further exacerbate the 
vulnerability of dryland ecosystems to desertification by increasing 
PET globally (Sherwood and Fu 2014). Temperature increases 
between 2°C and 4°C are projected in drylands by the end of the 
21st century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively (IPCC 
2013). An assessment by Carrão et al. 2017 showed an increase in 
drought hazards by late-century (2071–2099) compared to a baseline 
(1971–2000) under high RCPs in drylands around the Mediterranean, 
south-eastern Africa, and southern Australia. In Latin America, 
Morales et al. (2011) indicated that areas affected by drought will 
increase significantly by 2100 under SRES scenarios A2 and B2. The 
countries expected to be affected include Guatemala, El Salvador, 
Honduras and Nicaragua. In CMIP5 scenarios, Mediterranean types 
of climate are projected to become drier (Alessandri et al. 2014; 
Polade et al. 2017), with the equatorward margins being potentially 
replaced by arid climate types (Alessandri et al. 2014). Globally, 
climate change is predicted to intensify the occurrence and severity 
of droughts (medium confidence) (Dai 2013; Sheffield and Wood 
2008; Swann et al. 2016; Wang 2005; Zhao and Dai 2015; Carrão 
et al. 2017; Naumann et al. 2018) (Section 2.2). Ukkola et al. (2018) 
278
Chapter 3 
Desertification

showed large discrepancies between CMIP5 models for all types of 
droughts, limiting the confidence that can be assigned to projections 
of drought.
Drylands are characterised by high climatic variability. Climate 
impacts on desertification are not only defined by projected trends 
in mean temperature and precipitation values but are also strongly 
dependent on changes in climate variability and extremes (Reyer et al. 
2013). The responses of ecosystems depend on diverse vegetation 
types. Drier ecosystems are more sensitive to changes in precipitation 
and temperature (Li et al. 2018; Seddon et al. 2016; You et al. 2018), 
increasing vulnerability to desertification. It has also been reported 
that areas with high variability in precipitation tend to have lower 
livestock densities and that those societies that have a  strong 
dependence on livestock that graze natural forage are especially 
affected (Sloat et al. 2018). Social vulnerability in drylands increases 
as a  consequence of climate change that threatens the viability 
of pastoral food systems (Dougill et al. 2010; López-i-Gelats et al. 
2016). Social drivers can also play an important role with regards to 
future vulnerability (Máñez Costa et al. 2011). In the arid region of 
north-western China, Liu et al. (2016b) estimated that under RCP4.5 
areas of increased vulnerability to climate change and desertification 
will surpass those with decreased vulnerability. 
Using an ensemble of global climate, integrated assessment 
and impact models, Byers et al. (2018) investigated 14 impact 
indicators at different levels of global mean temperature change 
and socio-economic development. The indicators cover water, energy 
and land sectors. Of particular relevance to desertification are the 
water (e.g., water stress, drought intensity) and the land (e.g., habitat 
degradation) indicators. Under shared socio-economic pathway 
SSP2 (‘Middle of the Road’) at 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming, 
the numbers of dryland populations exposed (vulnerable) to various 
impacts related to water, energy and land sectors (e.g., water stress, 
drought intensity, habitat degradation) are projected to reach 951 
(178) million, 1152 (220) million and 1285 (277) million, respectively. 
While at global warming of 2°C, under SSP1 (‘Sustainability’), the 
exposed (vulnerable) dryland population is 974 (35) million, and under 
SSP3 (‘Fragmented World’) it is 1267 (522) million. Steady increases 
in the exposed and vulnerable populations are seen for increasing 
global mean temperatures. However much larger differences are 
seen in the vulnerable population under different SSPs. Around half 
the vulnerable population is in South Asia, followed by Central Asia, 
West Africa and East Asia.
1.5.2 
Future projections of impacts
Future climate change is expected to increase the potential for 
increased soil erosion by water in dryland areas (medium confidence). 
Yang et al. (2003) use a Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) 
model to study global soil erosion under historical, present and 
future conditions of both cropland and climate. Soil erosion potential 
has increased by about 17%, and climate change will increase this 
further in the future. In northern Iran, under the SRES A2 emission 
scenario the mean erosion potential is projected to grow by 45%, 
comparing the period 1991–2010 with 2031–2050 (Zare et al. 2016). 
A strong decrease in precipitation for almost all parts of Turkey was 
projected for the period 2021–2050 compared to 1971–2000 using 
Regional Climate Model, RegCM4.4 of the International Centre for 
Theoretical Physics (ICTP) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Türkeş 
et al. 2019). The projected changes in precipitation distribution can 
lead to more extreme precipitation events and prolonged droughts, 
increasing Turkey’s vulnerability to soil erosion. In Portugal, a study 
comparing wet and dry catchments under A1B and B1 emission 
scenarios showed an increase in erosion in dry catchments (Serpa 
et al. 2015). In Morocco an increase in sediment load is projected as 
a consequence of reduced precipitation (Simonneaux et al. 2015). 
WGII AR5 concluded the impact of increases in heavy rainfall and 
temperature on soil erosion will be modulated by soil management 
practices, rainfall seasonality and land cover (Jiménez Cisneros 
et al. 2014). Ravi et al. (2010) predicted an increase in hydrologic 
and aeolian soil erosion processes as a  consequence of droughts 
in drylands. However, there are some studies that indicate that 
soil erosion will be reduced in Spain (Zabaleta et al. 2013), Greece 
(Nerantzaki et al. 2015) and Australia (Klik and Eitzinger 2010), while 
others project changes in erosion as a consequence of the expansion 
of croplands (Borrelli et al. 2017).
Potential dryland expansion implies lower carbon sequestration 
and higher risk of desertification (Huang et al. 2017), with severe 
impacts on land usability and threats to food security. At the level 
of biomes (global-scale zones, generally defined by the type of plant 
life that they support in response to average rainfall and temperature 
patterns; see Glossary), soil carbon uptake is determined mostly by 
weather variability. The area of the land in which dryness controls 
CO2 exchange has risen by 6% since 1948 and is projected to expand 
by at least another 8% by 2050. In these regions net carbon uptake 
is about 27% lower than elsewhere (Yi et al. 2014). Potential losses 
of soil carbon are projected to range from 9% to 12% of the total 
carbon stock in the  0–20 cm layer of soils in southern European 
Russia by end of this century (Ivanov et al. 2018).
Desertification under climate change will threaten biodiversity in 
drylands (medium confidence). Rodriguez-Caballero et al. (2018) 
analysed the cover of biological soil crusts under current and 
future environmental conditions utilising an environmental niche 
modelling approach. Their results suggest that biological soil crusts 
currently cover approximately 1600 Mha in drylands. Under RCP 
scenarios  2.6 to  8.5, 25–40% of this cover will be lost by 2070 
with climate and land use contributing equally. The predicted loss 
is expected to substantially reduce the contribution of biological 
soil crusts to nitrogen cycling (6.7–9.9 TgN yr−1) and carbon cycling 
(0.16–0.24 PgC yr−1) (Rodriguez-Caballero et al. 2018). A study in 
Colorado Plateau, USA showed that changes in climate in drylands 
may damage the biocrust communities by promoting rapid mortality 
of foundational species (Rutherford et al. 2017), while in the Southern 
California deserts climate change-driven extreme heat and drought 
may surpass the survival thresholds of some desert species (Bachelet 
et al. 2016). In semi-arid Mediterranean shrublands in eastern Spain, 
plant species richness and plant cover could be reduced by climate 
change and soil erosion (García-Fayos and Bochet 2009). The main 
drivers of species extinctions are land-use change, habitat pollution, 
over-exploitation, and species invasion, while climate change is 
279
Desertification 
Chapter 3

indirectly linked to species extinctions (Settele et al. 2014). Malcolm 
et al. (2006) found that more than 2000 plant species located within 
dryland biodiversity hotspots could become extinct within 100 years, 
starting 2004 (within the Cape Floristic Region, Mediterranean Basin 
and southwest Australia). Furthermore, it is suggested that land use 
and climate change could cause the loss of 17% of species within 
shrublands and 8% within hot deserts by 2050 (low confidence) (van 
Vuuren et al. 2006). A study in the semi-arid Chinese Altai Mountains 
showed that mammal species richness will decline, rates of species 
turnover will increase, and more than 50% of their current ranges 
will be lost (Ye et al. 2018).
Changing climate and land use have resulted in higher aridity and 
more droughts in some drylands, with the rising role of precipitation, 
wind and evaporation on desertification (Fischlin et al. 2007). In a 2°C 
world, annual water discharge is projected to decline, and heatwaves 
are projected to pose risk to food production by 2070 (Waha et al. 
2017). However, Betts et al. (2018) found a mixed response of water 
availability (runoff) in dryland catchments to global temperature 
increases from 1.5°C to 2°C. The forecasts for Sub-Saharan Africa 
suggest that higher temperatures, increase in the number of 
heatwaves, and increasing aridity, will affect the rainfed agricultural 
systems (Serdeczny et al. 2017). A study by Wang et al. (2009) in arid 
and semi-arid China showed decreased livestock productivity and 
grain yields from 2040 to 2099, threatening food security. In Central 
Asia, projections indicate a  decrease in crop yields, and negative 
impacts of prolonged heat waves on population health (Reyer et al. 
2017) (Section 3.7.2). World Bank (2009) projected that, without the 
carbon fertilisation effect, climate change will reduce the mean yields 
for 11 major global crops – millet, field pea, sugar beet, sweet potato, 
wheat, rice, maize, soybean, groundnut, sunflower and rapeseed – by 
15% in Sub-Saharan Africa, 11% in Middle East and North Africa, 
18% in South Asia, and 6% in Latin America and the Caribbean by 
2046–2055, compared to 1996–2005. A  separate meta-analysis 
suggested a  similar reduction in yields in Africa and South Asia 
due to climate change by 2050 (Knox et al. 2012). Schlenker and 
Lobell (2010) estimated that in sub-Saharan Africa, crop production 
may be reduced by 17–22% due to climate change by 2050. At the 
local level, climate change impacts on crop yields vary by location 
(Section 5.2.2). Negative impacts of climate change on agricultural 
productivity contribute to higher food prices. The imbalance between 
supply and demand for agricultural products is projected to increase 
agricultural prices in the range of 31% for rice, to 100% for maize 
by 2050 (Nelson et al. 2010), and cereal prices in the range between 
a 32% increase and a 16% decrease by 2030 (Hertel et al. 2010). 
In southern European Russia, it is projected that the yields of grain 
crops will decline by 5–10% by 2050 due to the higher intensity and 
coverage of droughts (Ivanov et al. 2018).
Climate change can have strong impacts on poverty in drylands 
(medium confidence) (Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017; Hertel and 
Lobell 2014). Globally, Hallegatte et al. (2015) project that without 
rapid and inclusive progress on eradicating multidimensional poverty, 
climate change could increase the number of the people living in 
poverty by between 35  million and 122  million people by 2030. 
Although these numbers are global and not specific to drylands, the 
highest impacts in terms of the share of the national populations 
being affected are projected to be in the drylands areas of the Sahel 
region, eastern Africa and South Asia (Stephane Hallegatte et al. 
2015). The impacts of climate change on poverty vary depending on 
whether the household is a net agricultural buyer or seller. Modelling 
results showed that poverty rates would increase by about one-third 
among the urban households and non-agricultural self-employed in 
Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Bangladesh due to high agricultural 
prices and low agricultural productivity under climate change (Hertel 
et al. 2010). On the contrary, modelled poverty rates fell substantially 
among agricultural households in Chile, Indonesia, the Philippines 
and Thailand, because higher prices compensated for productivity 
losses (Hertel et al. 2010).
1.6 
Responses to desertification under 
climate change 
Achieving sustainable development of dryland livelihoods requires 
avoiding dryland degradation through SLM and restoring and 
rehabilitating the degraded drylands due to their potential wealth 
of ecosystem benefits and importance to human livelihoods and 
economies (Thomas 2008). A broad suite of on-the-ground response 
measures exists to address desertification (Scholes 2009), be it in the 
form of improved fire and grazing management, the control of erosion; 
integrated crop, soil and water management, among others (Liniger 
and Critchley 2007; Scholes 2009). These actions are part of the 
broader context of dryland development and long-term SLM within 
coupled socio-economic systems (Reynolds et al. 2007; Stringer et al. 
2017; Webb et al. 2017). Many of these response options correspond 
to those grouped under ‘land transitions’ in the IPCC Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5°C (Coninck et al. 2018) (Table 6.4). It is 
therefore recognised that such actions require financial, institutional 
and policy support for their wide-scale adoption and sustainability 
over time (Sections 3.6.3, 4.8.5 and 6.4.4).
1.6.1 
SLM technologies and practices:  
On-the-ground actions 
A broad range of activities and measures can help avoid, reduce and 
reverse degradation across the dryland areas of the world. Many 
of these actions also contribute to climate change adaptation and 
mitigation, with further sustainable development co-benefits for 
poverty eradication and food security (high confidence) (Section 6.3). 
As preventing desertification is strongly preferable and more 
cost-effective than allowing land to degrade and then attempting 
to restore it (IPBES 2018b; Webb et al. 2013), there is a growing 
emphasis on avoiding and reducing land degradation, following the 
Land Degradation Neutrality framework (Cowie et al. 2018; Orr et al. 
2017) (Section 4.8.5).
An assessment is made of six activities and measures practicable 
across the biomes and anthromes of the dryland domain (Figure 3.10). 
This suite of actions is not exhaustive, but rather a set of activities 
that are particularly pertinent to global dryland ecosystems. 
They are not necessarily exclusive to drylands and are often 
implemented across a range of biomes and anthromes (Figure 3.10; 
280
Chapter 3 
Desertification

for afforestation, see Section  3.7.2, Cross-Chapter Box  2  in 
Chapter 1, and Chapter 4 (Section 4.8.3)). The use of anthromes as 
a structuring element for response options is based on the essential 
role of interactions between social and ecological systems in driving 
desertification within coupled socio-ecological systems (Cherlet et al. 
2018). The concept of the anthromes is defined in the Glossary and 
explored further in Chapters 1, 4 and 6.
The assessment of each action is twofold: firstly, to assess the ability 
of each action to address desertification and enhance climate change 
resilience, and secondly, to assess the potential impact of future 
climate change on the effectiveness of each action. 
1.6.1.1 
Integrated crop–soil–water management
Forms of integrated cropland management have been practiced in 
drylands for thousands of years (Knörzer et al. 2009). Actions include 
planting a diversity of species including drought-resilient ecologically 
appropriate plants, reducing tillage, applying organic compost and 
fertiliser, adopting different forms of irrigation and maintaining 
vegetation and mulch cover. In the contemporary era, several of 
these actions have been adopted in response to climate change. 
In terms of climate change adaptation, the resilience of agriculture 
to the impacts of climate change is strongly influenced by the 
underlying health and stability of soils as well as improvements in 
crop varieties, irrigation efficiency and supplemental irrigation, for 
example, through rainwater harvesting (medium evidence, high 
agreement) (Altieri et al. 2015; Amundson et al. 2015; Derpsch et al. 
2010; Lal 1997; de Vries et al. 2012). Desertification often leads to 
a reduction in ground cover that in turn results in accelerated water 
and wind erosion and an associated loss of fertile topsoil that can 
greatly reduce the resilience of agriculture to climate change (medium 
evidence, high agreement) (Touré et al. 2019; Amundson et al. 2015; 
Borrelli et al. 2017; Pierre et al. 2017). Amadou et al. (2011) note that 
even a minimal cover of crop residues (100 kg ha–1) can substantially 
decrease wind erosion. 
Compared to conventional (flood or furrow) irrigation, drip irrigation 
methods are more efficient in supplying water to the plant root 
zone, resulting in lower water requirements and enhanced water 
use efficiency (robust evidence, high agreement) (Ibragimov et al. 
2007; Narayanamoorthy 2010; Niaz et al. 2009). For example, in the 
rainfed area of Fetehjang, Pakistan, the adoption of drip methods 
reduced water usage by 67–68% during the production of tomato, 
cucumber and bell peppers, resulting in a 68–79% improvement in 
water use efficiency compared to previous furrow irrigation (Niaz 
et al. 2009). In India, drip irrigation reduced the amount of water 
consumed in the production of sugarcane by 44%, grapes by 37%, 
bananas by 29% and cotton by 45%, while enhancing yields by 
up to 29% (Narayanamoorthy 2010). Similarly, in Uzbekistan, drip 
irrigation increased the yield of cotton by 10–19% while reducing 
water requirements by 18–42% (Ibragimov et al. 2007).
A prominent response that addresses soil loss, health and cover is 
altering cropping methods. The adoption of intercropping (inter  – 
and intra-row planting of companion crops) and relay cropping 
(temporally differentiated planting of companion crops) maintains 
soil cover over a larger fraction of the year, leading to an increase 
in production, soil nitrogen, species diversity and a  decrease in 
pest abundance (robust evidence, medium agreement) (Altieri and 
Koohafkan 2008; Tanveer et al. 2017; Wilhelm and Wortmann 2004). 
For example, intercropping maize and sorghum with Desmodium (an 
insect repellent forage legume) and Brachiaria (an insect trapping 
grass), which is being promoted in drylands of East Africa, led to 
a two-to-three-fold increase in maize production and an 80% decrease

in stem boring insects (Khan et al. 2014). In addition to changes in 
cropping methods, forms of agroforestry and shelterbelts are often 
used to reduce erosion and improve soil conditions (Section 3.7.2). 
For example, the use of tree belts of mixed species in northern China 
led to a reduction of surface wind speed and an associated reduction 
in soil temperature of up to 40% and an increase in soil moisture of 
up to 30% (Wang et al. 2008).
A further measure that can be of increasing importance under climate 
change is rainwater harvesting (RWH), including traditional zai (small 
basins used to capture surface runoff), earthen bunds and ridges 
(Nyamadzawo et al. 2013), fanya juus infiltration pits (Nyagumbo et al. 
2019), contour stone bunds (Garrity et al. 2010) and semi-permeable 
stone bunds (often referred to by the French term digue filtrante) 
(Taye et al. 2015). RWH increases the amount of water available for 
agriculture and livelihoods through the capture and storage of runoff, 
while at the same time reducing the intensity of peak flows following 
high-intensity rainfall events. It is therefore often highlighted as 
a practical response to dryness (i.e., long-term aridity and low seasonal 
precipitation) and rainfall variability, both of which are projected to 
become more acute over time in some dryland areas (Dile et al. 2013; 
Vohland and Barry 2009). For example, for drainage in Wadi Al-Lith, 
Saudi Arabia, the use of rainwater harvesting was suggested as a key 
climate change adaptation action (Almazroui et al. 2017). There is 
robust evidence and high agreement that the implementation of RWH 
systems leads to an increase in agricultural production in drylands 
(Biazin et al. 2012; Bouma and Wösten 2016; Dile et al. 2013). A global 
meta-analysis of changes in crop production due to the adoption 
of RWH techniques noted an average increase in yields of 78%, 
ranging from –28% to 468% (Bouma and Wösten 2016). Of particular 
relevance to climate change in drylands is that the relative impact of 
RWH on agricultural production generally increases with increasing 
dryness. Relative yield improvements due to the adoption of RWH 
were significantly higher in years with less than 330 mm rainfall, 
compared to years with more than 330 mm (Bouma and Wösten 
2016). Despite delivering a clear set of benefits, there are some issues 
that need to be considered. The impact of RWH may vary at different 
temporal and spatial scales (Vohland and Barry 2009). At a plot scale, 
RWH structures may increase available water and enhance agricultural 
production, SOC and nutrient availability, yet at a catchment scale, 
they may reduce runoff to downstream uses (Meijer et al. 2013; Singh 
et al. 2012; Vohland and Barry 2009; Yosef and Asmamaw 2015). 
Inappropriate storage of water in warm climes can lead to an increase 
in water related diseases unless managed correctly, for example, 
schistosomiasis and malaria (Boelee et al. 2013). 
Integrated crop–soil–water management may also deliver climate 
change mitigation benefits through avoiding, reducing and reversing 
the loss of SOC (Table 6.5). Approximately 20–30 Pg of SOC have 
been released into the atmosphere through desertification processes, 
for example, deforestation, overgrazing and conventional tillage 
(Lal 2004). Activities, such as those associated with conservation 
agriculture (minimising tillage, crop rotation, maintaining organic 
cover and planting a diversity of species), reduce erosion, improve 
water use efficiency and primary production, increase inflow of 
organic material and enhance SOC over time, contributing to climate 
change mitigation and adaptation (high confidence) (Plaza-Bonilla 
et al. 2015; Lal 2015; Srinivasa Rao et al. 2015; Sombrero and de Benito 
2010). Conservation agriculture practices also lead to increases in 
SOC (medium confidence). However, sustained carbon sequestration 
is dependent on net primary productivity and on the availability of 
crop-residues that may be relatively limited and often consumed by 
livestock or used elsewhere in dryland contexts (Cheesman et al. 
2016; Plaza-Bonilla et al. 2015). For this reason, expected rates of 
carbon sequestration following changes in agricultural practices 
in drylands are relatively low (0.04–0.4 tC ha–1) and it may take 
a protracted period of time, even several decades, for carbon stocks 
to recover if lost (medium confidence) (Farage et al. 2007; Hoyle et al. 
2013; Lal 2004). This long recovery period enforces the rationale for 
prioritising the avoidance and reduction of land degradation and loss 
of C, in addition to restoration activities. 
1.6.1.2 
Grazing and fire management in drylands
Rangeland management systems such as sustainable grazing 
approaches and re-vegetation increase rangeland productivity (high 
confidence) (Table  6.5). Open grassland, savannah and woodland 
are home to the majority of world’s livestock production (Safriel 
et al. 2005). Within these drylands areas, prevailing grazing and fire 
regimes play an important role in shaping the relative abundance 
of trees versus grasses (Scholes and Archer 1997; Staver et al. 2011; 
Stevens et al. 2017), as well as the health of the grass layer in 
terms of primary production, species richness and basal cover (the 
propotion of the plant that is in the soil) (Plaza-Bonilla et al. 2015; 
Short et al. 2003). This in turn influences levels of soil erosion, soil 
nutrients, secondary production and additional ecosystem services 
(Divinsky et al. 2017; Pellegrini et al. 2017). A further set of drivers, 
including soil type, annual rainfall and changes in atmospheric CO2 
may also define observed rangeland structure and composition 
(Devine et al. 2017; Donohue et al. 2013), but the two principal 
factors that pastoralists can manage are grazing and fire, by altering 
their frequency, type and intensity.
The impact of grazing and fire regimes on biodiversity, soil nutrients, 
primary production and further ecosystem services is not constant 
and varies between locations (Divinsky et al. 2017; Fleischner 
1994; van Oijen et al. 2018). Trade-offs may therefore need to be 
considered to ensure that rangeland diversity and production are 
resilient to climate change (Plaza-Bonilla et al. 2015; van Oijen et al. 
2018). In certain locations, even light to moderate grazing has led 
to a  significant decrease in the occurrence of particular species, 
especially forbs (O’Connor et al. 2011; Scott-shaw and Morris 2015). 
In other locations, species richness is only significantly impacted by 
heavy grazing and is able to withstand light to moderate grazing 
(Divinsky et al. 2017). A context specific evaluation of how grazing 
and fire impact particular species may therefore be required to 
ensure the persistence of target species over time (Marty 2005). 
A similar trade-off may need to be considered between soil carbon 
sequestration and livestock production. As noted by Plaza-Bonilla 
et al. (2015) increasing grazing pressure has been found to increase 
SOC stocks in some locations, and decrease them in others. Where it 
has led to a decrease in soil carbon stocks, for example in Mongolia 
(Han et al. 2008) and Ethiopia (Bikila et al. 2016), trade-offs between 
282
Chapter 3

carbon sequestration and the value of livestock to local livelihoods 
need be considered.
Although certain herbaceous species may be unable to tolerate 
grazing pressure, a  complete lack of grazing or fire may not be 
desired in terms of ecosystems health. It can lead to a decrease in 
basal cover and the accumulation of moribund, unpalatable biomass 
that inhibits primary production (Manson et al. 2007; Scholes 2009). 
The utilisation of the grass sward through light to moderate grazing 
stimulates the growth of biomass and basal cover, and allows water 
services to be sustained over time (Papanastasis et al. 2017; Scholes 
2009). Even moderate to heavy grazing in periods of higher rainfall 
may be sustainable, but constant heavy grazing during dry periods, 
and especially droughts, can lead to a reduction in basal cover, SOC, 
biological soil crusts, ecosystem services and an accelerated erosion 
(high agreement, robust evidence) (Archer et al. 2017; Conant and 
Paustian 2003; D’Odorico et al. 2013; Geist and Lambin 2004; Havstad 
et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2007; Manzano and Návar 2000; Pointing 
and Belnap 2012; Weber et al. 2016). For this reason, the inclusion 
of drought forecasts and contingency planning in grazing and fire 
management programmes is crucial to avoid desertification (Smith 
and Foran 1992; Torell et al. 2010). It is an important component of 
avoiding and reducing early degradation. Although grasslands systems 
may be relatively resilient and can often recover from a moderately 
degraded state (Khishigbayar et al. 2015; Porensky et al. 2016), if 
a tipping point has been exceeded, restoration to a historic state may 
not be economical or ecologically feasible (D’Odorico et al. 2013). 
Together with livestock management (Table 6.5), the use of fire is 
an integral part of rangeland management, which can be applied to 
remove moribund and unpalatable forage, exotic weeds and woody 
species (Archer et al. 2017). Fire has less of an effect on SOC and soil 
nutrients in comparison to grazing (Abril et al. 2005), yet elevated 
fire frequency has been observed to lead to a decrease in soil carbon 
and nitrogen (Abril et al. 2005; Bikila et al. 2016; Bird et al. 2000; 
Pellegrini et al. 2017). Although the impact of climate change on fire 
frequency and intensity may not be clear due to its differing impact 
on fuel accumulation, suitable weather conditions and sources of 
ignition (Abatzoglou et al. 2018; Littell et al. 2018; Moritz et al. 2012), 
there is an increasing use of prescribed fire to address several global 
change phenomena, for example, the spread of invasive species 
and bush encroachment, as well as the threat of intense runaway 
fires (Fernandes et al. 2013; McCaw 2013; van Wilgen et al. 2010). 
Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2 provides a further review of the 
interaction between fire and climate change. 
There is often much emphasis on reducing and reversing the 
degradation of rangelands due to the wealth of benefits they provide, 
especially in the context of assisting dryland communities to adapt to 
climate change (Webb et al. 2017; Woollen et al. 2016). The emerging 
concept of ecosystem-based adaptation has highlighted the broad 
range of important ecosystem services that healthy rangelands can 
provide in a  resilient manner to local residents and downstream 
economies (Kloos and Renaud 2016; Reid et al. 2018). In terms of 
climate change mitigation, the contribution of rangelands, woodland 
and sub-humid dry forest (e.g., Miombo woodland in south-central 
Africa) is often undervalued due to relatively low carbon stocks 
per hectare. Yet due to their sheer extent, the amount of carbon 
sequestered in these ecosystems is substantial and can make 
a  valuable contribution to climate change mitigation (Lal 2004; 
Pelletier et al. 2018).
1.6.1.3 
Clearance of bush encroachment
The encroachment of open grassland and savannah ecosystems by 
woody species has occurred for at least the past 100 years (Archer 
et al. 2017; O’Connor et al. 2014; Schooley et al. 2018). Dependent on 
the type and intensity of encroachment, it may lead to a net loss of 
ecosystem services and be viewed as a form of desertification (Dougill 
et al. 2016; O’Connor et al. 2014). However, there are circumstances 
where bush encroachment may lead to a net increase in ecosystem 
services, especially at intermediate levels of encroachment, where the 
ability of the landscape to produce fodder for livestock is retained, 
while the production of wood and associated products increases 
(Eldridge et al. 2011; Eldridge and Soliveres 2014). This may be 
particularly important in regions such as southern Africa and India 
where over 65% of rural households depend on fuelwood from 
surrounding landscapes as well as livestock production (Komala and 
Prasad 2016; Makonese et al. 2017; Shackleton and Shackleton 2004).
This variable relationship between the level of encroachment, carbon 
stocks, biodiversity, provision of water and pastoral value (Eldridge 
and Soliveres 2014) can present a  conundrum to policymakers, 
especially when considering the goals of three Rio Conventions: 
UNFCCC, UNCCD and UNCBD. Clearing intense bush encroachment 
may improve species diversity, rangeland productivity, the provision 
of water and decrease desertification, thereby contributing to the 
goals of the UNCBD and UNCCD as well as the adaptation aims 
of the UNFCCC. However, it would lead to the release of biomass 
carbon stocks into the atmosphere and potentially conflict with the 
mitigation aims of the UNFCCC. 
For example, Smit et al. (2015) observed an average increase in 
above-ground woody carbon stocks of 44 tC ha–1 in savannahs in 
northern Namibia. However, since bush encroachment significantly 
inhibited livestock production, there are often substantial efforts 
to clear woody species (Stafford-Smith et al. 2017). Namibia has 
a national programme, currently in its early stages, aimed at clearing 
woody species through mechanical measures (harvesting of trees) as 
well as the application of arboricides (Smit et al. 2015). However, the 
long-term success of clearance and subsequent improved fire and 
grazing management remains to be evaluated, especially restoration 
back towards an ‘original open grassland state’. For example, in 
northern Namibia, the rapid reestablishment of woody seedlings 
has raised questions about whether full clearance and restoration 
is possible (Smit et al. 2015). In arid landscapes, the potential 
impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 (Donohue et al. 2013; Kgope 
et al. 2010) and opportunity to implement high-intensity fires that 
remove woody species and maintain rangelands in an open state 
has been questioned (Bond and Midgley 2000). If these drivers of 
woody plant encroachment cannot be addressed, a  new form of 
‘emerging ecosystem’ (Milton 2003) may need to be explored that 
includes both improved livestock and fire management as well as 
the utilisation of biomass as a  long-term commodity and source 
283
Desertification 
Chapter 3

of revenue (Smit et al. 2015). Initial studies in Namibia and South 
Africa (Stafford-Smith et al. 2017) indicate that there may be good 
opportunity to produce sawn timber, fencing poles, fuelwood and 
commercial energy,  but factors such as the cost of transport can 
substantially influence the financial feasibility of implementation. 
The benefit of proactive management that prevents land from being 
degraded (altering grazing systems or treating bush encroachment 
at early stages before degradation has been initiated) is more 
cost-effective in the long term and adds more resistance to climate 
change than treating lands after degradation has occurred (Webb 
et al. 2013; Weltz and Spaeth 2012). The challenge is getting 
producers to alter their management paradigm from short-term 
objectives to long-term objectives. 
1.6.1.4 
Combating sand and dust storms through  
sand dune stabilisation
Dust and sand storms have a considerable impact on natural and 
human systems (Sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2). Application of sand dune 
stabilisation techniques contributes to reducing sand and dust 
storms (high confidence). Using a number of methods, sand dune 
stabilisation aims to avoid and reduce the occurrence of dust and 
sand storms (Mainguet and Dumay 2011). Mechanical techniques 
include building palisades to prevent the movement of sand and 
reduce sand deposits on infrastructure. Chemical methods include 
the use of calcium bentonite or using silica gel to fix mobile sand 
(Aboushook et al. 2012; Rammal and Jubair 2015). Biological 
methods include the use of mulch to stabilise surfaces (Sebaa et al. 
2015; Yu et al. 2004) and establishing permanent plant cover using 
pasture species that improve grazing at the same time (Abdelkebir 
and Ferchichi 2015; Zhang et al. 2015) (Section 3.7.1.3). When the 
dune is stabilised, woody perennials are introduced that are selected 
according to climatic and ecological conditions (FAO 2011). For 
example, such re-vegetation processes have been implemented on 
the shifting dunes of the Tengger Desert in northern China leading 
to the stabilisation of sand and the sequestration of up to 10 tC ha–1 
over a period of 55 years (Yang et al. 2014).
1.6.1.5 
Use of halophytes for the re-vegetation of saline lands
Soil salinity and sodicity can severely limit the growth and productivity 
of crops (Jan et al. 2017) and lead to a decrease in available arable 
land. Leaching and drainage provides a possible solution, but can be 
prohibitively expensive. An alternative, more economical option, is the 
growth of halophytes (plants that are adapted to grow under highly 
saline conditions) that allow saline land to be used in a productive 
manner (Qadir et al. 2000). The biomass produced can be used as 
forage, food, feed, essential oils, biofuel, timber, or fuelwood (Chughtai 
et al. 2015; Mahmood et al. 2016; Sharma et al. 2016). A  further 
co-benefit is the opportunity to mitigate climate change through 
the enhancement of terrestrial carbon stocks as land is re-vegetated 
(Dagar et al. 2014; Wicke et al. 2013). The combined use of salt-tolerant 
crops, improved irrigation practices, chemical remediation measures 
and appropriate mulch and compost is effective in reducing the impact 
of secondary salinisation (medium confidence).
In Pakistan, where about  6.2 Mha of agricultural land is affected 
by salinity, pioneering work on utilising salt-tolerant plants for the 
re-vegetation of saline lands (biosaline agriculture) was done in the 
early 1970s (NIAB 1997). A number of local and exotic varieties were 
initially screened for salt tolerance in lab – and greenhouse-based 
studies, and then distributed to similar saline areas (Ashraf et al. 
2010). These included tree species (Acacia ampliceps, Acacia nilotica, 
Eucalyptus camaldulensis, Prosopis juliflora, Azadirachta indica) 
(Awan and Mahmood 2017), forage plants (Leptochloa fusca, 
Sporobolus arabicus, Brachiaria mutica, Echinochloa sp., Sesbania 
and Atriplex spp.) and crop species including varieties of barley 
(Hordeum vulgare), cotton, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and Brassica 
spp. (Mahmood et al. 2016) as well as fruit crops in the form of 
date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) that has high salt tolerance with no 
visible adverse effects on seedlings (Yaish and Kumar 2015; Al-Mulla 
et al. 2013; Alrasbi et al. 2010). Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) 
is another fruit crop of moderate to high salt tolerance. Through 
regulating growth form and nutrient balancing, it can maintain water 
content, chlorophyll fluorescence and enzyme activity at normal 
levels (Ibrahim 2016; Okhovatian-Ardakani et al. 2010).
In India and elsewhere, tree species including Prosopis juliflora, 
Dalbergia sissoo, and Eucalyptus tereticornis have been used to 
re-vegetate saline land. Certain biofuel crops in the form of Ricinus 
communis (Abideen et al. 2014), Euphorbia antisyphilitica (Dagar 
et al. 2014), Karelinia caspia (Akinshina et al. 2016) and Salicornia 
spp. (Sanandiya and Siddhanta 2014) are grown in saline areas, 
and Panicum turgidum (Koyro et al. 2013) and Leptochloa fusca 
(Akhter et al. 2003) have been grown as fodder crop on degraded 
soils with brackish water. In China, intense efforts are being made 
on the use of halophytes (Sakai et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2018). These 
examples reveal that there is great scope for saline areas to be used 
in a productive manner through the utilisation of halophytes. The 
most productive species often have yields equivalent to conventional 
crops, at salinity levels matching even that of seawater.
1.6.2 
Socio-economic responses 
Socio-economic and policy responses are often crucial in enhancing 
the adoption of SLM practices (Cordingley et al. 2015; Fleskens and 
Stringer 2014; Nyanga et al. 2016) and for assisting agricultural 
households to diversify their sources of income (Barrett et al. 2017; 
Shiferaw and Djido 2016). Technology and socio-economic responses 
are not independent, but continuously interact.
1.6.2.1 
Socio-economic responses for combating 
desertification under climate change 
Desertification limits the choice of potential climate change 
mitigation and adaptation response options by reducing climate 
change adaptive capacities. Furthermore, many additional factors, 
for example, a lack of access to markets or insecurity of land tenure, 
hinder the adoption of SLM. These factors are largely beyond the 
control of individuals or local communities and require broader policy 
interventions (Section 3.6.3). Nevertheless, local collective action and 
ILK are still crucial to the ability of households to respond to the 
284

combined challenge of climate change and desertification. Raising 
awareness, capacity building and development to promote collective 
action and indigenous and local knowledge contribute to avoiding, 
reducing and reversing desertification under changing climate. 
The use of indigenous and local knowledge enhances the 
success of SLM and its ability to address desertification (Altieri and 
Nicholls 2017; Engdawork and Bork 2016). Using indigenous and 
local knowledge for combating desertification could contribute to 
climate change adaptation strategies (Belfer et al. 2017; Codjoe 
et al. 2014; Etchart 2017; Speranza et al. 2010; Makondo and Thomas 
2018; Maldonado et al. 2016; Nyong et al. 2007). There are abundant 
examples of how indigenous and local knowledge,  which are an 
important part of broader agroecological knowledge (Altieri 2018), 
have allowed livelihood systems in drylands to be maintained despite 
environmental constraints. An example is the numerous traditional 
water harvesting techniques that are used across the drylands 
to adapt to dry spells and climate change. These include creating 
planting pits (zai, ngoro) and micro-basins, contouring hill slopes 
and terracing (Biazin et al. 2012) (Section 3.6.1). Traditional ndiva 
water harvesting systems in Tanzania enable the capture of runoff 
water from highland areas to downstream community-managed 
micro-dams for subsequent farm delivery through small-scale 
canal networks (Enfors and Gordon 2008). A  further example are 
pastoralist communities located in drylands who have developed 
numerous methods to sustainably manage rangelands. Pastoralist 
communities in Morocco developed the agdal system of seasonally 
alternating use of rangelands to limit overgrazing (Dominguez 2014) 
as well as to manage forests in the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains 
(Auclair et al. 2011). Across the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa, 
a  rotational grazing system, hema, was historically practiced by 
the Bedouin communities (Hussein 2011; Louhaichi and Tastad 
2010). The Beni-Amer herders in the Horn of Africa have developed 
complex livestock breeding and selection systems (Fre 2018). 
Although well adapted to resource-sparse dryland environments, 
traditional practices are currently not able to cope with increased 
demand for food and environmental changes (Enfors and Gordon 
2008; Engdawork and Bork 2016). Moreover, there is robust evidence 
documenting the marginalisation or loss of indigenous and local 
knowledge (Dominguez 2014; Fernández-Giménez and Fillat Estaque 
2012; Hussein 2011; Kodirekkala 2017; Moreno-Calles et al. 2012). 
Combined use of indigenous and local knowledge and new SLM 
technologies can contribute to raising resilience to the challenges 
of climate change and desertification (high confidence) (Engdawork 
and Bork 2016; Guzman et al. 2018). 
Collective action has the potential to contribute to SLM and climate 
change adaptation (medium confidence) (Adger 2003; Engdawork 
and Bork 2016; Eriksen and Lind 2009; Ostrom 2009; Rodima-Taylor 
et al. 2012). Collective action is a result of social capital. Social capital 
is divided into structural and cognitive forms: structural corresponding 
to strong networks (including outside one’s immediate community); 
and cognitive encompassing mutual trust and cooperation within 
communities (van Rijn et al. 2012; Woolcock and Narayan 2000). 
Social capital is more important for economic growth in settings with 
weak formal institutions, and less so in those with strong enforcement 
of formal institutions (Ahlerup et al. 2009). There are cases throughout 
the drylands showing that community by-laws and collective action 
successfully limited land degradation and facilitated SLM (Ajayi et al. 
2016; Infante 2017; Kassie et al. 2013; Nyangena 2008; Willy and 
Holm-Müller 2013; Wossen et al. 2015). However, there are also cases 
when they did not improve SLM where they were not strictly enforced 
(Teshome et al. 2016). Collective action for implementing responses 
to dryland degradation is often hindered by local asymmetric power 
relations and ‘elite capture’ (Kihiu 2016; Stringer et al. 2007). This 
illustrates that different levels and types of social capital result in 
different levels of collective action. In a sample of East, West and 
southern African countries, structural social capital in the form of 
access to networks outside one’s own community was suggested to 
stimulate the adoption of agricultural innovations, whereas cognitive 
social capital, associated with inward-looking community norms of 
trust and cooperation, was found to have a  negative relationship 
with the adoption of agricultural innovations (van Rijn et al. 2012). 
The latter is indirectly corroborated by observations of the impact of 
community-based rangeland management organisations in Mongolia. 
Although levels of cognitive social capital did not differ between them, 
communities with strong links to outside networks were able to apply 
more innovative rangeland management practices in comparison to 
communities without such links (Ulambayar et al. 2017).
Farmer-led innovations. Agricultural households are not just 
passive adopters of externally developed technologies, but are active 
experimenters and innovators (Reij and Waters-Bayer 2001; Tambo 
and Wünscher 2015; Waters-Bayer et al. 2009). SLM technologies 
co-generated through direct participation of agricultural households 
have higher chances of being accepted by them (medium confidence) 
(Bonney et al. 2016; Vente et al. 2016). Usually farmer-driven 
innovations are more frugal and better adapted to their resource 
scarcities than externally introduced technologies (Gupta et al. 
2016). Farmer-to-farmer sharing of their own innovations and mutual 
learning positively contribute to higher technology adoption rates 
(Dey et al. 2017). This innovative ability can be given a new dynamism 
by combining it with emerging external technologies. For example, 
emerging low-cost phone applications (‘apps’) that are linked to soil 
and water monitoring sensors can provide farmers with previously 
inaccessible information and guidance (Cornell et al. 2013; Herrick 
et al. 2017; McKinley et al. 2017; Steger et al. 2017). 
Currently, the adoption of SLM practices remains insufficient to 
address desertification and contribute to climate change adaptation 
and mitigation more extensively. This is due to the constraints on 
the use of indigenous and local knowledge and collective action, 
as well as economic and institutional barriers for SLM adoption 
(Banadda 2010; Cordingley et al. 2015; Lokonon and Mbaye 2018; 
Mulinge et al. 2016; Wildemeersch et al. 2015) (Section 3.1.4.2; 3.6.3). 
Sustainable development of drylands under these socio-economic and 
environmental (climate change, desertification) conditions will also 
depend on the ability of dryland agricultural households to diversify 
their livelihoods sources (Boserup 1965; Safriel and Adeel 2008).
285

1.6.2.2 
Socio-economic responses for economic diversification
Livelihood diversification through non-farm employment increases 
the resilience of rural households against desertification and extreme 
weather events by diversifying their income and consumption (high 
confidence). Moreover, it can provide the funds to invest into SLM 
(Belay et al. 2017; Bryan et al. 2009; Dumenu and Obeng 2016; 
Salik et al. 2017; Shiferaw et al. 2009). Access to non-agricultural 
employment is especially important for poorer pastoral households 
as their small herd sizes make them less resilient to drought (Fratkin 
2013; Lybbert et al. 2004). However, access to alternative opportunities 
is limited in the rural areas of many developing countries, especially 
for women and marginalised groups who lack education and social 
networks (Reardon et al. 2008).
Migration is frequently used as an adaptation strategy to 
environmental change (medium confidence). Migration is a  form 
of livelihood diversification and a  potential response option to 
desertification and increasing risk to agricultural livelihoods under 
climate change (Walther et al. 2002). Migration can be short-term 
(e.g., seasonal) or long-term, internal within a country or international. 
There is medium evidence showing rural households responding 
to desertification and droughts through all forms of migration, for 
example: during the Dust Bowl in the USA in the 1930s (Hornbeck 
2012); during droughts in Burkina Faso in the 2000s (Barbier et al. 
2009); in Mexico in the 1990s (Nawrotzki et al. 2016); and by the 
Aymara people of the semi-arid Tarapacá region in Chile between 1820 
and 1970, responding to declines in rainfall and growing demands 
for labour outside the region (Lima et al. 2016). There is robust 
evidence and high agreement showing that migration decisions are 
influenced by a complex set of different factors, with desertification 
and climate change playing relatively lesser roles (Liehr et al. 
2016) (Section 3.4.2). Barrios et al. (2006) found that urbanisation 
in Sub-Saharan Africa was partially influenced by climatic factors 
during the 1950–2000 period, in parallel to liberalisation of internal 
restrictions on labour movements: each 1% reduction in rainfall was 
associated with a  0.45% increase in urbanisation. This migration 
favoured more industrially diverse urban areas in Sub-Saharan Africa 
(Henderson et al. 2017), because they offer more diverse employment 
opportunities and higher wages. Similar trends were also observed in 
Iran in response to water scarcity (Madani et al. 2016). 
However, migration involves some initial investments. For this 
reason, reductions in agricultural incomes due to climate change 
or desertification have the potential to decrease out-migration 
among the poorest agricultural households, who become less able 
to afford migration (Cattaneo and Peri 2016), thus increasing social 
inequalities. There is medium evidence and high agreement that 
households with migrant worker members are more resilient against 
extreme weather events and environmental degradation compared 
to non-migrant households, who are more dependent on agricultural 
income (Liehr et al. 2016; Salik et al. 2017; Sikder and Higgins 
2017). Remittances from migrant household members potentially 
contribute to SLM adoptions, however, substantial out-migration was 
also found to constrain the implementation of labour-intensive land 
management practices (Chen et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2016a).
1.6.3 
Policy responses
The adoption of SLM practices depends on the compatibility of 
the technology with prevailing socio-economic and biophysical 
conditions (Sanz et al. 2017). Globally, it was shown that every USD 
invested into restoring degraded lands yields social returns, including 
both provisioning and non-provisioning ecosystem services, in the 
range of  3–6 USD over a  30-year period (Nkonya et al. 2016a). 
A similar range of returns from land restoration activities was found 
in Central Asia (Mirzabaev et al. 2016), Ethiopia (Gebreselassie et al. 
2016), India (Mythili and Goedecke 2016), Kenya (Mulinge et al. 
2016), Niger (Moussa et al. 2016) and Senegal (Sow et al. 2016) 
(medium confidence). Despite these relatively high returns, there 
is robust evidence that the adoption of SLM practices remains low 
(Cordingley et al. 2015; Giger et al. 2015; Lokonon and Mbaye 2018). 
Part of the reason for these low adoption rates is that the major 
share of the returns from SLM are social benefits, namely in the form 
of non-provisioning ecosystem services (Nkonya et al. 2016a). The 
adoption of SLM technologies does not always provide implementers 
with immediate private benefits (Schmidt et al. 2017). High initial 
investment costs, institutional and governance constraints and a lack 
of access to technologies and equipment may inhibit their adoption 
further (Giger et al. 2015; Sanz et al. 2017; Schmidt et al. 2017). 
However, not all SLM practices have high upfront costs. Analysing 
the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies 
(WOCAT) database, a  globally acknowledged reference database 
for SLM, Giger et al. (2015) found that the upfront costs of SLM 
technologies ranged from about 20 USD to 5000 USD, with the 
median cost being around 500 USD. Many SLM technologies are 
profitable within 3 to 10 years (medium confidence) (Djanibekov and 
Khamzina 2016; Giger et al. 2015; Moussa et al. 2016; Sow et al. 
2016). About 73% of 363 SLM technologies evaluated were reported 
to become profitable within three years, while 97% were profitable 
within 10 years (Giger et al. 2015). Similarly, it was shown that social 
returns from investments in restoring degraded lands will exceed 
their costs within six years in many settings across drylands (Nkonya 
et al. 2016a). However, even with affordable upfront costs, market 
failures – in the form of lack of access to credit, input and output 
markets, and insecure land tenure (Section 3.1.3) – result in the lack 
of adoption of SLM technologies (Moussa et al. 2016). Payments 
for ecosystem services, subsidies for SLM, and encouragement of 
community collective action can lead to a higher level of adoption of 
SLM and land restoration activities (medium confidence) (Bouma and 
Wösten 2016; Lambin et al. 2014; Reed et al. 2015; Schiappacasse 
et al. 2012; van Zanten et al. 2014) (Section 3.6.3). Enabling the policy 
responses discussed in this section will contribute to overcoming 
these market failures. 
Many socio-economic factors shaping individual responses to 
desertification typically operate at larger scales. Individual households 
and communities do not exercise control over these factors, such 
as land tenure insecurity, lack of property rights, lack of access to 
markets, availability of rural advisory services, and agricultural price 
distortions. These factors are shaped by national government policies 
and international markets. As is the case with socio-economic 
responses, policy responses are classified below in two ways: those 
which seek to combat desertification under changing climate; and 
286
Chapter 3 
Desertification
3
those which seek to provide alternative livelihood sources through 
economic diversification. These options are mutually complementary 
and contribute to all the three hierarchical elements of the Land 
Degradation Neutrality (LDN) framework, namely, avoiding, reducing 
and reversing land degradation (Cowie et al. 2018; Orr et al. 
2017) (Sections 4.8.5 and 7.4.5, and Table 7.2). An enabling policy 
environment is a critical element for the achievement of LDN (Chasek 
et al. 2019). Implementation of LDN policies can contribute to climate 
change adaptation and mitigation (high confidence) (Sections 3.6.1 
and 3.7.2). 
1.6.3.1 
Policy responses towards combating desertification 
under climate change
Policy responses to combat desertification take numerous forms 
(Marques et al. 2016). Below we discuss major policy responses 
consistently highlighted in the literature in connection with SLM 
and climate change, because these response options were found to 
strengthen adaptation capacities and to contribute to climate change 
mitigation. They include improving market access, empowering 
women, expanding access to agricultural advisory services, 
strengthening land tenure security, payments for ecosystem services, 
decentralised natural resource management, investing into research 
and monitoring of desertification and dust storms, and investing into 
modern renewable energy sources. 
Policies aiming at improving market access, that is the ability 
to access output and input markets at lower costs, help farmers and 
livestock producers earn more profit from their produce. Increased 
profits both motivate and enable them to invest more in SLM. Higher 
access to input, output and credit markets was consistently found as 
a major factor in the adoption of SLM practices in a wide number 
of settings across the drylands (medium confidence) (Aw-Hassan 
et al. 2016; Gebreselassie et al. 2016; Mythili and Goedecke 2016; 
Nkonya and Anderson 2015; Sow et al. 2016). Lack of access to 
credit limits adjustments and agricultural responses to the impacts of 
desertification under changing climate, with long-term consequences 
for the livelihoods and incomes, as was shown during the North 
American Dust Bowl of the 1930s (Hornbeck 2012). Government 
policies aimed at improving market access usually involve 
constructing and upgrading rural–urban transportation infrastructure 
and agricultural value chains, such as investments into construction 
of local markets, abattoirs and cold storage warehouses, as well as 
post-harvest processing facilities (McPeak et al. 2006). However, 
besides infrastructural constraints, providing improved access often 
involves relieving institutional constraints to market access (Little 
2010), such as improved coordination of cross-border food safety 
and veterinary regulations (Ait Hou et al. 2015; Keiichiro et al. 2015; 
McPeak et al. 2006; Unnevehr 2015), and availability and access to 
market information systems (Bobojonov et al. 2016; Christy et al. 
2014; Nakasone et al. 2014).
Women’s empowerment. A  greater emphasis on understanding 
gender-specific differences over land use and land management 
practices as an entry point can make land restoration projects 
more successful (medium confidence) (Broeckhoven and Cliquet 
2015; Carr and Thompson 2014; Catacutan and Villamor 2016; 
Dah-gbeto and Villamor 2016). In relation to representation and 
authority to make decisions in land management and governance, 
women’s participation remains lacking particularly in the dryland 
regions. Thus, ensuring women’s rights means accepting women as 
equal members of the community and citizens of the state (Nelson 
et al. 2015). This includes equitable access of women to resources 
(including extension services), networks, and markets. In areas where 
socio-cultural norms and practices devalue women and undermine 
their participation, actions for empowering women will require 
changes in customary norms, recognition of women’s (land) rights in 
government policies, and programmes to assure that their interests 
are better represented (Section 1.4.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 11 in 
Chapter 7). In addition, several novel concepts are recently applied 
for an in-depth understanding of gender in relation to science–policy 
interface. Among these are the concepts of intersectionality, that 
is, how social dimensions of identity and gender are bound up in 
systems of power and social institutions (Thompson-Hall et al. 
2016), bounded rationality for gendered decision-making, related to 
incomplete information interacting with limits to human cognition 
leading to judgement errors or objectively poor decision making 
(Villamor and van Noordwijk 2016), anticipatory learning for 
preparing for possible contingencies and consideration of long-term 
alternatives (Dah-gbeto and Villamor 2016) and systematic leverage 
points for interventions that produce, mark, and entrench gender 
inequality within communities (Manlosa et al. 2018), which all aim to 
improve gender equality within agroecological landscapes through 
a systems approach.
Education and expanding access to agricultural services. 
Providing access to information about SLM practices facilitates their 
adoption (medium confidence) (Kassie et al. 2015; Nkonya et al. 
2015; Nyanga et al. 2016). Moreover, improving the knowledge of 
climate change, capacity building and development in rural areas can 
help strengthen climate change adaptive capacities (Berman et al. 
2012; Chen et al. 2018; Descheemaeker et al. 2018; Popp et al. 2009; 
Tambo 2016; Yaro et al. 2015). Agricultural initiatives to improve the 
adaptive capacities of vulnerable populations were more successful 
when they were conducted through reorganised social institutions 
and improved communication, for example, in Mozambique (Osbahr 
et al. 2008). Improved communication and education could be 
facilitated by wider use of new information and communication 
technologies (ICTs) (Peters et al. 2015). Investments into education 
were associated with higher adoption of soil conservation measures, 
for example, in Tanzania (Tenge et al. 2004). Bryan et al. (2009) found 
that access to information was the prominent facilitator of climate 
change adaptation in Ethiopia. However, resource constraints of 
agricultural services, and disconnects between agricultural policy 
and climate policy can hinder the dissemination of climate-smart 
agricultural technologies (Morton 2017). Lack of knowledge was 
also found to be a  significant barrier to implementation of soil 
rehabilitation programmes in the Mediterranean region (Reichardt 
2010). Agricultural services will be able to facilitate SLM best 
when they also serve as platforms for sharing indigenous and 
local knowledge and farmer innovations (Mapfumo et al. 2016). 
Participatory research initiatives conducted jointly with farmers have 
higher chances of resulting in technology adoption (Bonney et al. 
2016; Rusike et al. 2006; Vente et al. 2016). Moreover, rural advisory 
287
Desertification 
Chapter 3
3
services are often more successful in disseminating technological 
innovations when they adopt commodity/value chain approaches, 
remain open to engagement in input supply, make use of new 
opportunities presented by ICTs, facilitate mutual learning between 
multiple stakeholders (Morton 2017), and organise science and SLM 
information in a location-specific manner for use in education and 
extension (Bestelmeyer et al. 2017).
Strengthening land tenure security. Strengthening land tenure 
security is a  major factor contributing to the adoption of soil 
conservation measures in croplands (high confidence) (Bambio 
and Bouayad Agha 2018; Higgins et al. 2018; Holden and Ghebru 
2016; Paltasingh 2018; Rao et al. 2016; Robinson et al. 2018), 
thus contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation. 
Moreover, land tenure security can lead to more investment in trees 
(Deininger and Jin 2006; Etongo et al. 2015). Land tenure recognition 
policies were found to lead to higher agricultural productivity and 
incomes, although with inter-regional variations, requiring an 
improved understanding of overlapping formal and informal land 
tenure rights (Lawry et al. 2017). For example, secure land tenure 
increased investments into SLM practices in Ghana, but without 
affecting farm productivity (Abdulai et al. 2011). Secure land tenure, 
especially for communally managed lands, helps reduce arbitrary 
appropriations of land for large-scale commercial farms (Aha and 
Ayitey 2017; Baumgartner 2017; Dell’Angelo et al. 2017). In contrast, 
privatisation of rangeland tenures in Botswana and Kenya led to the 
loss of communal grazing lands and actually increased rangeland 
degradation (Basupi et al. 2017; Kihiu 2016) as pastoralists needed 
to graze livestock on now smaller communal pastures. Since food 
insecurity in drylands is strongly affected by climate risks, there is 
robust evidence and high agreement that resilience to climate risks 
is higher with flexible tenure for allowing mobility for pastoralist 
communities, and not fragmenting their areas of movement (Behnke 
1994; Holden and Ghebru 2016; Liao et al. 2017; Turner et al. 2016; 
Wario et al. 2016). More research is needed on the optimal tenure 
mix, including low-cost land certification, redistribution reforms, 
market-assisted reforms and gender-responsive reforms, as well as 
collective forms of land tenure such as communal land tenure and 
cooperative land tenure (see Section 7.6.5 for a broader discussion of 
land tenure security under climate change). 
Payment for ecosystem services (PES) provides incentives for 
land restoration and SLM (medium confidence) (Lambin et al. 2014; 
Li et al. 2018; Reed et al. 2015; Schiappacasse et al. 2012). Several 
studies illustrate that the social costs of desertification are larger than 
its private cost (Costanza et al. 2014; Nkonya et al. 2016a). Therefore, 
although SLM can generate public goods in the form of provisioning 
ecosystem services, individual land custodians underinvest in SLM as 
they are unable to reap these benefits fully. Payment for ecosystem 
services provides a mechanism through which some of these benefits 
can be transferred to land users, thereby stimulating further investment 
in SLM. The effectiveness of PES schemes depends on land tenure 
security and appropriate design, taking into account specific local 
conditions (Börner et al. 2017). However, PES has not worked well in 
countries with fragile institutions (Karsenty and Ongolo 2012). Equity 
and justice in distributing the payments for ecosystem services were 
found to be key for the success of the PES programmes in Yunnan, 
China (He and Sikor 2015). Yet, when reviewing the performance of 
PES programmes in the tropics, Calvet-Mir et al. (2015), found that 
they are generally effective in terms of environmental outcomes, 
despite being sometimes unfair in terms of payment distribution. It is 
suggested that the implementation of PES will be improved through 
decentralised approaches giving local communities a larger role in 
the decision-making process (He and Lang 2015).
Empowering local communities for decentralised natural 
resource management. Local institutions often play a  vital role 
in implementing SLM initiatives and climate change adaptation 
measures (high confidence) (Gibson et al. 2005; Smucker et al. 
2015). Pastoralists involved in community-based natural resource 
management in Mongolia had greater capacity to adapt to 
extreme winter frosts, resulting in less damage to their livestock 
(Fernandez-Gimenez et al. 2015). Decreasing the power and role of 
traditional community institutions, due to top-down public policies, 
resulted in lower success rates in community-based programmes 
focused on rangeland management in Dirre, Ethiopia (Abdu and 
Robinson 2017). Decentralised governance was found to lead to 
improved management in forested landscapes (Dressler et al. 2010; 
Ostrom and Nagendra 2006). However, there are also cases when 
local elites were placed in control and this decentralised natural 
resource management negatively impacted the livelihoods of the 
poorer and marginalised community members due to reduced access 
to natural resources (Andersson and Ostrom 2008; Cullman 2015; 
Dressler et al. 2010). 
The success of decentralised natural resource management 
initiatives depends on increased participation and empowerment 
of a diverse set of community members, not only local leaders and 
elites, in the design and management of local resource management 
institutions (Kadirbeyoglu and Özertan 2015; Umutoni et al. 2016), 
while considering the interactions between actors and institutions 
at different levels of governance (Andersson and Ostrom 2008; 
Carlisle and Gruby 2017; McCord et al. 2017). An example of such 
programmes where local communities played a major role in land 
restoration and rehabilitation activities is the cooperative project 
on The National Afforestation and Erosion Control Mobilization 
Action Plan in Turkey, initiated by the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture 
and Forestry (Çalişkan and Boydak 2017), with the investment 
of 1.8 billion USD between 2008 and 2012. The project mobilised 
local communities in cooperation with public institutions, 
municipalities, and non-governmental organisations, to implement 
afforestation, rehabilitation and erosion control measures, resulting 
in the afforestation and reforestation of 1.5 Mha (Yurtoglu 2015). 
Moreover, some  1.75 Mha of degraded forest and 37,880 ha of 
degraded rangelands were rehabilitated. Finally, the project provided 
employment opportunities for 300,000 rural residents for six months 
every year, combining land restoration and rehabilitation activities 
with measures to promote socio-economic development in rural 
areas (Çalişkan and Boydak 2017).
Investing in research and development. Desertification has 
received substantial research attention over recent decades (Turner 
et al. 2007). There is also a  growing research interest on climate 
change adaptation and mitigation interventions that help address 
288
Chapter 3 
Desertification
3
desertification (Grainger 2009). Agricultural research on SLM 
practices has generated a significant number of new innovations and 
technologies that increase crop yields without degrading the land, 
while contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation 
(Section 3.6.1). There is robust evidence that such technologies help 
improve the food security of smallholder dryland farming households 
(Harris and Orr 2014) (Section  6.3.5). Strengthening research on 
desertification is of high importance not only to meet SDGs but also to 
manage ecosystems effectively, based on solid scientific knowledge. 
More investment in research institutes and training the younger 
generation of researchers is needed for addressing the combined 
challenges of desertification and climate change (Akhtar-Schuster 
et al. 2011; Verstraete et al. 2011). This includes improved knowledge 
management systems that allow stakeholders to work in a coordinated 
manner by enhancing timely, targeted and contextualised information 
sharing (Chasek et al. 2011). Knowledge and flow of knowledge 
on desertification is currently highly fragmented, constraining the 
effectiveness of those engaged in assessing and monitoring the 
phenomenon at various levels (Reed et al. 2011). Improved knowledge 
and data exchange and sharing increase the effectiveness of efforts to 
address desertification (high confidence). 
Developing modern renewable energy sources. Transitioning to 
renewable energy resources contributes to reducing desertification by 
lowering reliance on traditional biomass in dryland regions (medium 
confidence). This can also have socioeconomic and health benefits, 
especially for women and children (high confidence). Populations in 
most developing countries continue to rely on traditional biomass, 
including fuelwood, crop straws and livestock manure, for a major 
share of their energy needs, with the highest dependence in 
Sub-Saharan Africa (Amugune et al. 2017; IEA 2013). Use of biomass 
for energy, mostly fuelwood (especially as charcoal), was associated 
with deforestation in some dryland areas (Iiyama et al. 2014; Mekuria 
et al. 2018; Neufeldt et al. 2015; Zulu 2010), while in some other areas 
there was no link between fuelwood collection and deforestation 
(Simon and Peterson 2018; Swemmer et al. 2018; Twine and Holdo 
2016). Moreover, the use of traditional biomass as a source of energy 
was found to have negative health effects through indoor air pollution 
(de la Sota et al. 2018; Lim and Seow 2012), while also being associated 
with lower female labour force participation (Burke and Dundas 
2015). Jiang et al. (2014) indicated that providing improved access to 
alternative energy sources such as solar energy and biogas could help 
reduce the use of fuelwood in south-western China, thus alleviating the 
spread of rocky desertification. The conversion of degraded lands into 
cultivation of biofuel crops will affect soil carbon dynamics (Albanito 
et al. 2016; Nair et al. 2011) (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6). The 
use of biogas slurry as soil amendment or fertiliser can increase soil 
carbon (Galvez et al. 2012; Negash et al. 2017). Large-scale installation 
of wind and solar farms in the Sahara Desert was projected to create 
a  positive climate feedback through increased surface friction and 
reduced albedo, doubling precipitation over the neighbouring Sahel 
region with resulting increases in vegetation (Li et al. 2018). Transition 
to renewable energy sources in high-income countries in dryland 
areas primarily contributes to reducing GHG emissions and mitigating 
climate change, with some other co-benefits such as diversification 
of energy sources (Bang 2010), while the impacts on desertification 
are less evident. The use of renewable energy has been proposed 
as an important mitigation option in dryland areas as well (El-Fadel 
et al. 2003). Transitions to renewable energy are being promoted 
by governments across drylands (Cancino-Solórzano et al. 2016; 
Hong  et al. 2013; Sen and Ganguly 2017) including in fossil-fuel 
rich countries (Farnoosh et al. 2014; Dehkordi et al. 2017; Stambouli 
et al. 2012; Vidadili et al. 2017), despite important social, political 
and technical barriers to expanding renewable energy production 
(Afsharzade et al.  2016; Baker et al. 2014; Elum and Momodu 
2017; Karatayev et al. 2016). Improving social awareness about the 
benefits of transitioning to renewable energy resources, and access 
to hydro-energy, solar and wind energy contributes to their improved 
adoption (Aliyu et al. 2017; Katikiro 2016). 
Developing and strengthening climate services relevant 
for desertification. Climate services provide climate, drought 
and desertification-related information in a  way that assists 
decision-making by individuals and organisations. Monitoring 
desertification, and integrating biogeophysical (climate, soil, 
ecological factors, biodiversity) and socio-economic (use of natural 
resources by local population) issues provide a  basis for better 
vulnerability prediction and assessment (OSS, 2012; Vogt et al. 2011). 
Examples of relevant services include: drought monitoring and 
early warning systems, often implemented by national climate and 
meteorological services but also encompassing regional and global 
systems (Pozzi et al. 2013); and the Sand and Dust Storm Warning 
Advisory and Assessment System (SDS-WAS), created by WMO in 
2007, in partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) and 
the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Currently, there 
is also a lack of ecological monitoring in arid and semi-arid regions 
to study surface winds, dust and sand storms, and their impacts on 
ecosystems and human health (Bergametti et al. 2018; Marticorena 
et al. 2010). Reliable and timely climate services, relevant to 
desertification, can aid the development of appropriate adaptation 
and mitigation options, reducing the impact of desertification under 
changing climate on human and natural systems (high confidence) 
(Beegum et al. 2016; Beegum et al. 2018; Cornet 2012; Haase et al. 
2018; Sergeant et al. 2012).
1.6.3.2 
Policy responses supporting economic diversification
Despite policy responses for combating desertification, other factors 
will put strong pressures on the land, including climate change 
and growing food demands, as well as the need to reduce poverty 
and strengthen food security (Cherlet et al. 2018) (Sections  6.1.4 
and 7.2.2). Sustainable development of drylands and their resilience 
to combined challenges of desertification and climate change will 
thus also depend on the ability of governments to promote policies 
for economic diversification within agriculture and in non-agricultural 
sectors in order make dryland areas less vulnerable to desertification 
and climate change. 
Investing into irrigation. Investments into expanding irrigation 
in dryland areas can help increase the resilience of agricultural 
production to climate change, improve labour productivity and 
boost production and income revenue from agriculture and livestock 
sectors (Geerts and Raes 2009; Olayide et al. 2016; Oweis and 
Hachum 2006). This is particularly true for Sub-Saharan Africa, where 
289
Desertification 
Chapter 3

currently only 6% of the cultivated areas are irrigated (Nkonya et al. 
2016b). While renewable groundwater resources could help increase 
the share of irrigated land to 20.5–48.6% of croplands in the region 
(Altchenko and Villholth 2015). On the other hand, over-extraction of 
groundwaters, mainly for irrigating crops, is becoming an important 
environmental problem in many dryland areas (Cherlet et al. 2018), 
requiring careful design and planning of irrigation expansion schemes 
and use of water-efficient irrigation methods (Bjornlund et al. 2017; 
Woodhouse et al. 2017). For example, in Saudi Arabia, improving 
the efficiency of water management, for example through the 
development of aquifers, water recycling and rainwater harvesting, 
is part of a suite of policy actions to combat desertification (Bazza, 
et al. 2018; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 2016). The expansion of 
irrigation to riverine areas, crucial for dry season grazing of livestock, 
needs to consider the income from pastoral activities, which is not 
always lower than income from irrigated crop production (Behnke 
and Kerven 2013). Irrigation development could be combined with 
the deployment of clean-energy technologies in economically viable 
ways (Chandel et al. 2015). For example, solar-powered drip irrigation 
was found to increase household agricultural incomes in Benin 
(Burney et al. 2010). The sustainability of irrigation schemes based 
on solar-powered extraction of groundwaters depends on measures 
to avoid over-abstraction of groundwater resources and associated 
negative environmental impacts (Closas and Rap 2017). 
Expanding agricultural commercialisation. Faster poverty rate 
reduction and economic growth enhancement is realised when countries 
transition into the production of non-staple, high-value commodities 
and manage to build a robust agro-industry sector (Barrett et al. 2017). 
Ogutu and Qaim (2019) found that agricultural commercialisation 
increased incomes and decreased multidimensional poverty in Kenya. 
Similar findings were earlier reported by Muriithi and Matz (2015) for 
commercialisation of vegetables in Kenya. Commercialisation of rice 
production was found to have increased smallholder welfare in Nigeria 
(Awotide et al. 2016). Agricultural commercialisation contributed to 
improved household food security in Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda 
(Carletto et al. 2017). However, such a  transition did not improve 
farmers’ livelihoods in all cases (Reardon et al. 2009). High-value 
cash crop/animal production can be bolstered by wide-scale use of 
technologies, for example, mechanisation, application of inorganic 
fertilisers, crop protection and animal health products. Market oriented 
crop/animal production facilitates social and economic progress, with 
labour increasingly shifting out of agriculture into non-agricultural 
sectors (Cour 2001). Modernised farming, improved access to inputs, 
credit and technologies enhances competitiveness in local and 
international markets (Reardon et al. 2009).
Facilitating structural transformations in rural economies 
implies that the development of non-agricultural sectors encourages 
the movement of labour from land-based livelihoods, vulnerable to 
desertification and climate change, to non-agricultural activities 
(Haggblade et al. 2010). The movement of labour from agriculture to 
non-agricultural sectors is determined by relative labour productivities 
in these sectors (Shiferaw and Djido 2016). Given already high 
underemployment in the farm sector, increasing labour productivity 
in the non-farm sector was found as the main driver of labour 
movements from farm sector to non-farm sector (Shiferaw and Djido 
2016). More investments into education can facilitate this process 
(Headey et al. 2014). However, in some contexts, such as pastoralist 
communities in Xinjiang, China, income diversification was not found 
to improve the welfare of pastoral households (Liao et al. 2015). 
Economic transformations also occur through urbanisation, involving 
the shift of labour from rural areas into gainful employment in urban 
areas (Jedwab and Vollrath 2015). The majority of world population 
will be living in urban centres in the 21st century and this will require 
innovative means of agricultural production with minimum ecological 
footprint and less dependence on fossil fuels (Revi and Rosenzweig 
2013), while addressing the demand of cities (see Section 4.9.1 for 
discussion on urban green infrastructure). Although there is some 
evidence of urbanisation leading to the loss of indigenous and local 
ecological knowledge,  however, indigenous and local knowledge 
systems are constantly evolving, and are also being integrated into 
urban environments (Júnior et al. 2016; Reyes-García et al. 2013; van 
Andel and Carvalheiro 2013). Urban areas are attracting an increasing 
number of rural residents across the developing world (Angel et al. 
2011; Cour 2001; Dahiya 2012). Urban development contributes to 
expedited agricultural commercialisation by providing market outlet 
for cash crops, high-value crops, and livestock products. At the same 
time, urbanisation also poses numerous challenges in the form of 
rapid urban sprawl and pressures on infrastructure and public services, 
unemployment and associated social risks, which have considerable 
implications on climate change adaptive capacities (Bulkeley 2013; 
Garschagen and Romero-Lankao 2015).

Drought is a highly complex natural hazard (for floods, see Box 7.2). It is difficult to precisely identify its start and end. It is usually slow 
and gradual (Wilhite and Pulwarty 2017), but sometimes can evolve rapidly (Ford and Labosier 2017; Mo and Lettenmaier 2015). It is 
context-dependent, but its impacts are diffuse, both direct and indirect, short-term and long-term (Few and Tebboth 2018; Wilhite and 
Pulwarty 2017). Following the Synthesis Report (SYR) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), drought is defined here as “a period 
of abnormally dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance” (Mach et al. 2014). Although drought is considered 
abnormal relative to the water availability under the mean climatic characteristics, it is also a recurrent element of any climate, not 
only in drylands, but also in humid areas (Cook et al. 2014b; Seneviratne and Ciais 2017; Spinoni et al. 2019; Türkeş 1999; Wilhite et al. 
2014). Climate change is projected to increase the intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions across the world (for a detailed 
assessment see Section 2.2, and IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018)). Droughts often 
amplify the effects of unsustainable land management practices, especially in drylands, leading to land degradation (Cook et al. 2009; 
Hornbeck 2012). Especially in the context of climate change, the recurrent nature of droughts requires proactively planned policy 
instruments both to be well-prepared to respond to droughts when they occur and also undertake ex ante actions to mitigate their 
impacts by strengthening societal resilience against droughts (Gerber and Mirzabaev 2017). 
Droughts are among the costliest of natural hazards (robust evidence, high agreement). According to the International Disaster 
Database (EM-DAT), droughts affected more than 1.1 billion people between 1994 and 2013, with the recorded global economic 
damage of 787 billion USD (CRED 2015), corresponding to an average of 41.4 billion USD per year. Drought losses in the agricultural 
sector alone in developing countries were estimated to equal 29 billion USD between 2005 and 2015 (FAO 2018). Usually, these 
estimates capture only direct and on-site costs of droughts. However, droughts have also wide-ranging indirect and off-site impacts, 
which are seldom quantified. These indirect impacts are both biophysical and socio-economic, with poor households and communities 
being particularly exposed to them (Winsemius et al. 2018). Droughts affect not only water quantity, but also water quality (Mosley 
2014). The costs of these water quality impacts are yet to be adequately quantified. Socio-economic indirect impacts of droughts 
are related to food insecurity, poverty, lowered health and displacement (Gray and Mueller 2012; Johnstone and Mazo 2011; Linke 
et al. 2015; Lohmann and Lechtenfeld 2015; Maystadt and Ecker 2014; Yusa et al. 2015) (Section 3.4.2.9 and Box 5.5), which are 
difficult to quantify comprehensively. Research is required for developing methodologies that could allow for more comprehensive 
assessment of these indirect drought costs. Such methodologies require the collection of highly granular data, which is currently 
lacking in many countries due to high costs of data collection. However, the opportunities provided by remotely sensed data and 
novel analytical methods based on big data and artificial intelligence, including use of citizen science for data collection, could help 
in reducing these gaps. 
There are three broad (and sometimes overlapping) policy approaches for responding to droughts (Section 7.4.8). These approaches 
are often pursued simultaneously by many governments. Firstly, responding to drought when it occurs by providing direct drought 
relief, known as crisis management. Crisis management is also the costliest among policy approaches to droughts because it often 
incentivises the continuation of activities vulnerable to droughts (Botterill and Hayes 2012; Gerber and Mirzabaev 2017).
The second approach involves development of drought preparedness plans, which coordinate the policies for providing relief measures 
when droughts occur. For example, combining resources to respond to droughts at regional level in Sub-Saharan Africa was found to 
be more cost-effective than separate individual country drought relief funding (Clarke and Hill 2013). Effective drought preparedness 
plans require well-coordinated and integrated government actions – a key lesson learnt from 2015 to 2017 during drought response 
in Cape Town, South Africa (Visser 2018). Reliable, relevant and timely climate and weather information helps respond to droughts 
appropriately (Sivakumar and Ndiang’ui 2007). Improved knowledge and integration of weather and climate information can be 
achieved by strengthening drought early warning systems at different scales (Verbist et al. 2016). Every USD invested into strengthening 
hydro-meteorological and early warning services in developing countries was found to yield between 4 and 35 USD (Hallegatte 
2012). Improved access and coverage by drought insurance, including index insurance, can help alleviate the impacts of droughts on 
livelihoods (Guerrero-Baena et al. 2019; Kath et al. 2019; Osgood et al. 2018; Ruiz et al. 2015; Tadesse et al. 2015). 
The third category of responses to droughts involves drought risk mitigation. Drought risk mitigation is a set of proactive measures, 
policies and management activities aimed at reducing the future impacts of droughts (Vicente-Serrano et al. 2012). For example,

1.6.4 
Limits to adaptation, maladaptation,  
and barriers for mitigation
Chapter 16 in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (Klein et al. 
2015) discusses the existence of soft and hard limits to adaptation, 
highlighting that values and perspectives of involved agents 
are relevant to identify limits (Sections 4.8.5.1 and 7.4.9). In that 
sense, adaptation limits vary from place to place and are difficult to 
generalise (Barnett et al. 2015; Dow et al. 2013; Klein et al. 2015). 
Currently, there is a  lack of knowledge on adaptation limits and 
potential maladaptation to combined effects of climate change 
and desertification (see Section  4.8.6 for discussion on resilience, 
thresholds, and irreversible land degradation, also relevant for 
desertification). However, the potential for residual risks (those 
risks which remain after adaptation efforts were taken, irrespective 
of whether they are tolerable or not, tolerability being a subjective 
concept) and maladaptive outcomes is high (high confidence). 
Some examples of residual risks are illustrated below in this section. 
Although SLM measures can help lessen the effects of droughts, 
they cannot fully prevent water stress in crops and resulting lower 
yields (Eekhout and de Vente 2019). Moreover, although in many 
cases SLM measures can help reduce and reverse desertification, 
there would still be short-term losses in land productivity. Irreversible 
forms of land degradation (for example, loss of topsoil, severe 
gully erosion) can lead to the complete loss of land productivity. 
Even when solutions are available, their costs could be prohibitive, 
presenting the limits to adaptation (Dixon et al. 2013). If warming 
in dryland areas surpasses human thermal physiological thresholds 
(Klein et al. 2015; Waha et al. 2013), adaptation could eventually fail 
(Kamali et al. 2018). Catastrophic shifts in ecosystem functions and 
services (for example coastal erosion (Chen et al. 2015; Schneider 
and Kéfi 2016) (Section 4.9.8)) and economic factors can also result 
in adaptation failure (Evans et al. 2015). Despite the availability of 
numerous options that contribute to combating desertification, 
climate change adaptation and mitigation, there are also chances 
of maladaptive actions (medium confidence) (see Glossary). Some 
activities favouring agricultural intensification in dryland areas 
can become maladaptive due to their negative impacts on the 
environment (medium confidence). Agricultural expansion to meet 
food demands can come through deforestation and consequent 
diminution of carbon sinks (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Stringer 
et al. 2012). Agricultural insurance programmes encouraging higher 
agricultural productivity and measures for agricultural intensification 
can result in detrimental environmental outcomes in some settings 
(Guodaar et al. 2019; Müller et al. 2017) (Table 6.12). Development 
of more drought-tolerant crop varieties is considered as a strategy 
for adaptation to shortening rainy seasons, but this can also lead 
to a  loss of local varieties (Al Hamndou and Requier-Desjardins 
Cross-Chapter Box 5 (continued)
policies aimed at improving water use efficiency in different sectors of the economy, especially in agriculture and industry, or 
public advocacy campaigns raising societal awareness and bringing about behavioural change to reduce wasteful water consumption 
in the residential sector are among such drought risk mitigation policies (Tsakiris 2017). Public outreach and monitoring of 
communicable diseases, air and water quality were found to be useful for reducing health impacts of droughts (Yusa et al. 2015). The 
evidence from household responses to drought in Cape Town, South Africa, between 2015 and 2017, suggests that media coverage 
and social media could play a decisive role in changing water consumption behaviour, even more so than official water consumption 
restrictions (Booysen et al. 2019). Drought risk mitigation approaches are less costly than providing drought relief after the occurrence 
of droughts. To illustrate, Harou et al. (2010) found that establishment of water markets in California considerably reduced drought 
costs. Application of water saving technologies reduced drought costs in Iran by 282 million USD (Salami et al. 2009). Booker et al. 
(2005) calculated that inter-regional trade in water could reduce drought costs by 20–30% in the Rio Grande basin, USA. Increasing 
rainfall variability under climate change can make the forms of index insurance based on rainfall less efficient (Kath et al. 2019). 
A number of diverse water property instruments, including instruments allowing water transfer, together with the technological 
and institutional ability to adjust water allocation, can improve timely adjustment to droughts (Hurlbert 2018). Supply-side water 
management, providing for proportionate reductions in water delivery, prevents the important climate change adaptation option 
of managing water according to need or demand (Hurlbert and Mussetta 2016). Exclusive use of a water market to govern water 
allocation similarly prevents the recognition of the human right to water at times of drought (Hurlbert 2018). Policies aiming to secure 
land tenure, and to expand access to markets, agricultural advisory services and effective climate services, as well as to create off-farm 
employment opportunities, can facilitate the adoption of drought risk mitigation practices (Alam 2015; Kusunose and Lybbert 2014), 
increasing resilience to climate change (Section 3.6.3), while also contributing to SLM (Sections 3.6.3 and 4.8.1, and Table 5.7).
The excessive burden of drought relief funding on public budgets is already leading to a paradigm shift towards proactive drought risk 
mitigation instead of reactive drought relief measures (Verner et al. 2018; Wilhite 2016). Climate change will reinforce the need for 
such proactive drought risk mitigation approaches. Policies for drought risk mitigation that are already needed now will be even more 
relevant under higher warming levels (Jerneck and Olsson 2008; McLeman 2013; Wilhite et al. 2014). Overall, there is high confidence 
that responding to droughts through ex post drought relief measures is less efficient compared to ex ante investments into drought 
risk mitigation, particularly under climate change.

2008). Livelihood diversification to collecting and selling firewood 
and charcoal production can exacerbate deforestation (Antwi-Agyei 
et al. 2018). Avoiding maladaptive outcomes can often contribute 
both to reducing the risks from climate change and combating 
desertification (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018). Avoiding, reducing and 
reversing desertification would enhance soil fertility, increase carbon 
storage in soils and biomass, thus reducing carbon emissions from 
soils to the atmosphere (Section 3.7.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 2 in 
Chapter  1). In specific locations, there may be barriers for some 
of these activities. For example, afforestation and reforestation 
programmes can contribute to reducing sand storms and increasing 
carbon sinks in dryland regions (Chu et al. 2019) (Sections  3.6.1 
and  3.7.2). However, implementing agroforestry measures in arid 
locations can be constrained by lack of water (Apuri et al. 2018), 
leading to a trade-off between soil carbon sequestration and other 
water uses (Cao et al. 2018). Thus, even when solutions are available, 
social, economic and institutional constraints could post barriers to 
their implementation (medium confidence). 
1.7 
Hotspots and case studies
The challenges of desertification and climate change in dryland areas 
across the world often have very location-specific characteristics. The 
five case studies in this section present rich experiences and lessons 
learnt on: (i) soil erosion, (ii) afforestation and reforestation through 
‘green walls’, (iii) invasive plant species, (iv) oases in hyper-arid areas, 
and (v) integrated watershed management. Although it is impossible 
to cover all hotspots of desertification and on-the-ground actions 
from all dryland areas, these case studies present a more focused 
assessment of these five issues, which emerged as salient in the 
group discussions and several rounds of review of this chapter. The 
choice of these case studies was also motivated by the desire to 
capture a wide diversity of dryland settings. 
1.7.1 
Climate change and soil erosion
1.7.1.1 
Soil erosion under changing climate in drylands 
Soil erosion is a major form of desertification occurring in varying 
degrees in all dryland areas across the world (Section  3.2), with 
negative effects on dryland ecosystems (Section 3.4). Climate change 
is projected to increase soil erosion potential in some dryland areas 
through more frequent heavy rainfall events and rainfall variability 
(see Section  3.5.2 for a  more detailed assessment) (Achite and 
Ouillon 2007; Megnounif and Ghenim 2016; Vachtman et al. 2013; 
Zhang and Nearing 2005). There are numerous soil conservation 
measures that can help reduce soil erosion (Section  3.6.1). Such 
soil management measures include afforestation and reforestation 
activities, rehabilitation of degraded forests, erosion control 
measures, prevention of overgrazing, diversification of crop rotations, 
and improvement in irrigation techniques, especially in sloping areas 
(Anache et al. 2018; ÇEMGM 2017; Li and Fang 2016; Poesen 2018; 
Ziadat and Taimeh 2013). Effective measures for soil conservation 
can also use spatial patterns of plant cover to reduce sediment 
connectivity, and the relationships between hillslopes and sediment 
transfer in eroded channels (García-Ruiz et al. 2017). The following 
three examples present lessons learnt from the soil erosion problems 
and measures to address them in different settings of Chile, Turkey 
and the Central Asian countries.
1.7.1.2 
No-till practices for reducing soil erosion  
in central Chile
Soil erosion by water is an important problem in Chile. National 
assessments conducted in 1979, which examined 46% of the 
continental surface of the country, concluded that very high levels 
of soil erosion affected 36% of the territory. The degree of soil 
erosion increases from south to north. The leading locations in Chile 
are the region of Coquimbo with 84% of eroded soils (Lat. 29°S, 
semi-arid climate), the region of Valparaíso with 57% of eroded soils 
(Lat. 33°S, Mediterranean climate) and the region of O’Higgins with 
37% of eroded soils (Lat. 34°S, Mediterranean climate). The most 
important drivers of soil erosion are soil, slope, climate erosivity 
(i.e., precipitation, intensity, duration and frequency) due to a highly 
concentrated rainy season, and vegetation structure and cover. In the 
region of Coquimbo, goat and sheep overgrazing have aggravated 
the situation (CIREN 2010). Erosion rates reach up to 100 t  ha–1 
annually, having increased substantially over the last 50 years 
(Ellies 2000). About 10.4% of central Chile exhibits high erosion rates 
(greater than 1.1 t ha–1 annually) (Bonilla et al. 2010).
Over the last few decades there has been an increasing interest in 
the development of no-till (also called zero tillage) technologies to 
minimise soil disturbance, reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and 
increase soil organic matter. No-till, in conjunction with the adoption 
of strategic cover crops, has positively impacted soil biology with 
increases in soil organic matter. Early evaluations by Crovetto, (1998) 
showed that no-till application (after seven years) had doubled the 
biological activity indicators compared to traditional farming and 
even surpassed those found in pasture (grown for the previous 
15 years). Besides erosion control, additional benefits are an increase 
of water-holding capacity and reduction in bulk density. Currently, the 
above no-till farm experiment has lasted for 40 years and continues 
to report benefits to soil health and sustainable production (Reicosky 
and Crovetto 2014). The influence of this iconic farm has resulted in 
the adoption of soil conservation practices – and especially no-till – 
in dryland areas of the Mediterranean climate region of central Chile 
(Martínez et al. 2011). Currently, it has been estimated that the area 
under no-till farming in Chile varies between  0.13 and  0.2 Mha 
(Acevedo and Silva 2003).
1.7.1.3 
Combating wind erosion and deflation in Turkey: 
The greening desert of Karapınar
In Turkey, the amount of sediment recently released through erosion 
into seas was estimated to be 168 Mt yr–1, which is considerably 
lower than the 500 Mt yr–1 that was estimated to be lost in the 
1970s. The decrease in erosion rates is attributed to an increase in 
spatial extent of forests, rehabilitation of degraded forests, erosion 
control, prevention of overgrazing, and improvement in irrigation 
technologies. Soil conservation measures conducted in the Karapınar 
district, Turkey, exemplify these activities. The district is characterised

by a  semi-arid climate and annual average precipitation of 
250–300 mm (Türkeş 2003; Türkeş and Tatlı 2011). In areas where 
vegetation was overgrazed or inappropriately tilled, the surface 
soil horizon was removed through erosion processes resulting in 
the creation of large drifting dunes that threatened settlements 
around Karapınar (Groneman 1968). Such dune movement had 
begun to affect the Karapınar settlement in 1956 (Kantarcı et al. 
2011). Consequently, by the early 1960s, Karapınar town and nearby 
villages were confronted with the danger of abandonment due to 
out-migration in the early 1960s (Figure  3.11(1)). The reasons for 
increasing wind erosion in the Karapınar district can be summarised 
as follows: sandy material was mobilised following drying of the lake; 
hot and semi-arid climate conditions; overgrazing and use of pasture 
plants for fuel; excessive tillage; and strong prevailing winds.
Restoration and mitigation strategies were initiated in 1959, and 
today 4300 ha of land have been restored (Akay and Yildirim 2010) 
(Figure  3.11 (2)), using specific measures: (i) physical measures: 
construction of cane screens to decrease wind speed and prevent 
sand movement (Figure 3.11(3)); (ii) restoration of cover: increasing 
grass cover between screens using seeds collected from local 
pastures or the cultivation of rye (Secale sp.) and wheat grass 
(Agropyron elongatum) that are known to grow in arid and hot 
conditions; and (iii)  afforestation: saplings obtained from nursery 
gardens were planted and grown between these screens. Main 
tree species selected were oleaster (Eleagnus sp.), acacia (Robinia 
pseudeaccacia), ash (Fraxinus sp.), elm (Ulmus sp.) and maple (Acer 
sp.) (Figure  3.11 (4)). Economic growth occurred after controlling 
erosion and new tree nurseries have been established with modern 
irrigation. Potential negative consequences through the excessive 
use of water can be mitigated through engagement with local 
stakeholders and transdisciplinary learning processes, as well as 
by restoring the traditional land uses in the semi-arid Konya closed 
basin (Akça et al. 2016).
1.7.1.4 
Soil erosion in Central Asia under changing climate
Soil erosion is widely acknowledged to be a major form of degradation 
of Central Asian drylands, affecting a considerable share of croplands 
and rangelands. However, up-to-date information on the actual 
extent of eroded soils at the regional or country level is not available. 
The estimates compiled by Pender et al. (2009), based on the 
Central Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management (CACILM), 
indicate that about 0.8 Mha of the irrigated croplands were subject 
to high degree of soil erosion in Uzbekistan. In Turkmenistan, soil 
erosion was indicated to be occurring in about 0.7 Mha of irrigated 
land. In Kyrgyzstan, out of 1 Mha of irrigated land in the foothill 
zones, 0.76 Mha were subject to soil erosion by water, leading to 
losses in crop yields of 20–60% in these eroded soils. About 0.65 Mha 
of arable land were prone to soil erosion by wind (Mavlyanova et al. 
2017). Soil erosion is widespread in rainfed and irrigated areas in 
Kazakhstan (Saparov 2014). About 5 Mha of rainfed croplands were 
subject to high levels of soil erosion (Pender et al. 2009). Soil erosion 
by water was indicated to be a major concern in sloping areas in 
Tajikistan (Pender et al. 2009).
The major causes of soil erosion in Central Asia are related to human 
factors, primarily excessive water use in irrigated areas (Gupta et al. 
2009), deep ploughing and lack of maintenance of vegetative cover in 
rainfed areas (Suleimenov et al. 2014), and overgrazing in rangelands 
(Mirzabaev et al. 2016). Lack of good maintenance of watering 
infrastructure for migratory livestock grazing, and fragmentation of 
livestock herds led to overgrazing near villages, increasing the soil 
erosion by wind (Alimaev et al. 2008). Overgrazing in the rangeland 
areas of the region (e.g.,  particularly in Kyzylkum) contributes to 
dust storms, coming primarily from the Ustyurt Plateau, desertified 
areas of Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers’ deltas, the dried seabed of 
the Aral Sea (now called Aralkum), and the Caspian Sea (Issanova 
and Abuduwaili 2017; Xi and Sokolik 2015). Xi and Sokolik (2015) 
estimated that total dust emissions in Central Asia were 255.6 Mt in 
2001, representing 10–17% of the global total.

Central Asia is one of the regions highly exposed to climate change, 
with warming levels projected to be higher than the global mean 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), leading to more heat extremes (Reyer 
et al. 2017). There is no clear trend in precipitation extremes, with 
some potential for moderate rise in occurrence of droughts. The 
diminution of glaciers is projected to continue in the Pamir and Tian 
Shan mountain ranges, a major source of surface waters along with 
seasonal snowmelt. Glacier melting will increase the hazards from 
moraine-dammed glacial lakes and spring floods (Reyer et al. 2017). 
Increased intensity of spring floods creates favourable conditions 
for higher soil erosion by water, especially in the sloping areas in 
Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The continuation of some of the current 
unsustainable cropland and rangeland management practices may 
lead to elevated rates of soil erosion, particularly in those parts of the 
region where climate change projections point to increases in floods 
(Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan) or increases in droughts (Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan) (Hijioka et al. 2014). Increasing water use to compensate 
for higher evapotranspiration due to rising temperatures and heat 
waves could increase soil erosion by water in the irrigated zones, 
especially in sloping areas and crop fields with uneven land levelling 
(Bekchanov et al. 2010). The desiccation of the Aral Sea resulted in 
a hotter and drier regional microclimate, adding to the growing wind 
erosion in adjacent deltaic areas and deserts (Kust 1999). 
There are numerous sustainable land and water management  
practices available in the region for reducing soil erosion (Abdullaev 
et al. 2007; Gupta et al. 2009; Kust et al. 2014; Nurbekov et al. 2016). 
These include: improved land levelling and more efficient irrigation 
methods such as drip, sprinkler and alternate furrow irrigation 
(Gupta et al. 2009); conservation agriculture practices, including 
no-till methods and maintenance of crop residues as mulch in the 
rainfed and irrigated areas (Kienzler et al. 2012; Pulatov et al. 2012); 
rotational grazing; institutional arrangements for pooling livestock 
for long-distance mobile grazing; reconstruction of watering 
infrastructure along the livestock migratory routes (Han et al. 
2016; Mirzabaev et al. 2016); afforesting degraded marginal lands 
(Djanibekov and Khamzina 2016; Khamzina et al. 2009; Khamzina 
et al. 2016); integrated water resource management (Dukhovny et al. 
2013; Kazbekov et al. 2009); and planting salt – and drought-tolerant 
halophytic plants as windbreaks in sandy rangelands (Akinshina et al. 
2016; Qadir et al. 2009; Toderich et al. 2009; Toderich et al. 2008), 
and potentially the dried seabed of the former Aral Sea (Breckle 
2013). The adoption of enabling policies, such as those discussed in 
Section 3.6.3, can facilitate the adoption of these sustainable land 
and water management practices in Central Asia (high confidence) 
(Aw-Hassan et al. 2016; Bekchanov et al. 2016; Bobojonov et al. 2013; 
Djanibekov et al. 2016; Hamidov et al. 2016; Mirzabaev et al. 2016). 
1.7.2 
Green walls and green dams
This case study evaluates the experiences of measures and actions 
implemented to combat soil erosion, decrease dust storms, and 
to adapt to and mitigate climate change under the Green Wall 
and Green Dam programmes in East Asia (e.g., China) and Africa 
(e.g., Algeria, Sahara and the Sahel region). These measures have 
also been implemented in other countries, such as Mongolia (Do and 
Kang 2014; Lin et al. 2009), Turkey (Yurtoglu 2015; Çalişkan and 
Boydak 2017) and Iran (Amiraslani and Dragovich 2011), and are 
increasingly considered as part of many national and international 
initiatives to combat desertification (Goffner et al. 2019) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). Afforestation and reforestation 
programmes can contribute to reducing sand storms and increasing 
carbon sinks in dryland regions (high confidence). On the other hand, 
green wall and green dam programmes also decrease the albedo 
and hence increase the surface absorption of radiation, increasing 
the surface temperature. The net effect will largely depend on the 
balance between these and will vary from place to place depending 
on many factors. 
1.7.2.1 
The experiences of combating desertification in China
Arid and semi-arid areas of China, including north-eastern, northern 
and north-western regions, cover an area of more than 509 Mha, with 
annual rainfall of below 450 mm. Over the past several centuries, 
more than 60% of the areas in arid and semi-arid regions were used 
as pastoral and agricultural lands. The coupled impacts of past climate 
change and human activity have caused desertification and dust 
storms to become a serious problem in the region (Xu et al. 2010). 
In 1958, the Chinese government recognised that desertification 
and dust storms jeopardised the livelihoods of nearly 200  million 
people, and afforestation programmes for combating desertification 
have been initiated since 1978. China is committed to go beyond the 
Land Degradation Neutrality objective, as indicated by the following 
programmes that have been implemented. The Chinese Government 
began the Three North’s Forest Shelterbelt programme in Northeast 
China, North China, and Northwest China, with the goal to combat 
desertification and to control dust storms by improving forest cover 
in arid and semi-arid regions. The project is implemented in three 
stages (1978–2000, 2001–2020 and 2021–2050). In addition, the 
Chinese government launched the Beijing and Tianjin Sandstorm 
Source Treatment Project (2001–2010), Returning Farmlands to Forest 
Project (2003–present), and the Returning Grazing Land to Grassland 
Project (2003–present) to combat desertification, and for adaptation 
and mitigation of climate change (State Forestry Administration of 
China 2015; Wang 2014; Wang et al. 2013).
The results of the fifth monitoring period (2010–2014) showed: 
(i) compared with 2009, the area of degraded land decreased by 
12,120 km2 over a five-year period; (ii) in 2014, the average coverage 
of vegetation in the sand area was 18.33%, an increase of 0.7% 
compared with 17.63% in 2009, and the carbon sequestration 
increased by 8.5%; (iii) compared with 2009, the amount of wind 
erosion decreased by 33%, the average annual occurrence of 
sandstorms decreased by 20.3% in 2014; (iv) as of 2014, 203,700 km2 
of degraded land were effectively managed, accounting for 38.4% of 
the 530,000 km2 of manageable desertified land; (v) the restoration of 
degraded land has created an annual output of 53.63 Mt of fresh and 
dried fruits, accounting for 33.9% of the total national annual output 
of fresh and dried fruits (State Forestry Administration of China 2015). 
This has become an important pillar for economic development and 
a high priority for peasants as a method to eradicate poverty (State 
Forestry Administration of China 2015).

Stable investment mechanisms for combating desertification have 
been established along with tax relief policies and financial support 
policies for guiding the country in its fight against desertification. The 
investments in scientific and technological innovation for combating 
desertification have been improved, the technologies for vegetation 
restoration under drought conditions have been developed, the 
popularisation and application of new technologies has been 
accelerated, and the training of technicians to assist farmers and 
herdsmen has been strengthened. To improve the monitoring 
capability and technical level of desertification studies, the monitoring 
network system has been strengthened, and the popularisation 
and application of modern technologies have been intensified 
(e.g., information technology and remote sensing) (Wu et al. 2015). 
Special laws on combating desertification have been decreed by 
the government. The provincial government’s responsibilities for 
desertification prevention and controlling objectives and laws have 
been strictly implemented. 
Many studies showed that these projects generally played an active 
role in combating desertification and fighting against dust storms 
in China over the past several decades (high confidence) (Cao et al. 
2018; State Forestry Administration of China 2015; Wang et al. 2013; 
Wang et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2013). At the beginning of the projects, 
some problems appeared in some places due to lack of enough 
knowledge and experience (low confidence) (Jiang 2016; Wang 
et al. 2010). For example, some tree species selected were not well 
suited to local soil and climatic conditions (Zhu et al. 2007), and 
there was inadequate consideration of the limitation of the amount 
of available water on the carrying capacity of trees in some arid 
regions (Dai 2011; Feng et al. 2016) (Section 3.6.4). In addition, at 
the beginning of the projects, there was an inadequate consideration 
of the effects of climate change on combating desertification (Feng 
et al. 2015; Tan and Li 2015). Indeed, climate change and human 
activities over past years have influenced the desertification and dust 
storm control effects in China (Feng et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2009; Tan 
and Li 2015), and future climate change will bring new challenges 
for combating desertification in China (Wang et al. 2017; Yin et al. 
2015; Xu et al. 2019). In particular, the desertification risk in China 
will be enhanced at 2°C compared to 1.5°C global temperature rise 
(Ma et al. 2018). Adapting desertification control to climate change 
involves: improving the adaptation capacity to climate change for 
afforestation and grassland management by executing SLM practices; 
optimising the agricultural and animal husbandry structure; and using 
big data to meet the water resources regulation (Zhang and Huisingh 
2018). In particular, improving scientific and technological supports 
in desertification control is crucial for adaptation to climate change 
and combating desertification, including protecting vegetation in 
desertification-prone lands by planting indigenous plant species, 
facilitating natural restoration of vegetation to conserve biodiversity, 
employing artificial rain or snow, water-saving irrigation and water 
storage technologies (Jin et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2013).
1.7.2.2 
The Green Dam in Algeria
After independence in 1962, the Algerian government initiated 
measures to replant forests destroyed by the war, and the steppes 
affected by desertification, among its top priorities (Belaaz 2003). 
In 1972, the government invested in the Green Dam (Barrage 
vert) project. This was the first significant experiment to combat 
desertification, influence the local climate and decrease the aridity 
by restoring a barrier of trees. The Green Dam extends across arid 
and semi-arid zones between the isohyets 300 mm and 200 mm. It is 
a 3 Mha band of plantation running from east to west (Figure 3.12). 
It is over 1200 km long (from the Algerian–Moroccan border to 
the Algerian–Tunisian border) and has an average width of about 
20 km. The soils in the area are shallow, low in organic matter and 
susceptible to erosion. The main objectives of the project were to 
conserve natural resources, improve the living conditions of local 
residents and avoid their exodus to urban areas. During the first four 
decades (1970–2000) the success rate was low (42%) due to lack 
of participation by the local population and the choice of species 
(Bensaid 1995). 
The Green Dam did not have the desired effects. Despite tree-planting 
efforts, desertification intensified on the steppes, especially in 
south-western Algeria, due to the prolonged drought during the 
1980s. Rainfall declined in the range from 18% to 27%, and the 
dry season has increased by two months in the last century (Belala 
et al. 2018). Livestock numbers in the Green Dam regions, mainly 
sheep, grew exponentially, leading to severe overgrazing, causing 
trampling and soil compaction, which greatly increased the risk of 
erosion. Wind erosion, very prevalent in the region, is due to climatic 
conditions and the strong anthropogenic action that reduced the 
vegetation cover. The action of the wind carries fine particles such as 
sands and clays and leaves on the soil surface a lag-gravel pavement, 
which is unproductive. Water erosion is largely due to torrential rains 
in the form of severe thunderstorms that disintegrate the bare soil 
surface from raindrop impact (Achite et al. 2016). The detached soil 
and nutrients are transported offsite via runoff, resulting in loss of 
fertility and water holding capacity. The risk of and severity of water 
erosion is a function of human land-use activities that increase soil 
loss through removal of vegetative cover. The National Soil Sensitivity 
to Erosion Map (Salamani et al. 2012) shows that more than 3 Mha of 
land in the steppe provinces are currently experiencing intense wind 
activity (Houyou et al. 2016) and that these areas are at particular 
risk of soil erosion. Mostephaoui et al. (2013), estimates that each 
year there is a loss of 7 t ha–1 of soils due to erosion. Nearly 0.6 Mha 
of land in the steppe zone are fully degraded without the possibility 
of biological recovery.
To combat the effects of erosion and desertification, the government 
has planned to relaunch the rehabilitation of the Green Dam by 
incorporating new concepts related to sustainable development, 
and adaptation to climate change. The experience of previous years 
has led to integrated rangeland management, improved tree and 
fodder shrub plantations and the development of water conservation 
techniques. Reforestation is carried out using several species, 
including fruit trees, to increase and diversify the sources of income 
for the population.
The evaluation of the Green Dam from 1972 to 2015 (Merdas et al. 
2015) shows that 0.3 Mha of forest plantation have been planted, 
which represents 10% of the project area. Estimates of the success 
rate of reforestation vary considerably between 30% and 75%,

depending on the region. Through demonstration, the Green Dam 
has inspired several African nations to work together to build a Great 
Green Wall to combat land degradation, mitigate climate change 
effects, loss of biodiversity and poverty in a region that stretches 
from Senegal to Djibouti (Sahara and Sahel Observatory (OSS) 2016) 
(Section 3.7.2.3).
1.7.2.3 
The Great Green Wall of the Sahara  
and the Sahel Initiative 
The Great Green Wall is an initiative of the Heads of State and 
Government of the Sahelo-Saharan countries to mitigate and adapt 
to climate change, and to improve the food security of the Sahel and 
Saharan peoples (Sacande 2018; Mbow 2017). Launched in 2007, this 
regional project aims to restore Africa’s degraded arid landscapes, 
reduce the loss of biodiversity and support local communities to 
sustainable use of forests and rangelands. The Great Green Wall 
focuses on establishing plantations and neighbouring projects, 
covering a distance of 7775 km from Senegal on the Atlantic coast to 
Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, with a width of 15 km (Figure 3.13). The 
wall passes through Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Niger, 
Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Senegal. 
The choice of woody and herbaceous species that will be used 
to restore degraded ecosystems is based on biophysical and 
socio-economic criteria, including socio-economic value (food, 
pastoral, commercial, energetic, medicinal, cultural); ecological 
importance (carbon sequestration, soil cover, water infiltration); 
and resilience to climate change and variability. The Pan-African 
Agency of the Great Green Wall (PAGGW) was created in 2010 
under the auspices of the African Union and CEN-SAD to manage the 
project. The initiative is implemented at the level of each country by 
a national structure. A monitoring and evaluation system has been 
defined, allowing nations to measure outcomes and to propose the 
necessary adjustments.
In the past, reforestation programmes in the arid regions of the Sahel 
and North Africa that have been undertaken to stop desertification 
were poorly studied and cost a lot of money without significant success 
(Benjaminsen and Hiernaux 2019). Today, countries have changed 
their strategies and opted for rural development projects that can be 
more easily funded. Examples of scalable practices for land restoration 
include managing water bodies for livestock and crop production, and 
promoting fodder trees to reduce runoff (Mbow 2017).
The implementation of the initiative has already started in several 
countries. For example, the FAO’s Action Against Desertification 
project was restoring 18,000 hectares of land in 2018 through 
planting native tree species in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, The Gambia, 
Niger, Nigeria and Senegal (Sacande 2018). Berrahmouni et al. (2016) 
estimated that 166 Mha can be restored in the Sahel, requiring the 
restoration of 10 Mha per year to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality 
targets by 2030. Despite these early implementation actions on the 
ground, the achievement of the planned targets is questionable, and 
will be challenging without significant additional funding.

1.7.3 
Invasive plant species
1.7.3.1 
Introduction
The spread of invasive plants can be exacerbated by climate change 
(Bradley et al. 2010; Davis et al. 2000). In general, it is expected 
that the distribution of invasive plant species with high tolerance 
to drought or high temperatures may increase under most climate 
change scenarios (medium to high confidence) (Bradley et al. 2010; 
Settele et al. 2014; Scasta et al. 2015). Invasive plants are considered 
a  major risk to native biodiversity and can disturb the nutrient 
dynamics and water balance in affected ecosystems (Ehrenfeld 
2003). Compared to more humid regions, the number of species 
that succeed in invading dryland areas is low (Bradley et al. 2012), 
yet they have a considerable impact on biodiversity and ecosystem 
services (Le Maitre et al. 2015, 2011; Newton et al. 2011). Moreover, 
human activities in dryland areas are responsible for creating new 
invasion opportunities (Safriel et al. 2005).
Current drivers of species introductions include expanding global 
trade and travel, land degradation and changes in climate (Chytrý 
et al. 2012; Richardson et al. 2011; Seebens et al. 2018). For example, 
Davis et al. (2000) suggests that high rainfall variability promotes the 
success of alien plant species – as reported for semi-arid grasslands 
and Mediterranean-type ecosystems (Cassidy et al. 2004; Reynolds 
et al. 2004; Sala et al. 2006). Furthermore, Panda et al. (2018) 
demonstrated that many invasive species could withstand elevated 
temperature and moisture scarcity caused by climate change. Dukes 
et al. (2011) observed that the invasive plant yellow-star thistle 
(Centaurea solstitialis) grew six time larger under the elevated 
atmospheric CO2 expected in future climate change scenarios. 
Climate change is likely to aggravate the problem as existing species 
continue to spread unabated and other species develop invasive 
characteristics (Hellmann et al. 2008). Although the effects of climate 
change on invasive species distributions have been relatively well 
explored, the greater impact on ecosystems is less well understood 
(Bradley et al. 2010; Eldridge et al. 2011).
Due to the time lag between the initial release of invasive species 
and their impact, the consequence of invasions is not immediately 
detected and may only be noticed centuries after introduction 
(Rouget et al. 2016). Climate change and invading species may act 
in concert (Bellard et al. 2013; Hellmann et al. 2008; Seebens et al. 
2015). For example, invasion often changes the size and structure 
of fuel loads, which can lead to an increase in the frequency and 
intensity of fire (Evans et al. 2015). In areas where the climate is 
becoming warmer, an increase in the likelihood of suitable weather 
conditions for fire may promote invasive species, which in turn may 
lead to further desertification. Conversely, fire may promote plant 
invasions via several mechanisms (by reducing cover of competing 
vegetation, destroying native vegetation and clearing a  path for 
invasive plants or creating favourable soil conditions) (Brooks et al. 
2004; Grace et al. 2001; Keeley and Brennan 2012).

At a regional scale, Bellard et al. (2013) predicted increasing risk in 
Africa and Asia, with declining risk in Australia (Figure 3.14). This 
projection does not represent an exhaustive list of invasive alien 
species occurring in drylands.
A set of four case studies in Ethiopia, Mexico, the USA and Pakistan 
is presented below to describe the nuanced nature of invading 
plant species, their impact on drylands and their relationship with 
climate change.
1.7.3.2 
Ethiopia
The two invasive plants that inflict the heaviest damage to 
ecosystems, especially biodiversity, are the annual herbaceous weed, 
Parthenium hysterophorus (Asteraceae) also known as Congress 
weed; and the tree species, Prosopis juliflora (Fabaceae) also called 
Mesquite, both originating from the southwestern United States to 
Central/South America (Adkins and Shabbir 2014). Prosopis was 
introduced in the 1970s and has since spread rapidly. Prosopis, 
classified as the highest priority invader in Ethiopia, is threatening 
livestock production and challenging the sustainability of the 
pastoral systems. Parthenium is believed to have been introduced 
along with relief aid during the debilitating droughts of the early 
1980s, and a recent study reported that it has spread into 32 out 
of 34 districts in Tigray, the northernmost region of Ethiopia (Teka 
2016). A  study by Etana et al. (2011) indicated that Parthenium 
caused a 69% decline in the density of herbaceous species in Awash 
National Park within a few years of introduction. In the presence of 
Parthenium, the growth and development of crops is suppressed due 
to its allelopathic properties. McConnachie et al. (2011) estimated 
a 28% crop loss across the country, including a 40–90% reduction 
in sorghum yield in eastern Ethiopia alone (Tamado et al. 2002). 
The weed is a substantial agricultural and natural resource problem 
and constitutes a significant health hazard (Fasil 2011). Parthenium 
causes acute allergic respiratory problems, skin dermatitis, and 
reportedly mutagenicity both in humans and livestock (Mekonnen 
2017; Patel 2011). The eastern belt of Africa – including Ethiopia – 
presents a very suitable habitat, and the weed is expected to spread 
further in the region in the future (Mainali et al. 2015).
There is neither a  comprehensive intervention plan nor a  clear 
institutional mandate to deal with invasive weeds, however, there 
are fragmented efforts involving local communities even though 
they are clearly inadequate. The lessons learned, related to actions 
that have contributed to the current scenario, are several. First, 
lack of coordination and awareness – mesquite was introduced by 
development agencies as a drought-tolerant shade tree with little 
consideration of its invasive nature. If research and development 
institutions had been aware, a  containment strategy could have 
been implemented early on. The second major lesson is the cost of 
inaction. When research and development organisations did sound 
the alarm, the warnings went largely unheeded, resulting in the 
spread and buildup of two of the worst invasive plant species in the 
world (Fasil 2011).

1.7.3.3 
Mexico
Buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris  L.), a  native species from southern 
Asia and East Africa, was introduced into Texas and northern 
Mexico in the 1930s and 1940s, as it is highly productive in drought 
conditions (Cox et al. 1988; Rao et al. 1996). In the Sonoran desert of 
Mexico, the distribution of buffelgrass has increased exponentially, 
covering 1 Mha in Sonora State (Castellanos-Villegas et al. 2002). 
Furthermore, its potential distribution extended to 53% of Sonora 
State and 12% of semi-arid and arid ecosystems in Mexico (Arriaga 
et al. 2004). Buffelgrass has also been reported as an aggressive 
invader in Australia and the USA, resulting in altered fire cycles that 
enhance further spread of this plant and disrupt ecosystem processes 
(Marshall et al. 2012; Miller et al. 2010; Schlesinger et al. 2013). 
Castellanos et al. (2016) reported that soil moisture was lower in 
the buffelgrass savannah cleared 35 years ago than in the native 
semi-arid shrubland, mainly during the summer. The ecohydrological 
changes induced by buffelgrass can therefore displace native plant 
species over the long term. Invasion by buffelgrass can also affect 
landscape productivity, as it is not as productive as native vegetation 
(Franklin and Molina-Freaner 2010). Incorporation of buffelgrass 
is considered a  good management practice by producers and the 
government. For this reason, no remedial actions are undertaken. 
1.7.3.4 
United States of America
Sagebrush ecosystems have declined from 25 Mha to 13 Mha since 
the late 1800s (Miller et al. 2011). A major cause is the introduction of 
non-native cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), which is the most prolific 
invasive plant in the USA. Cheatgrass infests more than 10 Mha in the 
Great Basin and is expanding every year (Balch et al. 2013). It provides 
a fine-textured fuel that increases the intensity, frequency and spatial 
extent of fire (Balch et al. 2013). Historically, wildfire frequency was 
60 to 110 years in Wyoming big sagebrush communities and has 
increased to five years following the introduction of cheatgrass 
(Balch et al. 2013; Pilliod et al. 2017).
The conversion of the sagebrush steppe biome to annual grassland 
with higher fire frequencies has severely impacted livestock 
producers, as grazing is not possible for a minimum of two years after 
fire. Furthermore, cheatgrass and wildfires reduce critical habitat for 
wildlife and negatively impact species richness and abundance – for 
example, the greater sage-grouse (Centocercus urophasianus) and 
pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) which are on the verge of 
being listed for federal protection (Crawford et al. 2004; Larrucea 
and Brussard 2008; Lockyer et al. 2015).
Attempts to reduce cheatgrass impacts through reseeding of both 
native and adapted introduced species have occurred for more than 
60 years (Hull and Stewart 1949) with little success. Following fire, 
cheatgrass becomes dominant and recovery of native shrubs and 
grasses is improbable, particularly in relatively low-elevation sites 
with minimal annual precipitation (less than 200 mm yr–1) (Davies 
et al. 2012; Taylor et al. 2014). Current rehabilitation efforts emphasise 
the use of native and non-native perennial grasses, forbs and shrubs 
(Bureau of Land Management 2005). Recent literature suggests 
that these treatments are not consistently effective at displacing 
cheatgrass populations or re-establishing sage-grouse habitat, with 
success varying with elevation and precipitation (Arkle et al. 2014; 
Knutson et al. 2014). Proper post-fire grazing rest, season-of-use, 
stocking rates, and subsequent management are essential to restore 
resilient sagebrush ecosystems before they cross a  threshold and 
become an annual grassland (Chambers et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2011; 
Pellant et al. 2004). Biological soil crust protection may be an effective 
measure to reduce cheatgrass germination, as biocrust disturbance 
has been shown to be a  key factor promoting germination of 
non-native grasses (Hernandez and Sandquist 2011). Projections of 
increasing temperature (Abatzoglou and Kolden 2011), and observed 
reductions in and earlier melting of snowpack in the Great Basin 
region (Harpold and Brooks 2018; Mote et al. 2005) suggest that there 
is a need to understand current and past climatic variability as this will 
drive wildfire variability and invasions of annual grasses.
1.7.3.5 
Pakistan
The alien plants invading local vegetation in Pakistan include 
Brossentia papyrifera (found in Islamabad Capital territory), 
Parthenium hysterophorus (found in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
provinces), Prosopis juliflora (found all over Pakistan), Eucalyptus 
camaldulensis (found in Punjab and Sindh provinces), Salvinia 
(aquatic plant widely distributed in water bodies in Sindh), Cannabis 
sativa (found in Islamabad Capital Territory), Lantana camara 
and Xanthium strumarium (found in upper Punjab and Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa provinces) (Khan et al. 2010; Qureshi et al. 2014). Most 
of these plants were introduced by the Forest Department decades 
ago for filling the gap between demand and supply of timber, 
fuelwood and fodder. These non-native plants have some uses but 
their disadvantages outweigh their benefits (Marwat et al. 2010; 
Rashid et al. 2014).
Besides being a  source of biological pollution and a  threat to 
biodiversity and habitat loss, the alien plants reduce the land value 
and cause huge losses to agricultural communities (Rashid et al. 
2014). Brossentia papyrifera, commonly known as Paper Mulberry, 
is the root cause of inhalant pollen allergy for the residents of lush 
green Islamabad during spring. From February to April, the pollen 
allergy is at its peak, with symptoms of severe persistent coughing, 
difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. The pollen count, although 
variable at different times and days, can be as high as 55,000 m–3. 
Early symptoms of the allergy include sneezing, itching in the eyes 
and skin, and blocked nose. With changing climate, the onset of 
disease is getting earlier, and pollen count is estimated to cross 
55,000 m–3 (Rashid et al. 2014). About 45% of allergic patients in the 
twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi showed positive sensitivity 
to the pollens (Marwat et al. 2010). Millions of rupees have been 
spent by the Capital Development Authority on pruning and cutting 
of Paper Mulberry trees but because of its regeneration capacity 
growth is regained rapidly (Rashid et al. 2014). Among other invading 
plants, Prosopis juliflora has allelopathic properties, and Eucalyptus is 
known to transpire huge amounts of water and deplete the soil of its 
nutrient elements (Qureshi et al. 2014).

Although a  Biodiversity Action Plan exists in Pakistan, it is not 
implemented in letter or spirit. The Quarantine Department focuses 
only on pests and pathogens but takes no notice of plant and animal 
species being imported. Also, there is no provision for checking the 
possible impacts of imported species on the environment (Rashid 
et al. 2014) or for carrying out bioassays of active allelopathic 
compounds of alien plants.
1.7.4 
Oases in hyper-arid areas in the Arabian 
Peninsula and northern Africa
Oases are isolated areas with reliable water supply from lakes and 
springs, located in hyper-arid and arid zones (Figure  3.15). Oasis 
agriculture has long been the only viable crop production system 
throughout the hot and arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula and 
North Africa. Oases in hyper-arid climates are usually subject to 
water shortage as evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall. This often 
causes salinisation of soils. While many oases have persisted for 
several thousand years, many others have been abandoned, often in 
response to changes in climate or hydrologic conditions (Jones et al. 
2019), providing testimony to societies’ vulnerability to climatic shifts 
and raising concerns about similarly severe effects of anthropogenic 
climate change (Jones et al. 2019).
On the Arabian Peninsula and in North Africa, climate change is 
projected to have substantial and complex effects on oasis areas 
(Abatzoglou and Kolden 2011; Ashkenazy et al. 2012; Bachelet et al. 
2016; Guan et al. 2018; Iknayan and Beissinger 2018; Ling et al. 2013). 
To illustrate, by the 2050s, the oases in southern Tunisia are expected 
to be affected by hydrological and thermal changes, with an average 
temperature increase of 2.7°C, a 29% decrease in precipitation and 
a 14% increase in evapotranspiration rate (Ministry of Agriculture 
and Water Resources of Tunisia and GIZ 2007). In Morocco, declining 
aquifer recharge is expected to impact the water supply of the Figuig 
oasis (Jilali 2014), as well as for the Draa Valley (Karmaoui et al. 
2016). Saudi Arabia is expected to experience a 1.8°C–4.1°C increase 
in temperatures by 2050, which is forecast to raise agricultural water 
demand by 5–15% in order to maintain production levels equal to 
those of 2011 (Chowdhury and Al-Zahrani 2013). The increase of 
temperatures and variable pattern of rainfall over the central, north 
and south-western regions of Saudi Arabia may pose challenges for 
sustainable water resource management (Tarawneh and Chowdhury 
2018). Moreover, future climate scenarios are expected to increase 
the frequency of fl oods and fl ash fl oods, such as in the coastal areas 
along the central parts of the Red Sea and the south-southwestern 
areas of Saudi Arabia (Almazroui et al. 2017).
While many oases are cultivated with very heat-tolerant crops such 
as date palms, even such crops eventually have declines in their 
productivity when temperatures exceed certain thresholds or hot 
conditions prevail for extended periods. Projections so far do not 
indicate severe losses in land suitability for date palm for the Arabian 
Peninsula (Aldababseh et al. 2018; Shabani et al. 2015). It is unclear, 
however, how reliable the climate response parameters in the 
underlying models are, and actual responses may differ substantially.

Date palms are routinely assumed to be able to endure very high 
temperatures, but recent transcriptomic and metabolomic evidence 
suggests that heat stress reactions already occur at 35°C (Safronov 
et al. 2017), which is not exceptionally warm for many oases in 
the region. Given current assumptions about the heat-tolerance 
of date palm, however, adverse effects are expected to be small 
(Aldababseh et al. 2018; Shabani et al. 2015). For some other 
perennial oasis crops, impacts of temperature increases are already 
apparent. Between 2004/2005 and 2012/2013, high-mountain oases 
of Al Jabal Al Akhdar in Oman lost almost all fruit and nut trees of 
temperate-zone origin, with the abundance of peaches, apricots, 
grapes, figs, pears, apples, and plums dropping by between 86% and 
100% (Al-Kalbani et al. 2016). This implies that that the local climate 
may not remain suitable for species that depend on cool winters to 
break their dormancy period (Luedeling et al. 2009). A similar impact 
is very probable in Tunisia and Morocco, as well as in other oasis 
locations in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa (Benmoussa 
et al. 2007). All these studies expect strong decreases in winter chill, 
raising concerns that many currently well-established species will no 
longer be viable in locations where they are grown today. The risk of 
detrimental chill shortfalls is expected to increase gradually, slowly 
diminishing the economic prospects to produce such species. Without 
adequate adaptation actions, the consequences of this development 
for many traditional oasis settlements and other plantations of 
similar species could be highly negative.
At the same time, population growth and agricultural expansion in 
many oasis settlements are leading to substantial increases in water 
demand for human consumption (Al-Kalbani et al. 2014). For example, 
a large unmet water demand has been projected for future scenarios 
in the valley of Seybouse in East Algeria (Aoun-Sebaiti et al. 2014), 
and similar conclusions were drawn for Wadi El Natrun in Egypt 
(Switzman et al. 2018). Modelling studies have indicated long-term 
decline in available water and increasing risk of water shortages – for 
example, for oases in Morocco (Johannsen et al. 2016; Karmaoui et al. 
2016), the Dakhla oasis in Egypt’s Western Desert (Sefelnasr et al. 
2014) and for the large Upper Mega Aquifer of the Arabian Peninsula 
(Siebert et al. 2016). Mainly due to the risk of water shortages, 
Souissi et al. (2018) classified almost half of all farmers in Tunisia as 
non-resilient to climate change, especially those relying on tree crops, 
which limit opportunities for short-term adaptation actions.
The maintenance of the oasis systems and the safeguarding of their 
population’s livelihoods are currently threatened by continuous water 
degradation, increasing soil salinisation, and soil contamination 
(Besser et al. 2017). Waterlogging and salinisation of soils due to 
rising saline groundwater tables coupled with inefficient drainage 
systems have become common to all continental oases in Tunisia, 
most of which are concentrated around saline depressions, known 
locally as chotts (Ben Hassine et al. 2013). Similar processes of 
salinisation are also occurring in the oasis areas of Egypt due to 
agricultural expansion, excessive use of water for irrigation and 
deficiency of the drainage systems (Abo-Ragab 2010; Masoud and 
Koike 2006). A prime example for this is Siwa oasis (Figure 3.16), 
a depression extending over 1050 km2 in the north-western desert 
of Egypt in the north of the sand dune belt of the Great Sand Sea 
(Abo-Ragab and Zaghloul 2017). Siwa oasis has been recognised as 
a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Site (GIAHS) by the FAO 
for being an in situ repository of plant genetic resources, especially 
of uniquely adapted varieties of date palm, olive and secondary 
crops that are highly esteemed for their quality and continue to play 
a significant role in rural livelihoods and diets (FAO 2016). 
The population growth in Siwa is leading rapid agricultural expansion 
and land reclamation. The Siwan farmers are converting the surrounding 
desert into reclaimed land by applying their old inherited traditional 
practices. Yet, agricultural expansion in the oasis mainly depends on 
non-renewable groundwaters. Soil salinisation and vegetation loss 
have been accelerating since 2000 due to water mismanagement 
and improper drainage systems (Masoud and Koike 2006). Between 
1990 and 2008, the cultivated area increased from 53 to 88 km2, lakes 
from 60 to 76 km2, sabkhas (salt flats) from 335 to 470 km2, and the 
urban area from 6 to 10 km2 (Abo-Ragab 2010). The problem of rising 
groundwater tables was exacerbated by climatic changes (Askri et al. 
2010; Gad and Abdel-Baki 2002; Marlet et al. 2009). 
Water supply is likely to become even scarcer for oasis agriculture 
under changing climate in the future than it is today, and viable 
solutions are difficult to find. While some authors stress the 
possibility to use desalinated water for irrigation (Aldababseh 
et al. 2018), the economics of such options, especially given the high 
evapotranspiration rates in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa, 
are debatable. Many oases are located far from water sources that 
are suitable for desalination, adding further to feasibility constraints. 
Most authors therefore stress the need to limit water use (Sefelnasr 
et al. 2014), for example, by raising irrigation efficiency (Switzman 
et al. 2018), reducing agricultural areas (Johannsen et al. 2016) or 
imposing water use restrictions (Odhiambo 2017), and to carefully 
monitor desertification (King and Thomas 2014). Whether adoption 
of crops with low water demand, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor 
(L.) Moench) or jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis (Link) C. K. Schneid.) 
(Aldababseh et al. 2018), can be a  viable option for some oases 
remains to be seen, but given their relatively low profit margins 
compared to currently grown oasis crops, there are reasons to doubt 
the economic feasibility of such proposals. While it is currently unclear 
to what extent oasis agriculture can be maintained in hot locations 
of the region, cooler sites offer potential for shifting towards new 
species and cultivars, especially for tree crops, which have particular 
climatic needs across seasons. Resilient options can be identified, but 
procedures to match tree species and cultivars with site climate need 
to be improved to facilitate effective adaptation.
There is high confidence that many oases of North Africa and the 
Arabian Peninsula are vulnerable to climate change. While the 
impacts of recent climate change are difficult to separate from 
the consequences of other change processes, it is likely that water 
resources have already declined in many places and the suitability 
of the local climate for many crops, especially perennial crops, has 
already decreased. This decline of water resources and thermal 
suitability of oasis locations for traditional crops is very likely to 
continue throughout the 21st century. In the coming years, the 
people living in oasis regions across the world will face challenges 
due to increasing impacts of global environmental change (Chen 
et al. 2018). Hence, efforts to increase their adaptive capacity to

climate change can facilitate the sustainable development of oasis 
regions globally. In particular this wil mean addressing the trade-offs 
between environmental restoration and agricultural livelihoods 
(Chen et al. 2018). Ultimately, sustainability in oasis regions will 
depend on policies integrating the provision of ecosystem services 
and social and human welfare needs (Wang et al. 2017).
1.7.5 
Integrated watershed management
Desertification has resulted in significant loss of ecosystem processes 
and services, as described in detail in this chapter. The techniques 
and processes to restore degraded watersheds are not linear and 
integrated watershed management (IWM) must address physical, 
biological and social approaches to achieve SLM objectives (German 
et al. 2007). 
1.7.5.1 
Jordan
Population growth, migration into Jordan and changes in climate 
have resulted in desertification of the Jordan Badia region. The 
Badia region covers more than 80% of the country’s area and 
receives less than 200 mm of rainfall per year, with some areas 
receiving less than 100 mm (Al-Tabini et al. 2012). Climate analysis 
has indicated a generally increasing dryness over the West Asia and 
Middle East region (AlSarmi and Washington 2011; Tanarhte et al. 
2015), with reduction in average annual rainfall in Jordan’s Badia 
area (De Pauw et al. 2015). The incidence of extreme rainfall events 
has not declined over the region. Locally increased incidence of 
extreme events over the Mediterranean region has been proposed 
(Giannakopoulos et al. 2009). 
The practice of intensive and localised livestock herding, in 
combination with deep ploughing and unproductive barley 
agriculture, are the main drivers of severe land degradation and 
depletion of the rangeland natural resources. This affected both 
the quantity and the diversity of vegetation as native plants with 
a high nutrition value were replaced with invasive species with low 
palatability and nutritional content (Abu-Zanat et al. 2004). The 
sparsely covered and crusted soils in Jordan’s Badia area have a low 
rainfall interception and infiltration rate, which leads to increased 
surface runoff and subsequent erosion and gullying, speeding up

the drainage of rainwater from the watersheds, which can result in 
downstream fl ooding in Amman, Jordan (Oweis 2017). 
To restore the desertifi ed Badia an IWM plan was developed using 
hillslope-implemented water harvesting micro catchments as 
a  targeted restoration approach (Tabieh et al. 2015). Mechanized 
Micro Rainwater Harvesting (MIRWH) technology using the ‘Vallerani 
plough’ (Antinori and Vallerani 1994; Gammoh and Oweis 2011; 
Ngigi 2003) is being widely applied for rehabilitation of highly 
degraded rangeland areas in Jordan. A tractor digs out small water 
harvesting pits on the contour of the slope (Figure 3.17) allowing the 
retention, infi ltration and local storage of surface runoff in the soil 
(Oweis 2017). The micro catchments are planted with native shrub 
seedlings, such as saltbush (Atriplex halimus), with enhanced survival 
as a function of increased soil moisture (Figure 3.18) and increased 
dry matter yields (>300 kg ha–1) that can serve as forage for livestock 
(Oweis 2017; Tabieh et al. 2015). 
Simultaneously to MIRWH upland measures, the gully erosion 
is being treated through intermittent stone plug intervention 
(Figure 3.19), stabilising the gully beds, increasing soil moisture in 
proximity of the plugs, dissipating the surface runoff’s energy, and 
mitigating further back-cutting erosion and quick drainage of water. 
Eventually, the treated gully areas silt up and dense vegetation cover 
can re-establish. In addition, grazing management practices are 
implemented to increase the longevity of the treatment. Ultimately, 
the recruitment processes and re-vegetation shall control the 
watershed’s hydrological regime through rainfall interception, surface 
runoff deceleration and fi ltration, combined with the less erodible 
and enhanced infi ltration characteristics of the rehabilitated soils.

In-depth understanding of the Badia’s rangeland status transition, 
coupled with sustainable rangeland management, are still subject 
to further investigation, development and adoption; a combination 
of all three is required to mitigate the ongoing degradation of the 
Middle Eastern rangeland ecosystems.
Oweis (2017) indicated that the cost of the fully automated 
Vallerani technique was approximately 32 USD ha–1. The total cost 
of the restoration package included the production, planting and 
maintenance of the shrub seedlings (11 USD ha–1). Tabieh et al. (2015) 
calculated a benefi t-cost ratio (BCR) of above 1.5 for re-vegetation of 
degraded Badia areas through MIRWH and saltbush. However, costs 
vary based on the seedling’s costs and availability of trained labour. 
Water harvesting is not a  recent scientifi c advancement. Water 
harvesting is known to have been developed during the Bronze Age 
and was widely practiced in the Negev Desert during the Byzantine 
time period (1300–1600 years ago) (Fried et al. 2018; Stavi et al. 
2017). Through construction of various structures made of packed 
clay and stone, water was either held on site in half-circular dam 
structures (hafi r) that faced up-slope to capture runoff, or on terraces 
that slowed water allowing it to infi ltrate and to be stored in the soil 
profi le. Numerous other systems were designed to capture water in 
below-ground cisterns to be used later to provide water to livestock 
or for domestic use. Other water harvesting techniques divert runoff 
from hillslopes or wadis and spread the water in a  systematic 
manner across playas and the toe-slope of a hillslope. These systems 
allow production of crops in areas with 100 mm of average annual 
precipitation by harvesting an additional 300+ mm of water (Beckers 
et al. 2013). Water harvesting is a proven technology to mitigate or 
adapt to climate change where precipitation may be reduced, and 
allow for small-scale crop and livestock production to continue 
supporting local needs. 
1.7.5.2 
India
The second great challenge after the Green Revolution in India was 
the low productivity in the rain-fed and semi-arid regions where 
land degredation and drought were serious concerns. In response 
to this challenge IWM projects were implemented over large areas 
in semi-arid biomes over the past few decades. IWM was meant to 
become a key factor in meeting a range of social development goals 
in many semi-arid rainfed agrarian landscapes in India (Bouma et al. 
2007; Kerr et al. 2002). Over the years, watershed development has 
become the fulcrum of rural development, and has the potential to 
achieve the twin objectives of ecosystem restoration and livelihood 
assurance in the drylands of India (Joy et al. 2004).
Many reports indicate signifi cant improvements in mitigation of 
drought impacts, raising crops and fodder, livestock productivity, 
expanding the availability of drinking water and increasing incomes 
as a  result of IWM (Rao 2000), but in some cases overall the 
positive impact of the programme has been questioned and, except 
in a few cases, the performance has not lived up to expectations 
(Joy et al. 2004; JM Kerr et al. 2002). Comparisons of catchments 
with and without IWM projects using remotely sensed data have 
sometimes shown no signifi cant enhancement of biomass, in part 
due to methodological challenges of space for time comparisons 
(Bhalla et al. 2013). The factors contributing to the successful cases 
were found to include effective participation of stakeholders in 
management (Rao 2000; Ratna Reddy et al. 2004).
Attribution of success in soil and water conservation measures was 
confounded by inadequate monitoring of rainfall variability and lack 
of catchment hydrologic indicators (Bhalla et al. 2013). Social and 
economic trade-offs included bias of benefi ts to downstream crop 
producers at the expense of pastoralists, women and upstream 
communities. This biased distribution of IWM benefi ts could 
potentially be addressed by compensation for environmental services 
between communities (Kerr et al. 2002). The successes in some areas 
also led to increased demand for water, especially groundwater, 
since there has been no corresponding social regulation of water 
use after improvement in water regime (Samuel et al. 2007). Policies 
and management did not ensure water allocation to sectors with 
the highest social and economic benefi ts (Batchelor et al. 2003). 
Limited fi eld evidence of the positive impacts of rainwater harvesting 
at the local scale is available, but there are several potential 
negative impacts at the watershed scale (Glendenning et al. 2012). 
Furthermore, watershed projects are known to have led to more 
water scarcity, and higher expectations for irrigation water supply, 
further exacerbating water scarcity (Bharucha et al. 2014).
In summary, the mixed performance of IWM projects has been 
linked to several factors. These include: inequity in the distribution 
of benefi ts (Kerr et al. 2002); focus on institutional aspects rather 
than application of appropriate watershed techniques and functional

aspects of watershed restoration (Joy et al. 2006; Vaidyanathan 2006); 
mismatch between scales of focus and those that are optimal for 
catchment processes (Kerr 2007); inconsistencies in criteria used to 
select watersheds for IWM projects (Bhalla et al. 2011); and in a few 
cases additional costs and inefficiencies of local non-governmental 
organisations (Chandrasekhar et al. 2006; Deshpande 2008). 
Enabling policy responses for improvement of IWM performance 
include: a  greater emphasis on ecological restoration rather than 
civil engineering; sharper focus on sustainability of livelihoods than 
just conservation; adoption of ‘water justice’ as a normative goal and 
minimising externalities on non-stakeholder communities; rigorous 
independent biophysical monitoring, with feedback mechanisms and 
integration with larger schemes for food and ecological security, and 
maintenance of environmental flows for downstream areas (Bharucha 
et al. 2014; Calder et al. 2008; Joy et al. 2006). Successful adaptation 
of IWM to achieve land degradation neutrality would largely depend 
on how IWM creatively engages with dynamics of large-scale 
land use and hydrology under a changing climate, involvement of 
livelihoods and rural incomes in ecological restoration, regulation 
of groundwater use, and changing aspirations of rural population 
(robust evidence, high agreement) (O’Brien et al. 2004; Samuel et al. 
2007; Samuel and Joy 2018).
1.7.5.3 
Limpopo River Basin
Covering an area of 412,938 km2, the Limpopo River basin spans 
parts of Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, 
eventually entering into the Mozambique Channel. It has been 
selected as a  case study as it provides a  clear illustration of the 
combined effect of desertification and climate change, and why IWM 
may be a crucial component of reducing exposure to climate change. 
It is predominantly a semi-arid area with an average annual rainfall 
of 400 mm (Mosase and Ahiablame 2018). Rainfall is both highly 
seasonal and variable, with the prominent impact of the El Niño/
La Niña phenomena and the Southern Oscillation leading to severe 
droughts (Jury 2016). It is also exposed to tropical cyclones that 
sweep in from the Mozambique Channel often leading to extensive 
casualties and the destruction of infrastructure (Christie and Hanlon 
2001). Furthermore, there is good agreement across climate models 
that the region is going to become warmer and drier, with a change 
in the frequency of floods and droughts (Engelbrecht et al. 2011; Zhu 
and Ringler 2012). Seasonality is predicted to increase, which in turn 
may increase the frequency of flood events in an area that is already 
susceptible to flooding (Spaliviero et al. 2014).
A clear need exists to both address exposure to flood events as well 
as predicted decreases in water availability, which are already acute. 
Without the additional impact of climate change, the basin is rapidly 
reaching a  point where all available water has been allocated to 
users (Kahinda et al. 2016; Zhu and Ringler 2012). The urgency of 
the situation was identified several decades ago (FAO 2004), with 
the countries of the basin recognising that responses are required at 
several levels, both in terms of system governance and the need to 
address land degradation. 
Recent reviews of the governance and implementation of IWM 
within the basin recognise that an integrated approach is needed 
and that a robust institutional, legal, political, operational, technical 
and support environment is crucial (Alba et al. 2016; Gbetibouo 
et al. 2010; Machethe et al. 2004; Spaliviero et al. 2011; van der 
Zaag and Savenije 1999). Within the scope of emerging lessons, two 
principal ones emerge. The first is capacity and resource constraints 
at most levels. Limited capacity within Limpopo Watercourse 
Commission (LIMCOM) and national water management authorities 
constrains the implementation of IWM planning processes 
(Kahinda et al. 2016; Spaliviero et al. 2011). Whereas strategy 
development is often relatively well-funded and resourced through 
donor funding, long-term implementation is often limited due 
to competing priorities. The second is adequate representation of 
all parties in the process in order to address existing inequalities 
and ensure full integration of water management. For example, 
within Mozambique, significant strides have been made towards 
the decentralisation of river basin governance and IWM. Despite 
good progress, Alba et al. (2016) found that the newly implemented 
system may enforce existing inequalities as not all stakeholders, 
particularly smallholder farmers, are adequately represented in 
emerging water management structures and are often inhibited by 
financial and institutional constraints. Recognising economic and 
socio-political inequalities, and explicitly considering them to ensure 
the representation of all participants, can increase the chances of 
successful IWM implementation.

Knowledge gaps and key uncertainties
• Desertification has been studied for decades and different 
drivers of desertification have been described, classified, and 
are generally understood (e.g.,  overgrazing by livestock or 
salinisation from inappropriate irrigation) (D’Odorico et al. 2013). 
However, there are knowledge gaps on the extent and severity 
of desertification at global, regional, and local scales (Zhang and 
Huisingh 2018; Zucca et al. 2012). Overall, improved estimation 
and mapping of areas undergoing desertification is needed. 
This requires a  combination of rapidly expanding sources of 
remotely sensed data, ground observations and new modelling 
approaches. This is a  critical gap, especially in the context of 
measuring progress towards achieving the Land Degradation 
Neutrality target by 2030 in the framework of SDGs.
• Despite numerous relevant studies, consistent indicators for 
attributing desertification to climatic and/or human causes are 
still lacking due to methodological shortcomings.
• Climate change impacts on dust and sand storm activity remain 
a critical gap. In addition, the impacts of dust and sand storms on 
human welfare, ecosystems, crop productivity and animal health 
are not measured, particularly in the highly affected regions such 
as the Sahel, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia. Dust 
deposition on snow and ice has been found in many regions of 
the globe (e.g., Painter et al. 2018; Kaspari et al. 2014; Qian et al. 
2015; Painter et al. 2013), however, the quantification of the 
effect globally, and estimation of future changes in the extent of 
this effect, remain knowledge gaps.

• Future projections of combined impacts of desertification and 
climate change on ecosystem services, fauna and flora, are lacking, 
even though this topic is of considerable social importance. 
Available information is mostly on separate, individual impacts 
of either (mostly) climate change or desertification. Responses  
to desertification are species-specific and mechanistic models  
are not yet able to accurately predict individual species responses 
to the many factors associated with desertification under 
changing climate. 
• Previous studies have focused on the general characteristics of 
past and current desertification feedbacks to the climate system. 
However, the information on the future interactions between 
climate and desertification (beyond changes in the aridity index) 
are lacking. The knowledge of future climate change impacts on 
such desertification processes as soil erosion, salinisation, and 
nutrient depletion remains limited both at the global and at the 
local levels. 
• Further research to develop the technologies and innovations 
needed to combat desertification is required, but it is also important 
to gain a better understanding of the reasons for the observed 
poor adoption of available innovations, to improve adoption rates.
• Desertification under changing climate has a high potential to 
increase poverty, particularly through the risks coming from 
extreme weather events (Olsson et al. 2014). However, the 
evidence rigorously attributing changes in observed poverty to 
climate change impacts is currently not available.
• The knowledge on the limits to adaptation to the combined 
effects of climate change and desertification is insufficient. This 
is an important gap since the potential for residual risks and 
maladaptive outcomes is high.
• Filling these gaps involves considerable investments in 
research and data collection. Using Earth observation systems 
in a standardised approach could help fill some of these gaps. 
This would increase data comparability and reduce uncertainty 
in approaches and costs. Systematically collected data would 
provide far greater insights than incomparable fragmented data.
Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 3.1 | 
How does climate change affect desertification? 
Desertification is land degradation in drylands. Climate change and desertification have strong interactions. Desertification affects 
climate change through loss of fertile soil and vegetation. Soils contain large amounts of carbon, some of which could be released 
to the atmosphere due to desertification, with important repercussions for the global climate system. The impacts of climate change 
on desertification are complex and knowledge on the subject is still insufficient. On the one hand, some dryland regions will receive 
less rainfall and increases in temperatures can reduce soil moisture, harming plant growth. On the other hand, the increase of CO2 
in the atmosphere can enhance plant growth if there are enough water and soil nutrients available. 
FAQ 3.2 | 
How can climate change induced desertification be avoided, reduced or reversed?
Managing land sustainably can help avoid, reduce or reverse desertification, and contribute to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation. Such sustainable land management practices include reducing soil tillage and maintaining plant residues to keep 
soils covered, planting trees on degraded lands, growing a wider variety of crops, applying efficient irrigation methods, improving 
rangeland grazing by livestock and many others.
FAQ 3.3 | 
 How do sustainable land management practices affect ecosystem services  
and biodiversity?
Sustainable land management practices help improve ecosystems services and protect biodiversity. For example, conservation 
agriculture and better rangeland management can increase the production of food and fibres. Planting trees on degraded lands 
can improve soil fertility and fix carbon in soils. Sustainable land management practices also support biodiversity through habitat 
protection. Biodiversity protection allows for the safeguarding of precious genetic resources, thus contributing to human well-being.
