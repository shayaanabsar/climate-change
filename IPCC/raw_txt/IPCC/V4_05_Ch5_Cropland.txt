5 CROPLAND 
5.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This section provides a tiered methodology for estimating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions from 
croplands. Cropland includes arable and tillable land, rice fields, and agroforestry systems where the vegetation 
structure falls below the thresholds used for the Forest Land category, and is not expected to exceed those 
thresholds at a later time. Cropland includes all annual and perennial crops as well as temporary fallow land (i.e., 
land set at rest for one or several years before being cultivated again). Annual crops include cereals, oils seeds, 
vegetables, root crops and forages. Perennial crops include trees and shrubs, in combination with herbaceous 
crops (e.g., agroforestry) or as orchards, vineyards and plantations such as cocoa, coffee, tea, oil palm, coconut, 
rubber trees, and bananas, except where these lands meet the criteria for categorisation as Forest Land. Arable 
land which is normally used for cultivation of annual crops but which is temporarily used for forage crops or 
grazing as part of an annual crop-pasture rotation (mixed system) is included under cropland.  
The amount of carbon stored in and emitted or removed from permanent cropland depends on crop type, 
management practices, and soil and climate variables. For example, annual crops (cereals, vegetables) are 
harvested each year, so there is no long-term storage of carbon in biomass. However, perennial woody 
vegetation in orchards, vineyards, and agroforestry systems can store significant carbon in long-lived biomass, 
the amount depending on species type and cultivar, density, growth rates, and harvesting and pruning practices. 
Carbon stocks in soils can be significant and changes in stocks can occur in conjunction with soil properties and 
management practices, including crop type and rotation, tillage, drainage, residue management and organic 
amendments. Burning of crop residue produces significant non-CO2 greenhouse gases and the calculation 
methods are provided.  
There is separate guidance for Cropland Remaining Cropland (CC) and Land Converted to Cropland (LC) 
because of the difference in carbon dynamics. Land-use conversions to Cropland from Forest Land, Grassland 
and Wetlands usually result in a net loss of carbon from biomass and soils as well as N2O to the atmosphere. 
However, Cropland established on previously sparsely vegetated or highly disturbed lands (e.g., mined lands) 
can result in a net gain in both biomass and soil carbon. Some changes, especially those dealing with soil carbon, 
may take place in periods of time longer than one year. The guidance covers the carbon pools shown in Box 5.1. 
The term land-use conversion refers only to lands coming from one type of use into another. In cases where 
existing perennial cropland is replanted to the same or different crops, the land use remains Cropland; therefore, 
the carbon stock changes should be estimated using the methods for Cropland Remaining Cropland, as described 
in Section 5.2 below.

CROPLAND REMAINING CROPLAND  
This section provides guidelines on greenhouse gas inventory for croplands that have not undergone any land-
use conversion for a period of at least 20 years as a default period 1. Section 5.3 provides guidelines on Land 
Converted to Cropland more recently than this. The annual greenhouse gas emissions and removals from 
Cropland Remaining Cropland include:  
‚Ä¢ 
Estimates of annual change in C stocks from all C pools and sources; and 
‚Ä¢ 
Estimates of annual emission of non-CO2 gases from all pools and sources. 
The changes in carbon stocks in Cropland Remaining Cropland are estimated using Equation 2.3. 
5.2.1 
Biomass 
5.2.1.1 
CHOICE OF METHODS 
Carbon can be stored in the biomass of croplands that contain perennial woody vegetation including, but not 
limited to, monocultures such as coffee, oil palm, coconut, rubber plantations, fruit and nut orchards, and 
polycultures such as agroforestry systems. The default methodology for estimating carbon stock changes in 
woody biomass is provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1. This section elaborates this methodology with respect to 
estimating changes in carbon stocks in biomass in Cropland Remaining Cropland.  
The change in biomass is only estimated for perennial woody crops. For annual crops, increase in biomass stocks 
in a single year is assumed equal to biomass losses from harvest and mortality in that same year - thus there is no 
net accumulation of biomass carbon stocks.  
Changes in carbon in cropland biomass (ŒîCCCB) may be estimated from either: (a) annual rates of biomass gain 
and loss (Chapter 2, Equation 2.7) or (b) carbon stocks at two points in time (Chapter 2, Equation 2.8). The first 
approach (gain-loss method) provides the default Tier 1 method and can also be used at Tier 2 or 3 with 
refinements described below. The second approach (the stock-difference method) applies either at Tier 2 or Tier 
3, but not Tier 1. It is good practice to improve inventories by using the highest feasible tier given national 
circumstances. It is good practice for countries to use a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method if carbon emissions and 
removals in Cropland Remaining Cropland is a key category and if the sub-category of biomass is considered 
significant. It is good practice for countries to use the decision tree in Figure 2.2 in Chapter 2 to identify the 
appropriate tier to estimate changes in carbon stocks in biomass. 
Tier 1 
The default method is to multiply the area of perennial woody cropland by a net estimate of biomass 
accumulation from growth and subtract losses associated with harvest or gathering or disturbance (according to 
Equation 2.7 in Chapter 2). Losses are estimated by multiplying a carbon stock value by the area of cropland on 
which perennial woody crops are harvested.  
Default Tier 1 assumptions are: all carbon in perennial woody biomass removed (e.g., biomass cleared and 
replanted with a different crop) is emitted in the year of removal; and perennial woody crops accumulate carbon 
for an amount of time equal to a nominal harvest/maturity cycle. The latter assumption implies that perennial 
woody crops accumulate biomass for a finite period until they are removed through harvest or reach a steady 
state where there is no net accumulation of carbon in biomass because growth rates have slowed and incremental 
gains from growth are offset by losses from natural mortality, pruning or other losses. 
Under Tier 1, default factors shown in Table 5.1, are applied to nationally derived estimates of land areas.   
Tier 2 
Two methods can be used for Tier 2 estimation of changes in biomass. Method 1 (also called the Gain-Loss 
Method) requires the biomass carbon loss to be subtracted from the biomass carbon increment for the reporting 
year (Chapter 2, Equation 2.7).  Method 2 (also called the Stock-Difference Method) requires biomass carbon 
stock inventories for a given land-use area at two points in time (Chapter 2, Equation 2.8). 
A Tier 2 estimate, in contrast, will generally develop estimates for the major woody crop types by climate zones, 
using country-specific carbon accumulation rates and stock losses where possible or country-specific estimates 
of carbon stocks at two points in time. Under Tier 2, carbon stock changes are estimated for above-ground and 
                                                           
1 Countries using higher tier methods may use different time periods depending on the time taken for carbon stocks to 
equilibrate after change in land use. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.8 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
below-ground biomass in perennial woody vegetation. Tier 2 methods involve country-specific or region-
specific estimates of biomass stocks by major cropland types and management system, and estimates of stock 
change as a function of major management system (e.g., dominant crop, productivity management).  To the 
extent possible, it is good practice for countries to incorporate changes in perennial crop or tree biomass using 
country-specific or region-specific data.  Where data are missing, default data may be used.   
Tier 3 
A Tier 3 estimate will use a highly disaggregated Tier 2 approach or a country-specific method involving process 
modelling and/or detailed measurement. Tier 3 involves inventory systems using statistically-based sampling of 
carbon stocks over time and/or process models, stratified by climate, cropland type and management regime. For 
example, validated species-specific growth models that incorporate management effects such as harvesting and 
fertilization, with corresponding data on management activities, can be used to estimate net changes in cropland 
biomass carbon stocks over time. Models, perhaps accompanied by measurements like those in forest 
inventories, can be used to estimate stock changes and extrapolate to entire cropland areas, as in Tier 2. 
Key criteria in selecting appropriate models are that they are capable of representing all of the management 
practices that are represented in the activity data. It is critical that the model be validated with independent 
observations from country-specific or region-specific field locations that are representative of climate, soil and 
cropland management systems in the country.  
5.2.1.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Emission and removal factors required to estimate the changes in carbon stocks include (a) annual biomass 
accumulation or growth rate, and (b) biomass loss factors which are influenced by such activities as removal 
(harvesting), fuelwood gathering and disturbance.  
Above-ground woody biomass growth rate 
Tier 1 
Tables 5.1 to 5.3 provide estimates of biomass stocks and biomass growth rates and losses for major climatic 
regions and agricultural systems. However, given the large variation in cropping systems, incorporating trees or 
tree crops, it is good practice to seek national data on above-ground woody biomass growth rate. 
Tier 2 
Annual woody biomass growth rate data can be, at a finer or disaggregated scale, based on national data sources 
for different cropping and agroforestry systems. Rates of change in annual woody biomass growth rate should be 
estimated in response to changes in specific management/land-use activities (e.g., fertilization, harvesting, 
thinning). Results from field research should be compared to estimates of biomass growth from other sources to 
verify that they are within documented ranges. It is important, in deriving estimates of biomass accumulation 
rates, to recognize that biomass growth rates will occur primarily during the first 20 years following changes in 
management, after which time the rates will tend towards a new steady-state level with little or no change 
occurring unless further changes in management conditions occur.  
Tier 3 
For Tier 3, highly disaggregated factors for biomass accumulation are needed. These may include categorisation 
of species, specific for growth models that incorporate management effects such as harvesting and fertilization. 
Measurement of above-ground biomass, similar to forest inventory with periodic measurement of above-ground 
biomass accumulation, is necessary.

Below-ground biomass accumulation 
Tier 1 
The default assumption is that there is no change in below-ground biomass of perennial trees in agricultural 
systems. Default values for below-ground biomass for agricultural systems are not available. 
Tier 2 
This includes the use of actually measured below-ground biomass data from perennial woody vegetation. 
Estimating below-ground biomass accumulation is recommended for Tier 2 calculation. Root-to-shoot ratios 
show wide ranges in values at both individual species (e.g., Anderson et al., 1972) and community scales (e.g., 
Jackson et al., 1996; Cairns et al., 1997). Limited data is available for below ground biomass thus, as far as 
possible, empirically-derived root-to-shoot ratios specific to a region or vegetation type should be used.  
Tier 3 
This includes the use of data from field studies identical to forest inventories and modelling studies, if stock 
difference method is adopted.  
Biomass losses from removal, fuelwood and disturbance 
Tier 1 
The default assumption is that all biomass lost is assumed to be emitted in the same year. Biomass removal, 
fuelwood gathering and disturbance loss data from cropland source are not available. FAO provides total 
roundwood and fuelwood consumption data, but not separated by source (e.g., Cropland, Forest Land, etc.). It is 
recognized that statistics on fuelwood are extremely poor and uncertain worldwide. Default removal and 
fuelwood gathering statistics (discussed in Chapter 4, Section 4.2) may include biomass coming from cropland 
such as when firewood is harvested from home gardens. Thus, it is necessary to ensure no double counting of 
losses occurs. If no data are available for roundwood or fuelwood sources from Cropland, the default approach 
will include losses in Forest Land (Section 4.2) and will exclude losses from Cropland. 
Tiers 2 and 3 
National level data at a finer scale, based on inventory studies or production and consumption studies according 
to different sources, including agricultural systems, can be used to estimate biomass loss. These can be obtained 
through a variety of methods, including estimating density (crown coverage) of woody vegetation from air 
photos (or high resolution satellite imagery) and ground-based measurement plots. Species composition, density 
and above-ground vs. below-ground biomass can vary widely for different cropland types and conditions and 
thus it may be most efficient to stratify sampling and survey plots by cropland types. General guidance on survey 
and sampling techniques for biomass inventories is given in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.3.   
5.2.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Activity data in this section refer to estimates of land areas of growing stock and harvested land with perennial 
woody crops. The area data are estimated using the approaches described in Chapter 3. They should be regarded 
as strata within the total cropland area (to keep land-use data consistent) and should be disaggregated depending 
on the tier used and availability of growth and loss factors. Examples of Cropland subcategories are given in 
Table 5.4.

Tier 1 
Under Tier 1, annual or periodic surveys are used in conjunction with the approaches outlined in Chapter 3 to 
estimate the average annual area of established perennial woody crops and the average annual area of perennial 
woody crops that are harvested or removed. The area estimates are further sub-divided into general climate 
regions or soil types to match the default biomass gain and loss values. Under Tier 1 calculations, international 
statistics such as FAO databases, and other sources can be used to estimate the area of land under perennial 
woody crops. 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.11 
Tier 2 
Under Tier 2, more detailed annual or periodic surveys are used to estimate the areas of land in different classes 
of perennial woody biomass crops. Areas are further classified into relevant sub categories such that all major 
combinations of perennial woody crop types and climatic regions are represented with each area estimate. These 
area estimates must match any country-specific biomass carbon increment and loss values developed for the Tier 
2 method. If country-specific finer resolution data are only partially available, countries are encouraged to 
extrapolate to the entire land base of perennial woody crops using sound assumptions from best available 
knowledge.  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 requires high-resolution activity data disaggregated at sub-national to fine grid scales. Similar to Tier 2, 
land area is classified into specific types of perennial woody crops by major climate and soil categories and other 
potentially important regional variables (e.g., regional patterns of management practices). Furthermore, it is good 
practice to relate spatially explicit area estimates with local estimates of biomass increment, loss rates, and 
management practices to improve the accuracy of estimates.

CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 AND TIER 2 
Summary of steps for estimating change in carbon stocks in biomass in Cropland 
Remaining Cropland (‚àÜCB) using the Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods 
Using the worksheets for Cropland (see Annex 1 ‚ÄìAFOLU Worksheets), calculate the change in biomass carbon 
stocks of Cropland Remaining Cropland: 
Step 1: Enter the subcategories of Cropland for the reporting year 
Typically, there are various types of Cropland with woody perennial cover in a country with varying biomass 
stocks and increments. Examples of these are: fruit orchards (e.g., mango, citrus), agricultural plantations (e.g., 
coconut, rubber) and agroforestry farms.  
Step 2: For each sub-category, enter the annual area of Cropland with perennial woody biomass 
The area (A) in hectares of each sub-category of Cropland can usually be obtained from national land-use 
agencies, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Natural Resources. Possible sources of data include: satellite 
images, aerial photography and land-based surveys, and FAO database. 
Step 3: For each sub-category, enter the mean annual carbon stocks in the biomass accumulation (in 
tonnes C ha yr-1) of perennial woody biomass 
The annual growth rates (ŒîCG) for each sub-category of Cropland, from the biomass accumulation rates G in 
Table 5.1, are entered in the appropriate column of worksheets.  
Step 4: For each sub-category, enter the annual carbon stocks in biomass losses (in tonnes C ha yr-1)  
If there is harvesting, the amount of carbon stocks from the biomass harvested (ŒîCL) is entered in the appropriate 
column. This can be estimated by multiplying the default above woody above ground biomass for various 
croplands in Table 5.3 by the default carbon density of 0.5 tonne C/tonne biomass. 
Step 5: Calculate the annual change of carbon stocks in biomass for each sub-category 
The annual change of carbon stocks in biomass (ŒîCB) is calculated using Equation 2.7 in Chapter 2. 
Step 6: Calculate the total change in carbon stocks (ŒîCB) by adding up all the values of the subcategory 
estimates.  
 
Example 1: In the inventory year, 90,000 hectares of perennial woody crops are cultivated in a 
tropical moist environment, while 10,000 ha are subjected to harvesting. The immature perennial 
woody cropland area accumulates carbon at a rate of approximately 2.6 tonnes of above ground C 
ha-1 yr-1. The area harvested looses all carbon in biomass stocks in the year of removal. Default 
carbon stock losses for a tropical moist perennial woody cropland are 21 tonnes C ha-1 yr-1. From 
these values, an estimated 234,000 tonnes C accumulates per year and 210,000 tonnes C are lost. 
Using Equation 2.7 in Chapter 2, the net change in carbon stocks (above-ground) in the tropical 
moist environment are 24,000 tonnes C yr-1.

UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
The following discussion provides guidance on approaches for assessing uncertainty associated with estimates of 
biomass carbon for each tier method.  
Tier 1 
The sources of uncertainty when using the Tier 1 method include the degree of accuracy in land area estimates 
(see Chapter 3) and in the default biomass carbon increment and loss rates. Uncertainty is likely to be low (<10%) 
for estimates of area under different cropping systems since most countries annually estimate cropland area using 
reliable methods. A published compilation of research on carbon stocks in agroforestry systems was used to 
derive the default data provided in Table 5.1 (Schroeder, 1994). While defaults were derived from multiple 
studies, their associated uncertainty ranges were not included in the publication. Therefore, a default uncertainty 
level of +75% of the parameter value has been assigned based on expert judgement. This information can be 
used, with a measure of uncertainty in area estimates from Chapter 3 of this Report, to assess the uncertainty in 
estimates of carbon emissions and removals in Cropland biomass using the Tier 1 methodology. Guidance on 
uncertainty analysis is given in Volume 1, Chapter 3.  
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 method will reduce overall uncertainty because country-specific emission and removal factors rates 
should provide more accurate estimates of carbon increment and loss for crop systems and climatic regions 
within national boundaries. It is good practice to calculate error estimates (i.e., standard deviations, standard 
error, or ranges) for country-specific carbon increment rates and to use these variables in a basic uncertainty 
assessment. It is good practice for countries to assess error ranges in country-specific coefficients and compare 
them to those of default carbon accumulation coefficients. If country-specific rates have equal or greater error 
ranges than default coefficients, then it is good practice to use a Tier 1 approach and to further refine country-
specific rates with more field measurements. 
Tier 2 approaches may also use finer resolution activity data, such as area estimates for different climatic regions 
or for specific cropping systems within national boundaries. The finer-resolution data will further reduce 
uncertainty levels when associated with biomass carbon increment factors defined for those finer-scale land 
bases (e.g., when area of coffee plantations is multiplied by a coffee plantation coefficient, rather than by a 
generic agroforestry default).  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches will provide the greatest level of certainty relative to Tiers 1 and 2 approaches. It is good 
practice to calculate standard deviations, standard errors, or ranges for all country-defined biomass increment 
and loss rates. It is good practice for countries to develop probability density functions for model parameters to 
use in Monte Carlo simulations. The uncertainty, particularly with respect to area estimates, is likely to be less or 
absent for cropping systems. 
5.2.2 
 Dead organic matter 
Methods for estimating carbon stock changes associated with dead organic matter pools are presented in this 
section for Cropland Remaining Cropland (CC). Methods are provided for two types of dead organic matter 
pools: 1) dead wood and 2) litter. Chapter 1of this report provides detailed definitions of these pools. 
Dead wood is a diverse pool with many practical problems for measuring in the field and associated uncertainties 
about rates of transfer to litter, soil, or emissions to the atmosphere. Carbon in dead wood is highly variable 
between stands across the landscape. Amounts of dead wood depend on the time of last disturbance, the amount 
of input (mortality) at the time of the disturbance, natural mortality rates, decay rates, and management. 
Litter accumulation is a function of the annual amount of litterfall, which includes all leaves, twigs and small 
branches, hay, fruits, flowers, and bark, minus the annual rate of decomposition. The litter mass is also 
influenced by the time since the last disturbance, and the type of disturbance.  Management such as wood and 
grass harvesting, burning, and grazing dramatically alter litter properties, but there are few studies clearly 
documenting the effects of management on litter carbon. 
In general, croplands will have little or no dead wood, crop residues or litter, with the exception of agroforestry 
systems which may be accounted under either Cropland or Forest Land, depending upon definitions adopted by 
countries for reporting.

5.13 
5.2.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The decision tree in Chapter 2, Figure 2.3 provides assistance in the selection of the appropriate tier level for the 
implementation of estimation procedures. Estimation of changes in carbon stocks in DOM requires an estimate 
of changes in stocks of dead wood and changes in litter stocks (refer to Equation 2.17 in Chapter 2). 
Each of the DOM pools (dead wood and litter) is to be treated separately, but the method for determining 
changes in each pool is the same. 
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method assumes that the dead wood and litter stocks are not present in Cropland or are at equilibrium 
as in agroforestry systems and orchards. Thus, there is no need to estimate the carbon stock changes for these 
pools. 
Tiers 2 and 3 
Tiers 2 and 3 allow for calculation of changes in dead wood and litter carbon due to management practices.  Two 
methods are suggested for estimating the carbon stock change in DOM.  
Method 1 (Also called the Gain-Loss Method, Equation 2.18 in Chapter 2):  Method 1 involves estimating the 
area of cropland management categories and the average annual transfer into and out of dead wood and litter 
stocks. This requires an estimate of area under Cropland Remaining Cropland according to: i) different climate 
or cropland types; ii) management regime, or other factors significantly affecting dead wood and litter carbon 
pools; and iii) the quantity of biomass transferred into dead wood and litter stocks as well as the quantity of 
biomass transferred out of the dead wood and litter stocks on per hectare basis according to different cropland 
types.  
Method 2 (Also called the Stock-Difference Method, Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2):   Method 2 involves 
estimating the area of cropland and the dead wood and litter stocks at two periods of time, t1 and t2.  The dead 
wood and litter stock changes for the inventory year are obtained by dividing the stock changes by the period 
(years) between two measurements. Method 2 is feasible for countries which have periodic inventories. This 
method is more suitable for countries adopting Tier 3 methods. Tier 3 methods are used where countries have 
country-specific emission factors and national data. Country-defined methodology may be based on detailed 
inventories of permanent sample plots for their croplands and/or models. 
5.2.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION/REMOVAL FACTORS 
Carbon fraction:  The carbon fraction of dead wood and litter is variable and depends on the stage of 
decomposition.  Wood is much less variable than litter and a value of 0.50 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 can be used for 
the carbon fraction.   
Tier 1 
The assumption in Tier 1 is that the DOM carbon stocks in all Cropland Remaining Cropland are insignificant or 
are not changing and therefore no emission/removal factors and activity data are needed. Countries experiencing 
significant changes in cropland management or disturbances that are likely to affect DOM pools are encouraged 
to develop domestic data to quantify this impact and report it under Tier 2 or 3 methodologies. 
Tier 2 
It is good practice to use country-level data on DOM for different Cropland categories, in combination with 
default values, if country-specific or regional values are not available for some Cropland categories. Country-
specific values for the transfer of carbon from live trees that are harvested to harvest residues, and decomposition 
rates (in the case of Method 1) or the net change in DOM pools (in the case of Method 2), can be derived from 
country-specific data, taking into account the Cropland type, the rate of biomass utilization, harvesting practices, 
and the amount of damaged vegetation during harvesting operations.  
Tier 3 
For Tier 3, countries should develop their own methodologies and parameters for estimating changes in DOM. 
These methodologies may be derived from Method 1 or 2 specified above, or may be based on other approaches.  
The method used needs to be clearly documented. 
National level disaggregated DOM carbon estimates should be determined as part of a national Cropland 
inventory, national level models, or from a dedicated greenhouse gas inventory programme, with periodic 
sampling according to the principles set out in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.3.  Inventory data can be coupled with 
modelling studies to capture the dynamics of all Cropland carbon pools.

5.2.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Activity data consist of areas of Cropland Remaining Cropland summarised by major cropland types and 
management practices. Total Cropland areas should be consistent with those reported under other sections of this 
chapter, notably under the biomass section of Cropland Remaining Cropland. Tying this information to national 
soils, climate, vegetation, and other geophysical data makes it easier to assess changes in DOM.  
5.2.2.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIERS 1 AND 2 
The following summarizes steps for estimating change in DOM carbon stocks 
Tier 1 
Activity data are not needed as the DOM pool is assumed to be stable.  
Tier 2 (Gain-Loss Method) ‚Äì Equation 2.18 in Chapter 2 
Each of the DOM pools (dead wood and litter) is to be treated separately, but the method for each pool is the 
same. 
Step 1: Determine the categories or Cropland types and management systems to be used in this assessment and 
the representative area.  Area data should be obtained using the methods described in Chapter 3.  
Step 2: Determine the net change in DOM stocks for each category.  Identify values from inventories or 
scientific studies for the average inputs and outputs of dead wood or litter for each category.  Countries should 
use locally available data for inputs and outputs from these pools. Calculate the net change in the DOM pools by 
subtracting the outputs from the inputs.  Negative values indicate a net decrease in the stock. 
Step 3: Determine the net change in DOM carbon stocks for each category based on Step 2.  Multiply the 
change in DOM stocks by the carbon fraction of the dead wood and litter to determine the net change in dead 
wood carbon stocks.  The default value is 0.50 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 for dead wood and 0.40 tonne C (tonne 
d.m.)-1 for litter.  
Step 4: Determine the total change in the DOM carbon pools for each category by multiplying the 
representative area of each category by the net change in DOM carbon stocks for that category.   
Step 5: Determine the total change in carbon stocks in DOM by taking the sum of the total changes in DOM 
across all categories.  
 
Tier 2 (Stock-Difference Method) ‚Äì Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2 
Each of the DOM pools is to be treated separately, but the method for each pool is the same. 
Step 1: Determine the categories to be used in this assessment and the representative area as described for 
Method 1. 
Step 2: Determine the net change in DOM stocks for each category.  From the inventory data, identify the 
inventory time interval, the average stock of DOM at the initial inventory (t1), and the average stock of DOM at 
the final inventory (t2).  Use these figures to calculate the net annual change in DOM stocks by subtracting the 
DOM stock at t1 from the DOM stock at t2 and dividing this difference by the time interval.  A negative value 
indicates a decrease in the DOM stock.   
Step 3: Determine the net change in DOM carbon stocks for each category.  Determine the net change in DOM 
carbon stocks by multiplying the net change in DOM stocks for each category by the carbon fraction of the 
DOM.  The default value is 0.50 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 for dead wood and 0.40 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 for litter.  
A Tier 3 approach requires country-specific or ecosystem-specific expansion factors.  A Tier 2 approach can use 
national level default expansion factors. 
Step 4: Determine the total change in the DOM carbon pool for each activity category by multiplying the 
representative area of each activity category by the net change in DOM carbon stocks for that category.   
Step 5: Determine the total change in carbon stocks in DOM by taking the sum of the total changes in DOM 
across all activity categories.

5.2.2.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Uncertainty estimation is not required at Tier 1 since the DOM stocks are assumed to be stable. For Tiers 2 and 
3, area data and estimates of uncertainty should be obtained using the methods in Chapter 3. Carbon 
accumulation and loss factors should be assessed locally.   
5.2.3 
Soil carbon 
Cropland management modifies soil C stocks to varying degrees depending on how specific practices influence 
C input and output from the soil system (Paustian et al., 1997; Bruce et al., 1999; Ogle et al., 2005).  The main 
management practices that affect soil C stocks in croplands are the type of residue management, tillage 
management, fertilizer management (both mineral fertilizers and organic amendments), choice of crop and 
intensity of cropping management (e.g., continuous cropping versus cropping rotations with periods of bare 
fallow), irrigation management, and mixed systems with cropping and pasture or hay in rotating sequences.  In 
addition, drainage and cultivation of organic soils reduces soil C stocks (Armentano and Menges, 1986).  
General information and guidance for estimating changes in soil C stocks are found in Section 2.3.3 of Chapter 
2 (including equations).  That section should be read before proceeding with specific guidelines dealing with 
Cropland soil C stocks. The total change in soil C stocks for Cropland is estimated using Equation 2.24 (Chapter 
2), which combines the change in soil organic C stocks for mineral soils and organic soils; and stock changes 
associated with soil inorganic C pools (Tier 3 only).  This section provides specific guidance for estimating soil 
organic C stock changes. Soil inorganic C is fully covered by Section 2.3.3.1. 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Cropland Remaining Cropland, countries need at a 
minimum, estimates of the Cropland area at the beginning and end of the inventory time period. If land-use and 
management data are limited, aggregate data, such as FAO statistics on Cropland, can be used as a starting point, 
along with expert knowledge about the approximate distribution of land management systems (e.g., medium, low 
and high input cropping systems, etc.). Cropland management classes must be stratified according to climate 
regions and major soil types, which can either be based on default or country-specific classifications.  This can 
be accomplished with overlays of land use on suitable climate and soil maps.   
5.2.3.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using a Tier 1, 2, or 3 approach, with each successive Tier requiring more detail 
and resources than the previous one.  It is also possible that countries will use different tiers to prepare estimates 
for the separate subcategories of soil C (i.e., soil organic C stocks changes in mineral soils and organic soils, and 
stock changes associated with soil inorganic C pools).  Decision trees are provided for mineral soils (Figure 2.4) 
and organic soils (Figure 2.5) in Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) to assist inventory compilers with selection of the 
appropriate tier for their soil C inventory.  
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For mineral soils, the estimation method is based on changes in soil organic C stocks over a finite period 
following changes in management that impact soil organic C.  Equation 2.25 (Chapter 2) is used to estimate 
change in soil organic C stocks in mineral soils by subtracting the C stock in the last year of an inventory time  
period (SOC0) from the C stock at the beginning of the inventory time period (SOC(0 ‚ÄìT)) and dividing by the 
time dependence of the stock change factors (D).  In practice, country-specific data on land use and management 
must be obtained and classified into appropriate land management systems (e.g., high, medium and low input 
cropping), including tillage management, and then stratified by IPCC climate regions and soil types.  Soil 
organic C stocks (SOC) are estimated for the beginning and end of the inventory time period using default 
reference carbon stocks (SOCref) and default stock change factors (FLU, FMG, FI ).   
Tier 2 
For Tier 2, the same basic equations are used as in Tier 1 (Equation 2.25), but country-specific information is 
incorporated to specify better the stock change factors, reference C stocks, climate regions, soil types, and/or the 
land management classification system.  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches may use dynamic models and/or detailed soil C inventory measurements as the basis for 
estimating annual stock changes. Estimates from models are computed using coupled equations that estimate the 
net change of soil C. A variety of models exist (e.g., see reviews by McGill et al., 1996; and Smith et al., 1997).  
Key criteria in selecting an appropriate model include its capability of representing all of the relevant 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.16 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
management practices/systems for croplands; model inputs (i.e., driving variables) are compatible with the 
availability of country-wide input data; and verification against experimental data.   
A Tier 3 approach may also be developed using a measurement-based approach in which a monitoring network 
is sampled periodically to estimate soil organic C stock changes.  A much higher density of benchmark sites will 
likely be needed than with models to represent adequately the combination of land-use and management systems, 
climate, and soil types.  Additional guidance is provided in Section 2.3.3.1 of Chapter 2. 
Organic soils 
Tier 1 
Equation 2.26 (Chapter 2) is used to estimate C stock change in organic soils (e.g., peat-derived, Histosols).   
The basic methodology is to stratify cultivated organic soils by climate region and assign a climate-specific 
annual C loss rate. Land areas are multiplied by the emission factor and then summed up to estimate annual C 
emissions. 
Tier 2 
For Tier 2, the same basic equations are used as in Tier 1 (Equation 2.26), but country-specific information is 
incorporated to better specify emission factors, climate regions, and/or a land management classification system.  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches for organic soils use dynamic models and/or measurement networks, as described above for 
mineral soils. 
5.2.3.2 
CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
Table 5.5 provides Tier 1 approach default stock change factors for land use (FLU), input (FI) and management 
(FMG).  The method and studies that were used to derive the default stock change factors are provided in Annex 
5A.1 and References. The default time period for stock changes (D) is 20 years and management practice is 
assumed to influence stocks to a depth of 30 cm, which is also the depth for the reference soil C stocks in Table 
2.3 (Chapter 2).   
Tier 2 
A Tier 2 approach entails the estimation of country-specific stock change factors.  Derivation of input (FI) and 
management factors (FMG) are based on comparisons to medium input and intensive tillage, respectively, because 
they are considered the nominal practices in the IPCC default management classification (see Choice of Activity 
Data).  It is good practice to derive values for a higher resolution classification of management, climate and soil 
types if there are significant differences in the stock change factors among more disaggregated categories based 
on an empirical analysis.  Reference C stocks can also be derived from country-specific data in a Tier 2 approach.  
Additional guidance is provided in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1.    
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects. See Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1 for further discussion.  
Organic soils 
Tier 1 
Default emission factors are provided in Table 5.6 for cultivated organic soils.  Assignment of emission factors 
for perennial tree systems, such as fruit trees that are classified as Cropland, may be based on the factors for 
cultivated organic soils in Table 5.6 or forest management of organic soils (see Chapter 4).  Shallower drainage 
will lead to emissions more similar to forest management, while deeper drainage of perennial tree systems will 
generate emissions more similar to annual cropping systems.  
Tier 2 
Emission factors are derived from country-specific experimental data in a Tier 2 approach.  It is good practice 
for emission factors to be derived for specific land management categories of Cropland on organic soils and/or a 
finer classification of climate regions, assuming the new categories capture significant differences in C loss rates.   
Additional guidance is given in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1. 
Tier 3 
Constant emission rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more accurately 
capture land-use and management effects.

5.2.3.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
Cropland systems are classified by practices that influence soil C storage. The default management classification 
system is provided in Figure 5.1. Inventory compilers should use this classification to categorize management 
systems in a manner consistent with the default Tier 1 stock change factors.  This classification may be further 
developed for Tiers 2 and 3 approaches. In general, practices that are known to increase C storage, such as 
irrigation, mineral fertilization, organic amendments, cover crops and high residue yielding crops, have higher 
inputs, while practices that decrease C storage, such as residue burning/removal, bare fallow, and low residue 
crop varieties, have lower inputs.  These practices are used to categorize management systems and then estimate 
the change in soil organic C stocks. Practices should not be considered that are used in less than 1/3 of a given 
cropping sequence (i.e., crop rotation), which is consistent with the classification of experimental data used to 
estimate the default stock change factors.  Rice production, perennial croplands, and set-aside lands (i.e., lands 
removed from production) are considered unique management systems (see below). 
Each of the annual cropping systems (low input, medium input, high input, and high input w/organic amendment) 
are further subdivided based on tillage management.  Tillage practices are divided into no-till (direct seeding 
without primary tillage and only minimal soil disturbance in the seeding zone; herbicides are typically used for 
weed control), reduced tillage (primary and/or secondary tillage but with reduced soil disturbance that is usually 
shallow and without full soil inversion; normally leaves surface with >30% coverage by residues at planting) and 
full tillage (substantial soil disturbance with full inversion and/or frequent, within year tillage operations, while 
leaving <30% of the surface covered by residues at the time of planting).  It is good practice only to consider 
reduced and no-till if they are used continuously (every year) because even an occasional pass with a full tillage 
implement will significantly reduce the soil organic C storage expected under the reduced or no-till regimes 
(Pierce et al., 1994; Smith et al., 1998).  Assessing the impact of rotational tillage systems (i.e., mixing reduced, 
no-till and/or full tillage practices) on soil C stocks will require a Tier 2 method.  
The main types of land-use activity data are: i) aggregate statistics (Approach 1), ii) data with explicit 
information on land-use conversions but without specific geo-referencing (Approach 2), or iii) data with explicit 
information on land-use conversions and geo-referencing (Approach 3), such as land-use and management 
inventories making up a statistically-based sample of a country‚Äôs land area (see Chapter 3 for discussion of 
approaches). At a minimum, globally available land-use and crop production statistics, such as FAO databases 
(http://faostat.fao.org/), provide annual compilations of total land area by major land-uses, select management 
data (e.g., irrigated vs. non-irrigated cropland), land area in ‚Äòperennial‚Äô crops (i.e., vineyards, perennial 
herbaceous crops, and tree-based crops such as orchards) and annual crops (e.g., wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, 
etc.). FAO databases would be an example of aggregate data (Approach 1). 
Management activity data supplement the land-use data, providing information to classify management systems, 
such as crop types and rotations, tillage practices, irrigation, manure application, residue management, etc.  
These data can also be aggregate statistics (Approach 1) or information on explicit management changes 
(Approach 2 or 3).  Where possible, it is good practice to determine the specific management practices for land 
areas associated with cropping systems (e.g., rotations and tillage practice), rather than only area by crop.  
Remote sensing data are a valuable resource for land-use and management activity data, and potentially, expert 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.20 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
knowledge is another source of information for cropping practices.  It is good practice to elicit expert knowledge 
using methods provided in Volume 1, Chapter 2 (eliciting expert knowledge). 
National land-use and resource inventories, based on repeated surveys of the same locations, constitute activity 
data gathered using Approach 2 or 3, and have some advantages over aggregated land-use and cropland 
management data (Approach 1).  Time series data can be more readily associated with a particular cropping 
system (i.e., combination of crop type and management over a series of years), and the soil type can be 
determined by sampling or by referencing the location to a suitable soil map. Inventory points that are selected 
based on an appropriate statistical design also enable estimates of the variability associated with activity data, 
which can be used as part of a formal uncertainty analysis. An example of a survey using Approach 3 is the 
National Resource Inventory in the U.S. (Nusser and Goebel, 1997). 
Activity data require additional in-country information to stratify areas by climate and soil types. If such 
information has not already been compiled, an initial approach would be to overlay available land cover/land-use 
maps (of national origin or from global datasets such as IGBP_DIS) with soil and climate maps of national 
origin or global sources, such as the FAO Soils Map of the World and climate data from the United Nations 
Environmental Program. A detailed description of the default climate and soil classification schemes is provided 
in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5.  The soil classification is based on soil taxonomic description and textural data, while 
climate regions are based on mean annual temperatures and precipitation, elevation, occurrence of frost, and 
potential evapotranspiration. 
Tier 2 
Tier 2 approaches are likely to involve a more detailed stratification of management systems than in Tier 1 (see 
Figure 5.1) if sufficient data are available. This can include further subdivisions of annual cropping input 
categories (i.e., low, medium, high, and high with amendment), rice cultivation, perennial cropping systems, and 
set-asides.  It is good practice to further subdivide default classes based on empirical data that demonstrates 
significant differences in soil organic C storage among the proposed categories.  In addition, Tier 2 approaches 
can involve a finer stratification of climate regions and soil types. 
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more 
detailed data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to the 
Tiers 1 and 2 methods, but the exact requirements will depend on the model or measurement design. 
Organic soils 
Tier 1 
In contrast to the mineral soil method, croplands on organic soils are not classified into management systems 
under the assumption that drainage associated with all types of management for crops stimulates oxidation of 
organic matter previously built up under a largely anoxic environment.  However, in order to apply the method 
described in Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2), croplands do need to be stratified by climate region and soil type (see 
Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5 for guidance on soil and climate classifications). 
Similar databases and approaches as those outlined for Mineral Soils in the Tier 1 discussion can be used for 
deriving area estimates. The land area with organic soils that are managed for Cropland can be determined using 
an overlay of a land-use map on climate and soils maps. Country-specific data on drainage projects combined 
with land-use surveys can be used to obtain a more refined estimate of the relevant areas. 
Tier 2 
Tier 2 approaches may involve a stratification of management systems if sufficient data are available. This can 
include subdivisions of annual cropping systems by drainage class, crop type (Freibauer, 2003) or tillage 
disturbance.  In addition, Tier 2 approaches can involve a finer stratification of climate regions. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches for organic soils are likely to include more detailed data on climate, soil, topographic and 
management data, relative to the Tiers 1 and 2 methods, but the exact requirements will depend on the model or 
measurement design.

CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
Mineral soils 
The steps for estimating SOC0 and SOC(0-T) and net soil C stock change per ha for Cropland Remaining 
Cropland on mineral soils are as follows: 
Step 1: Organize data into inventory time periods based on the years in which activity data were collected (e.g., 
1990 to 1995, 1995 to 2000, etc.) 
Step 2: Determine the amount Cropland Remaining Cropland by mineral soil types and climate regions in the 
country at the beginning of the first inventory time period.  The first year of the inventory time period will 
depend on the time step of the activity data (0-T; e.g., 5, 10 or 20 years ago). 
Step 3: Classify each Cropland into the appropriate management system using Figure 5.1.   
Step 4: Assign a native reference C stock values (SOCREF) from Table 2.3 based on climate and soil type.   
Step 5: Assign a land-use factor (FLU), management factor (FMG) and C input levels (FI) to each Cropland based 
on the management classification (Step 2).  Values for FLU, FMG and FI are given in Table 5.5.  
Step 6: Multiply the factors (FLU, FMG, FI) by the reference soil C stock (SOCREF) to estimate an ‚Äòinitial‚Äô soil 
organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) for the inventory time period.    
Step 7: Estimate the final soil organic C stock (SOC0) by repeating Steps 1 to 5 using the same native reference 
C stock (SOCREF), but with land-use, management and input factors that represent conditions for each cropland in 
the last (year 0) inventory year.  
Step 8: Estimate the average annual change in soil organic C stocks for Cropland Remaining Cropland 
(‚àÜCMineral) by subtracting the ‚Äòinitial‚Äô soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) from the final soil organic C stock (SOC0), 
and then dividing by the time dependence of the stock change factors (i.e., 20 years using the default factors).  If 
an inventory time period is greater than 20 years, then divide by the difference in the initial and final year of the 
time period.  
Step 9: Repeat steps 2 to 8 if there are additional inventory time periods (e.g., 1990 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, etc.). 
A numerical example is given below for Cropland Remaining Cropland on mineral soils, using Equation 2.25 
and default reference C stocks (Table 2.3) and stock change factors (Table 5.5). 
 
Example: The following example shows calculations for aggregate areas of cropland soil carbon 
stock change. In a warm temperate wet climate on Mollisol soils, there are 1Mha of permanent 
annual cropland. The native reference carbon stock (SOCREF) for the region is 88 tonnes C ha-1. At 
the beginning of the inventory calculation period (in this example, 10 yrs earlier in 1990), the 
distribution of cropland systems were 400,000 ha of annual cropland with low carbon input levels 
and full tillage and 600,000 ha of annual cropland with medium input levels and full tillage. Thus, 
initial soil carbon stocks for the area were: 400,000 ha ‚óè (88 tonnes C ha-1 ‚óè 0.69 ‚óè 1 ‚óè 0.92) + 
600,000 ha ‚óè (88 tonnes C ha-1 ‚óè 0.69 ‚óè 1 ‚óè 1) = 58.78 million tonnes C. In the last year of the 
inventory time period (in this example, the last year is 2000), there are: 200,000 ha of annual 
cropping with full tillage and low C input, 700,000 ha of annual cropping with reduced tillage and 
medium C input, and 100,000 ha of annual cropping with no-till and medium C input. Thus, total 
soil carbon stocks in the inventory year are: 200,000 ha ‚óè (88 tonnes C ha-1 ‚óè 0.69 ‚óè 1 ‚óè 0.92) + 
700,000 ha ‚óè (88 tonnes C ha-1 ‚óè 0.69 ‚óè 1.08 ‚óè 1) + 100,000 ha ‚óè (88 tonnes C ha-1 ‚óè 0.69 ‚óè 1.15 
‚óè 1) = 64.06 million tonnes C. Thus, the average annual stock change over the period for the entire 
area is: 64.06 ‚Äì 58.78 = 5.28 million tonnes/20 yr = 264,000 tonnes C per year soil C stock 
increase (Note: 20 years is the time dependence of the stock change factor, i.e., factor represents 
annual rate of change over 20 years).  
 
Organic soils 
The steps for estimating the loss of soil C from drained organic soils are as follows: 
Step 1: Organize data into inventory time periods based on the years in which activity data were collected (e.g., 
1990 to 1995, 1995 to 2000, etc.) 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.23 
Step 2: Determine the amount of Cropland Remaining Cropland on organic soils for the last year of each 
inventory time period.   
Step 3: Assign the appropriate emission factor (EF) for annual losses of CO2 based on climate (from Table 5.6).  
Step 4: Estimate total emissions by summing the product of area (A) multiplied by the emission factor (EF) for 
all climate zones. 
Step 5: Repeat for additional inventory time periods. 
 
A numerical example is given below for Cropland Remaining Cropland on drained organic soils, using Equation 
2.26 and default emission factors (Table 5.6). 
 
Example: The following example shows calculations for aggregate areas of cropland soil carbon 
stock change. In a warm temperate wet climate on Histosols, there are 0.4 Mha of permanent 
annual cropland on drained organic soils. The emission factor for this climate is 10.0 tonnes C ha-1 
yr-1.   Thus, annual soil carbon stock change for organic soils during the inventory time period is: 
400,000 ha ‚óè 10.0 tonnes C ha-1 = 4.0 million tonnes C yr-1.  
 
5.2.3.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Three broad sources of uncertainty exist in soil C inventories: 1) uncertainties in land-use and management 
activity, and environmental data; 2) uncertainties in reference soil C stocks if using a Tier 1 or 2 approach 
(mineral soils only); and 3) uncertainties in the stock change/emission factors for Tier 1 or 2 approaches, model 
structure/parameter error for Tier 3 model-based approaches, or measurement error/sampling variability 
associated with Tier 3 measurement-based inventories.   In general, precision of an inventory is increased and 
confidence ranges are smaller with more sampling to estimate values for the three board categories, while 
reducing bias (i.e., improve accuracy) is more likely to occur through the development of a higher Tier inventory 
that incorporates country-specific information.   
For Tier 1, uncertainties are provided with the reference C stocks in the first footnote in Table 2.3, stock change 
factors in Table 5.5, and emission factor for organic soils in Table 5.6.  Uncertainties in land-use and 
management data will need to be addressed by the inventory compiler, and then combined with uncertainties for 
the default factors and reference C stocks (mineral soils only) using an appropriate method, such as simple error 
propagation equations.  If using aggregate land-use area statistics for activity data (e.g., FAO data), the inventory 
agency may have to apply a default level of uncertainty for the land area estimates (¬±50%). It is good practice 
for the inventory compiler to derive uncertainties from country-specific activity data instead of using a default 
level.  
Default reference C stocks and stock change factors for mineral soils and emission factors for organic soils can 
have inherently high uncertainties, particularly bias, when applied to specific countries. Defaults represent 
globally averaged values of land-use and management impacts or reference C stocks that may vary from region-
specific values (Powers et al., 2004; Ogle et al., 2006). Bias can be reduced by deriving country-specific factors 
using a Tier 2 method or by developing a Tier 3 country-specific estimation system. The underlying basis for 
higher Tier approaches will be experiments in the country or neighbouring regions that address the effect of land 
use and management on soil C.  In addition, it is good practice to further minimize bias by accounting for 
significant within-country differences in land-use and management impacts, such as variation among climate 
regions and/or soil types, even at the expense of reduced precision in the factor estimates (Ogle et al., 2006).  
Bias is considered more problematic for reporting stock changes because it is not necessarily captured in the 
uncertainty range (i.e., the true stock change may be outside of the reported uncertainty range if there is 
significant bias in the factors).  
Uncertainties in land-use activity statistics may be reduced through a better national system, such as developing 
or extending a ground-based survey with additional sample locations and/or incorporating remote sensing to 
provide additional coverage.  It is good practice to design a classification that captures the majority of land-use 
and management activity with a sufficient sample size to minimize uncertainty at the national scale. 
For Tier 2 methods, country-specific information is incorporated into the inventory analysis for purposes of 
reducing bias. For example, Ogle et al. (2003) utilized country-specific data to construct probability distribution 
functions for US specific factors, activity data and reference C stocks for agricultural soils. It is good practice to 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.24 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
evaluate dependencies among the factors, reference C stocks or land-use and management activity data.  In 
particular, strong dependencies are common in land-use and management activity data because management 
practices tend to be correlated in time and space.  Combining uncertainties in stock change/emission factors, 
reference C stocks and activity data can be done using methods such as simple error propagation equations or 
Monte-Carlo procedures to estimate means and standard deviations for the change in soil C stocks (Ogle et al., 
2003; Vanden Bygaart et al., 2004). 
Tier 3 models are more complex and simple error propagation equations may not be effective at quantifying the 
associated uncertainty in resulting estimates.  Monte Carlo analyses are possible (Smith and Heath, 2001), but 
can be difficult to implement if the model has many parameters (some models can have several hundred 
parameters) because joint probability distribution functions must be constructed quantifying the variance as well 
as covariance among the parameters.  Other methods are also available such as empirically-based approaches 
(Monte et al., 1996), which use measurements from a monitoring network to statistically evaluate the 
relationship between measured and modelled results (Falloon and Smith, 2003).  In contrast to modelling, 
uncertainties in measurement-based Tier 3 inventories can be estimated from the sample variance, measurement 
error and other relevant sources of uncertainty.     
5.2.4 
Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from biomass 
burning 
Non-CO2 emissions from Cropland Remaining Cropland (particularly CH4, CO, NOx and N2O) are usually 
associated with burning of agriculture residues, which vary by country, crop, and management system. CO2 
emissions from biomass burning do not have to be reported, since the carbon released during the combustion 
process is assumed to be reabsorbed by the vegetation during the next growing season.  
The percentage of the agricultural crop residues burnt on-site, which is the mass of fuel available for burning, 
should be estimated taking into account the fractions removed before burning due to animal consumption, decay 
in the field, and use in other sectors (e.g., biofuel, domestic livestock feed, building materials, etc.). This is 
important to eliminate the possibility of double counting.  
The methodology for estimating non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning in Cropland Remaining Cropland 
follows the generic formulation in Equation 2.27 in Chapter 2.  The estimates should be based on annual data.  
5.2.4.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The decision tree in Figure 2.6 in Chapter 2 provides general guidance on the choice of the appropriate Tier to be 
used. The method of estimation of greenhouse gas emission from biomass burning involves the use of Equation 
2.27 (Chapter 2). Under a Tier 1 approach, the activity data are normally highly aggregated, and combustion and 
emissions factors are the default values provided in Chapter 2. Under a Tier 2, estimates are generally developed 
for the major crop types by climate zone, using country-specific residue accumulation rates and country-specific 
combustion and emission estimates. Tier 3 is a very country-specific method involving process modelling and/or 
detailed measurement. 
All countries should strive for improving inventory and reporting approaches by applying the highest Tier 
possible, given national circumstances. If burning in Cropland Remaining Cropland is a key category, countries 
should use either Tier 2 or Tier 3 method.   
5.2.4.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1 
Countries applying a Tier 1 method should replace quantities MB and Cf in Equation 2.27 in Chapter 2 by the 
appropriate default fuel consumption value (MB x Cf) in Table 2.4. The default emission factors to be used are 
provided in Table 2.5 for each greenhouse gas of interest.  
Tier 2 
This method expands Tier 1 to include use of country-specific available fuel, combustion and emission factors. 
Countries may estimate the amount of available fuel from crop production statistics and from the ratio of crop 
yield and residue produced. Field studies are needed to estimate the fractions of crop residue removed from field 
(as fuel or fodder) and left as residue for burning for different crop systems. Countries should focus on the most 
dominant crops being burnt or the systems with relatively high biomass per hectare and levels of emissions per 
unit of land (e.g., sugarcane, cotton).  
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.25 
Tier 3 
This tier makes use of models based on country-specific parameters, using national inventory data to ensure that 
no burning of crop residues is omitted. Tier 3 depends on the field measurement of the amount of residues burnt 
on-site for different cropping systems under different climate zones and management systems, based on 
sampling methods described in Chapter 3 (Annex 3A.3).  Countries should prioritize the development of 
country-specific combustion and emission factors, by focusing on the most dominant crop residues being burnt.   
5.2.4.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Tier 1 
Activity data includes estimates of land areas under the crop types for which agricultural residues are normally 
burnt. This can be obtained in consultation with national agricultural governmental sectors, in the lack of 
objective data from satellite imagery, for example. Countries can also estimate the crop area planted from the 
annual crop production and an estimate of the average productivity per hectare.  If no national estimates are 
available, FAO statistics can be used. It is good practice to cross check FAO data with national sources.  
Tier 2 
Under a Tier 2 method, countries should use more disaggregated area estimates (e.g., major crop types by 
climate zone) with country-specific and crop management system-specific residue accumulation rates. This can 
be accomplished through the use of more detailed annual or periodic surveys to estimate the areas of land under 
different crop classes. Areas should be further classified into relevant categories such that all major combinations 
of crop types and climatic regions are represented, with individual area estimates provided. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 requires high-resolution activity data disaggregated at sub-national to fine grid scales. Similar to Tier 2, 
land area is classified into specific types of crops by major climate and soil categories and other potentially 
important regional variables (e.g., regional patterns of management practices) to be used in models. Countries 
should strive to obtain spatially explicit area estimates to facilitate complete coverage of the cropland and ensure 
that areas are not over- nor under-estimated. Additionally, spatially explicit area estimates can be related to 
locally relevant emission rates and management impacts, improving the accuracy of the estimates. Area data for 
different cropping systems used should be consistent with area used in earlier sections (Biomass, Dead organic 
matter), though residues may be burnt on only a part of the total area. 
5.2.4.4 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Estimates of the area planted under each crop type for which residues are normally burnt may be highly 
uncertain. Global statistics of crop production, which may be an indirect way to estimate area planted, if not 
updated on a yearly basis, may be very uncertain. The fraction of the agricultural residue that is burnt in the field 
is possibly the variable with most uncertainty. Tier 2 estimates are more precise, being based on country-specific 
parameters. It is good practice to provide error estimates (i.e., standard deviation, standard error, ranges) for 
country-specific combustion and emission factors and areas burnt. 
5.3 
LAND CONVERTED TO CROPLAND 
Globally, about 50% of the total land surface has been transformed by direct human action, 20% of land 
ecosystems have been converted to permanent croplands, and 25% of the world‚Äôs forests have been cleared for 
various uses such as crop cultivation and pastures (Moore, 2002). Area under cropland has been increasing in 
some parts of the world to meet growing food and fibre demands. Most of the expansion of cropland in the last 
two decades has occurred in Southeast Asia, parts of South Asia, the Great Lakes region of eastern Africa and 
the Amazon Basin (Millennium Ecosystems Assessment, 2005). During the same period, forest destruction in the 
tropics 
averaged

per 
year 
according 
to 
Environmental 
Group 
Limited 
(http://www.environmental.com.au/). Deforestation rate during the 1990‚Äôs averaged 14.6 million ha per year. 
Conversion to Cropland is a leading land-use change following tropical deforestation. Greenhouse gas emissions 
and removals from Land Converted to Cropland can be a key source for many countries.   
Estimation of annual greenhouse gas emissions and removals from Land Converted to Cropland includes the

CHOICE OF METHODS 
This section provides guidance on methods for calculating carbon stock change in biomass due to the conversion 
of land from natural conditions and other uses to Cropland, including deforestation and conversion of pasture 
and grazing lands to Cropland. The methods require estimates of carbon in biomass stocks prior to and following 
conversion, based on estimates of the areas of lands converted during the period between land-use surveys. As a 
result of conversion to Cropland, it is assumed (in Tier 1) that the dominant vegetation is removed entirely 
leading to emissions, resulting in near zero amounts of carbon remaining in biomass. Some type of cropping 
system is planted soon thereafter increasing the amount of carbon stored in biomass. The difference between 
initial and final biomass carbon pools is used to calculate carbon stock change from land-use conversion;  and in 
subsequent years accumulations and losses in perennial woody biomass in Cropland are counted using methods 
in Section 5.2.1 (Cropland Remaining Cropland).  
It is good practice to consider all carbon pools (i.e., above ground and below ground biomass, dead organic 
matter, and soils) in estimating changes in carbon stocks in Land Converted to Cropland. Currently, there is 
insufficient information to provide a default approach with default parameters to estimate carbon stock change in 
dead organic matter (DOM) pools2. DOM is unlikely to be important except in the year of conversion. It is 
assumed that there will be no DOM in Cropland. In addition, the methodology below considers only carbon 
stock change in above-ground biomass since limited data are available on below-ground carbon stocks in 
perennial Cropland. 
The IPCC Guidelines describe increasingly sophisticated alternatives that incorporate greater detail on the areas 
of land converted, carbon stocks on lands, and loss of carbon resulting from land conversions. It is good practice 
to adopt the appropriate tier depending on key source analysis, data availability and national circumstances. All 
countries should strive for improving inventory and reporting approaches by advancing to the highest tier 
possible given national circumstances. It is good practice for countries to use a Tier 2 or Tier 3 approach if 
carbon emissions and removals in Land Converted to Cropland is a key category and if the sub-category of 
biomass is considered significant based on principles outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 4. Countries should use the 
decision tree in Figure 1.3 to help with the choice of method. Land Converted to Cropland is likely to be a key 
category for many countries and further biomass is likely to be a key source.  
Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method follows the approach in Chapter 4 (Forest Land) where the amount of biomass that is cleared 
for cropland is estimated by multiplying the area converted in one year by the average carbon stock in biomass in 
the Forest Land or Grassland prior to conversion. It is good practice to account completely for all land 
conversions to Cropland. Thus, this section elaborates on the method such that it includes different initial uses, 
including but not limited to forests.  
Equation 2.15 in Chapter 2 summarises the major elements of a first-order estimation of carbon stock change 
from land-use conversion to Cropland. Average carbon stock change on a per hectare basis is estimated for each 
type of conversion. The average carbon stock change is equal to the carbon stock change due to the removal of 
biomass from the initial land use (i.e., carbon in biomass immediately after conversion minus the carbon in 
biomass prior to conversion), plus carbon stocks from one year of growth in Cropland following conversion. It is 
necessary to account only for any woody vegetation that replaces the vegetation that was cleared during land-use 
conversion. The GPG-LULUCF combines carbon in biomass after conversion and carbon in biomass that grows 
on the land following conversion into a single term. In this method, they are separated into two terms, BAFTER 
and ŒîCG to increase transparency.  
At Tier 1, carbon stocks in biomass immediately after conversion (BAFTER) are assumed to be zero, since the land 
is cleared of all vegetation before planting crops. Average carbon stock change per hectare for a given land-use 
conversion is multiplied by the estimated area of lands undergoing such a conversion in a given year. In 
subsequent years, change in biomass of annual crops is considered zero because carbon gains in biomass from 
annual growth are offset by losses from harvesting. Changes in biomass of perennial woody crops are counted 
following the methodology in Section 2.3.1.1 (Change in carbon stocks in biomass in land remaining in a land-
use category). 
                                                           
2 Any litter and dead wood pools (estimated using the methods described in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2) should be assumed 
oxidized following land conversion. 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.27 
The default assumption for Tier 1 is that all carbon in biomass removed is lost to the atmosphere through burning 
or decay processes either on-site or off-site. Tier 1 calculations do not differentiate immediate emissions from 
burning and other conversion related losses.   
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 calculations are structurally similar to Tier 1, with the following distinctions. First, Tier 2 relies 
largely on country-specific estimates of the carbon stocks in initial and final land uses rather than the default data. 
Area estimates for Land Converted to Cropland are disaggregated according to original vegetation (e.g., from 
Forest Land or Grassland) at finer spatial scales to capture regional and crop systems variations in country-
specific carbon stocks values. 
Second, Tier 2 may modify the assumption that carbon stocks immediately following conversion are zero. This 
enables countries to take into account land-use transitions where some, but not all, vegetation from the original 
land use is removed. 
Third, under Tier 2, it is good practice to apportion carbon losses to burning and decay processes if applicable. 
Emissions of carbon dioxide occur as a result of burning and decay in land-use conversions. Further, non-CO2 
trace gas emissions occur as a result of burning. By partitioning losses to burning and decay, countries can also 
calculate non-CO2 trace gas emissions from burning (Section 5.3.4).  
The immediate impacts of land conversion activities on the five carbon stocks can be summarized in a 
disturbance matrix, which describes the retention, transfers and releases of carbon in the pools in the original 
ecosystem following conversion to Cropland. A disturbance matrix defines for each pool the proportion that 
remains in that pool and the proportion that is transferred to other pools.  A small number of transfers are 
possible, and are outlined in a disturbance matrix in Table 5.7.  The disturbance matrix ensures consistency of 
the accounting of all carbon pools. 
Biomass transfers to dead wood and litter can be estimated using Equation 2.20. 
Tier 3 
The Tier 3 method is similar to Tier 2, with the following distinctions: i) rather than relying on average annual 
rates of conversion, countries can use direct estimates of spatially disaggregated areas converted annually for 
each initial and final land use; ii) carbon densities and soil carbon stock change are based on locally specific 
information, which makes possible a dynamic link between biomass and soil; and iii) biomass volumes are based 
on actual inventories. The transfer of biomass, to dead wood and litter following land-use conversion can be 
estimated using Equation 2.20.

CHOICE OF EMISSION/REMOVAL FACTORS 
The emission/removal factors needed for the default method are: carbon stocks before conversion in the initial 
land use and after conversion to Cropland; and growth in biomass carbon stock from one year of cropland 
growth. 
Tier 1 
Default biomass carbon stock in initial land-use categories (BBEFORE) mainly Forest Land and Grassland are 
provided in Table 5.8. Initial land-use based carbon stocks should be obtained for different Forest Land or 
Grassland categories based on biome type, climate, soil management systems, etc. It is assumed that all biomass 
is cleared when preparing a site for cropland use, thus, the default for BAFTER is 0 tonne C ha-1.  
In addition, a value is needed for carbon stocks after one year of growth in crops planted after conversion (ŒîCG). 
Table 5.9 provides defaults for ŒîCG. Separate defaults are provided for annual non-woody crops and perennial 
woody crops. For lands planted in annual crops, the default value of ŒîCG is 5 tonnes of C per hectare, based on 
the original IPCC Guidelines recommendation of 10 tonnes of dry biomass per hectare (dry biomass has been 
converted to tonnes carbon in Table 5.9). The total accumulation of carbon in perennial woody biomass will, 
over time, exceed that of the default carbon stock for annual cropland. However, default values provided in this 
section are for one year of growth immediately following conversion, which usually give lower carbon stocks for 
perennial woody crops compared to annual crops.

Tier 2 
Tier 2 methods should include some country-specific estimates for biomass stocks and removals due to land 
conversion, and also include estimates of on-site and off-site losses due to burning and decay following land 
conversion to Cropland. These improvements can take the form of systematic studies of carbon content and 
emissions and removals associated with land uses and land-use conversions within the country and a re-
examination of default assumptions in light of country-specific conditions.  
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.29 
Default parameters for emissions from burning and decay are provided. However, countries are encouraged to 
develop country-specific coefficients to improve the accuracy of estimates. The IPCC Guidelines use a general 
default of 0.5 for the proportion of biomass burnt on-site for both Forest Land and Grassland conversions. 
Research studies suggest that the fraction is highly variable and could be as low as 0.2 (Fearnside, 2000; Barbosa 
and Fearnside, 1996; and Fearnside, 1990). Updated default proportions of biomass burnt on-site are provided in 
Chapter 4 (Forest Land) for a range of forest vegetation classes. These defaults should be used for transitions 
from Forest Land to Cropland. For non-forest initial land uses, the default proportion of biomass left on-site and 
burnt is 0.35. This default takes into consideration research, which suggests the fraction should fall within the 
range 0.2 to 0.5 (e.g., Fearnside, 2000; Barbosa and Fearnside, 1996; and Fearnside, 1990). It is good practice 
for countries to use 0.35 or another value within this range, provided that the rationale for the choice is 
documented. There is no default value for the amount of biomass taken off-site and burnt; countries will need to 
develop a proportion based on national data sources. In Chapter 4 (Forest Land), the default proportion of 
biomass oxidized as a result of burning is 0.9, as originally stated in the GPG-LULUCF. 
The method for estimating emissions from decay assumes that all biomass decays over a period of 10 years. For 
reporting purposes countries have two options: 1) report all emissions from decay in one year, recognizing that 
in reality they occur over a 10 year period, and 2) report all emission from decay on an annual basis, estimating 
the rate as one tenth of the totals. If countries choose the latter option, they should add a multiplication factor of 
0.10 to the equation. 
Tier 3 
Under Tier 3, all parameters should be country-defined using measurements and monitoring for more accurate 
values rather than the defaults. Process based models and decay functions can also be used. 
5.3.1.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
All tiers require estimates of land areas converted to Cropland. The same area estimates should be used for both 
biomass and soil C calculations on Land Converted to Cropland. Higher tiers require greater specificity of areas. 
At a minimum, the area of Forest Land and natural Grassland converted to Cropland should be identified 
separately for all tiers. This implies at least some knowledge of the land uses prior to conversion. This may also 
require expert judgment if Approach 1 in Chapter 3 of these guidelines is used for land area identification.  
Tier 1 
Separate estimates are required of areas converted to Cropland from initial land uses (i.e., Forest Land, 
Grassland, Settlements, etc.) to final crop land type (i.e., annual or perennial) (ATO_OTHERS). For example, 
countries should estimate separately the area of tropical moist forest converted to annual cropland, tropical moist 
forest converted to perennial cropland, tropical moist Grassland converted to perennial cropland, etc. Although, 
to allow other pools to equilibrate and for consistency with land area estimation overall, land areas should 
remain in the conversion category for 20 years (or other period reflecting national circumstances) following 
conversion. The methodology assumes that area estimates are based on a one-year time frame, which is likely to 
require estimation on the basis of average rates on land-use conversion, determined by measurements estimates 
made at longer intervals. If countries do not have these data, partial samples may be extrapolated to the entire 
land base or historic estimates of conversions may be extrapolated over time based on the judgement of country 
experts. Under Tier 1 calculations, international statistics such as FAO databases, IPCC GPG Reports and other 
sources, supplemented with sound assumptions, can be used to estimate the area of Land Converted to Cropland 
from each initial land use. For higher tier calculations, country-specific data sources are used to estimate all 
possible transitions from initial land use to final crop type. 
Tier 2 
It is good practice for countries to use actual area estimates for all possible transitions from initial land use to 
final crop type. Full coverage of land areas can be accomplished either through analysis of periodic remotely 
sensed images of land-use and land cover patterns, through periodic ground-based sampling of land-use patterns, 
or hybrid inventory systems. If finer resolution country-specific data are partially available, countries are 
encouraged to use sound assumptions from best available knowledge to extrapolate to the entire land base. 
Historic estimates of conversions may be extrapolated over time based on the judgment of country experts.  
Tier 3 
Activity data used in Tier 3 calculations should be a full accounting of all land-use transitions to Cropland and be 
disaggregated to account for different conditions within a country. Disaggregation can occur along political 
(county, province, etc.), biome, climate, or on a combination of such parameters. In many cases, countries may 
have information on multi-year trends in land conversion (from periodic sample-based or remotely sensed 
inventories of land use and land cover). Periodic land-use change matrix need to be developed giving the initial 
and final land-use areas at disaggregated level based on remote sensing and field surveys.

CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIERS 1 AND 2  
The following summarizes steps for estimating change in carbon stocks in 
biomass (‚àÜCB ) using the default methods 
Using the worksheet provided for Land Converted to Cropland (see Annex 1, AFOLU Worksheets), calculate 
the change in biomass carbon stocks in Land Converted to Cropland as follows:  
Step 1: Enter the subcategories of croplands for the reporting year. The subcategories of croplands used in 
Section 5.2 may also be used to fill out the appropriate column in the worksheet. 
Step 2: For each sub-category, enter the annual area of land converted to Cropland (ATO_OTHERS). Data for 
annual area may be obtained from various sources such as the Ministry of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, 
Ministry of Planning, or Mapping Office within a country. 
Step 3: For each sub-category, enter the carbon stocks in biomass immediately after conversion to Cropland 
(BAFTER), in tonnes C ha-1. Biomass and carbon data may be default values or country-specific values. 
Step 4: For each sub-category, enter the carbon stocks in biomass immediately before conversion to Cropland 
(BBEFORE), in tonnes C ha-1. Biomass and carbon data may be default values or country-specific values. 
Step 5: Calculate the carbon stocks change per area (CCONVERSION) for the type of conversion when land is 
converted to Cropland (Equation 2.16).  
Step 6: Obtain the values for change in carbon stocks from one year of cropland growth (ŒîCG) and the decrease 
in biomass carbon due to losses ((ŒîCL) using Table 5.1.  Enter the values in the appropriate column.  
Step 7: Calculate the annual change in carbon stocks in biomass in Land Converted to Cropland (ŒîCB) using 
Equation 2.15.  
Step 8: Sum up all the annual changes in carbon stocks in biomass. 
5.3.1.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Tier 1 
The sources of uncertainty in this method are from the use of global or national average rates of conversion and 
from estimates of land areas converted to Cropland. In addition, reliance on default parameters for carbon stocks 
in initial and final conditions contributes to relatively high degrees of uncertainty. The default values in this 
method have error ranges associated with them. A published compilation of research on carbon stocks in 
agroforestry systems was used to derive the default data provided in Section 5.2 (Schroeder, 1994). While 
defaults were derived from multiple studies, their associated uncertainty ranges were not included in the 
publication. Therefore, a default uncertainty level of +75% of the carbon stock has been assumed based on 
expert judgement. Land Converted to Cropland is likely to be a key source category for many countries and all 
efforts should be made to reduce uncertainty.  
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 method uses at least some country-defined defaults, which will improve the accuracy of estimates, 
because they better represent conditions relevant to the country. Use of country-specific values should entail 
sufficient sample sizes and or use of expert judgment to estimate uncertainties. This, together with uncertainty 
estimates on activity data derived using the advice in Chapter 3, should be used in the approaches to uncertainty 
analysis as described in Volume 1, Chapter 3 of this report.  
Tier 3 
Activity data from a land-use and management inventory system should provide a basis to assign estimates of 
uncertainty to areas associated with land-use changes. Combining emission and activity data and their associated 
uncertainties can be done using Monte-Carlo procedures to estimate means and confidence intervals for the 
overall inventory. The uncertainty is likely to be less than for other tiers since estimates of carbon stock changes 
are based on more measurements and more refined models.  
5.3.2 
Dead organic matter 
Forest Land, Grassland, Settlements, and other land-use categories could be potentially converted to Cropland 
which, in general will have little or no dead wood or litter, with the exception of agroforestry systems.  Methods 
are provided for two types of dead organic matter pools: 1) dead wood, and 2) litter. Chapter 1of this report 
provides detailed definitions of these pools.  
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.31 
Dead wood is a diverse pool which is difficult to measure, with associated uncertainties about rates of transfer to 
litter, soil, or emissions to the atmosphere.  
Litter accumulation depends on litterfall, which includes all leaves, twigs and small branches, fruits, flowers, and 
bark, minus the rate of decomposition. The litter mass is also influenced by the time since the last disturbance, 
and the type of disturbance. During the early stages of cropland development, litter increases rapidly. 
Management such as vegetation harvesting and burning dramatically alter litter stocks, but there are very few 
studies clearly documenting the effects of management on litter carbon. 
In general, croplands will have little or no dead wood or litter, and therefore these pools can often be assumed to 
approach zero after conversion, the exception being agroforestry systems which may be accounted either under 
Cropland or Forest Land, depending upon definitions adopted by countries for reporting. It is likely that the same 
will be true of many land uses prior to conversion, so that corresponding carbon pools prior to conversion can 
also be assumed to be zero.  The exceptions are forest, agro-forests, and wetlands converted to Cropland, which 
could have significant carbon in DOM pools, as well as forest areas around settlements that may have been 
defined as Settlements based on nearby use rather than land cover. 
Estimating change in carbon stocks in DOM for lands converted to Cropland under higher tiers requires a two-
phase approach.  During the first phase, there is often an abrupt change in DOM associated with the land-use 
change, particularly then the change is deliberate and associated with land preparation operations (e.g., clearing 
and burning).  The second phase accounts for decay and accumulation processes during a transition period to a 
new steady-state system. At some point in time, the cropland ecosystem should reach an equilibrium at which 
time it can be considered Cropland Remaining Cropland and accounted for under that category.  The transition 
period should be 20 years, but some countries can determine the appropriate transition period more accurately at 
higher tiers.     
To account for the transition period, lands converted to Cropland should be treated as annual cohorts. That is, 
land converted in a given year should be accounted for with Phase 1 methods in the year of conversion, and with 
Phase 2 methods for the subsequent 19 years.  At the end of the 20 year period, the land area for that given year 
is added to the land area being accounted under the Cropland Remaining Cropland category.  
5.3.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The decision tree in Figure 2.3 in Chapter 2 provides assistance in the selection of the appropriate tier level for 
the implementation of estimation procedures.  Estimation of changes in carbon stocks in DOM requires an 
estimate of changes in stocks of dead wood and changes in litter stocks (refer to Equation 2.17 in Chapter 2). 
Each of the DOM pools (dead wood and litter) is to be treated separately, but the method for each pool is the 
same. 
Tier 1 
A Tier 1 approach involves estimating the area of each type of land conversion using only the major conversion 
categories (e.g., Forest Land to Cropland).  The immediate and abrupt carbon stock change (Phase 1) in dead 
wood and litter due to conversion of other lands to Cropland under Tier 1 will be estimated using Equation 2.23 
in Chapter 2. C0 in Equation 2.23 is likely to be zero and there is no need to divide Ton.  The Tier 1 default 
assumes removal of all dead wood and litter during conversion and that there is no dead wood or litter that 
remains or accumulates in Land Converted to Cropland. Countries where this assumption is known to be false 
(e.g., where slash and burn agriculture is widely practiced) are encouraged to use a higher tier when accounting 
for lands converted to Cropland.  Additionally, it is assumed that croplands achieve their steady-state biomass 
during the first year following conversion.  Thus, for Tier 1, Phase 2 has no transition period and lands converted 
to Cropland are transferred to Cropland Remaining Cropland in the second year following conversion.    
There are no default values available for dead wood or litter in most systems.  For forests, there are no global 
default values for dead wood, but there are values for litter (Table 2.2 in Chapter 2). These values are in terms of 
tonnes C ha-1, not in terms of litter stocks.  Countries should make best estimates and use local data from forestry 
and agricultural research institutes to provide best estimates of the dead wood and litter in the initial system prior 
to conversion.   
Tier 2 
Tier 2 approaches require greater disaggregation than that used in Tier 1.  Activity data should be reported by 
management regimes.  Tier 2 also employs the two-phase approach described above. 
As recommended above in the biomass section, the immediate impacts of land conversion activities on the five 
carbon stocks can be summarized in a disturbance matrix. The disturbance matrix describes the retention, 
transfers and releases of carbon in the pools in the original ecosystem following conversion to Cropland. A 
disturbance matrix defines the proportion of the carbon stock that remains in that pool and the proportion that is 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.32 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
transferred to other pools.  A small number of transfers are possible, and are outlined in the disturbance matrix in 
Table 5.7.  Use of a disturbance matrix ensures consistency of the accounting of all carbon pools.   
The immediate and abrupt carbon stock change in dead wood due to conversion of other lands to Cropland under 
Tiers 2 and 3 will be estimated using Equation 2.23 in Chapter 2 as suggested in Tier 1.   During the transition 
period, pools that gain or lose carbon often have a non-linear loss or accumulation curve that can be represented 
through successive transition matrices.  For Tier 2, a linear change function can be assumed; a Tier 3 approach 
based upon this method should use the true shapes of the curves. These curves should be applied to each cohort 
that is under transition during the reporting year to estimate the annual change in the dead wood and litter carbon 
pools.     
For the calculation of changes in dead wood and litter carbon during the transition phase, two methods are 
suggested:  
Method 1 (Also called the Gain-Loss Method, Equation 2.18 in Chapter 2):  Method 1 involves estimating the 
area of each type of land conversion and the average annual transfer into and out of dead wood and litter stocks. 
This requires an estimate of area under Land Converted to Cropland according to different climate or cropland 
types, management regime, or other factors significantly affecting dead wood and litter carbon pools and the 
quantity of biomass transferred into dead wood and litter stocks as well as the quantity of biomass transferred out 
of the dead wood and litter stocks on per hectare basis according to different cropland types.  
Method 2 (Also called the Stock-Difference Method, Equation 2.19 in Chapter 2):  Method 2 involves 
estimating the area of Land Converted to Cropland and then estimating dead wood and litter stocks at two 
periods of time, t1 and t2. The dead wood and litter stock changes for the inventory year are obtained by dividing 
the stock changes by the period (years) between two measurements. The stock difference method is feasible for 
countries, which have periodic inventories. This method is more suitable for countries adopting Tier 3 methods. 
Tier 3 methods are used where countries have country-specific emission factors, and substantial national data. 
Country-defined methodology may be based on detailed inventories of permanent sample plots for their 
croplands and/or models. 
Tier 3 
For Tier 3, countries should develop their own methodologies and parameters for estimating changes in DOM. 
These methodologies may be derived from both methods specified above, or may be based on other approaches.  
The method used needs to be clearly documented. 
Method 2 may be suitable for countries adopting Tier 3 methods. Tier 3 methods are used where countries have 
country-specific emission factors, and substantial national data. Country-defined methodology may be based on 
detailed inventories of permanent sample plots for their grasslands and/or models. 
5.3.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION/REMOVAL FACTORS 
Carbon Fraction:  The carbon fraction of dead wood and litter is variable and depends on the stage of 
decomposition.  Wood is much less variable than litter and a value of 0.50 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 can be used for 
the carbon fraction.   
Tier 1 
For Tier 1, it is assumed that the dead wood and litter carbon stocks in lands converted to Cropland are all lost 
during the conversion and that there is no accumulation of new DOM in the Cropland after conversion. 
Countries experiencing significant conversions of other ecosystems to Cropland that have a significant 
component of dead wood or litter (e.g., slash and burn systems for clearing land, agroforestry, etc.) are 
encouraged to develop domestic data to quantify this impact and report it under Tier 2 or 3 methodologies. 
Tier 2 
It is good practice to use country-level data on dead wood and litter for different Cropland categories, in 
combination with default values, if country or regional values are not available for some conversion categories. 
Country-specific values for transfer of carbon from live trees and other crops that are harvested to harvest 
residues and decomposition rates, in the case of Method 1 (Gain-Loss Method), or the net change in DOM pools, 
in the case of Method 2 (Stock-Difference Method), can be derived from domestic expansion factors, taking into 
account the Cropland type, the rate of biomass utilization, harvesting practices and the amount of damaged 
vegetation during harvesting operations. Country-specific values for disturbance regimes should be derived from 
scientific studies.  
Tier 3 
National level disaggregated DOM carbon estimates should be determined as part of a national land-use 
inventory, national level models, or from a dedicated greenhouse gas inventory programme, with periodic 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.33 
sampling according to the principles set our in Chapter 3 Annex 3A.3. Inventory data can be coupled with 
modelling studies to capture the dynamics of all Cropland carbon pools.  
Tier 3 methods provide estimates of greater certainty than lower tiers and feature a greater link between 
individual carbon pools. Some countries have developed disturbance matrices that provide a carbon reallocation 
pattern among different pools for each type of disturbance. Other important parameters in a modelled DOM 
carbon budget are decay rates, which may vary with the type of wood and microclimatic conditions, and site 
preparation procedures (e.g., controlled broadcast burning, or burning of piles).  
5.3.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Activity data should be consistent with the activity data used for estimating changes in biomass on land areas 
converted to Cropland. This can be obtained, consistent with the general principles set out in Chapter 3 and as 
described earlier through national statistics, from forest services, conservation agencies, municipalities, survey 
and mapping agencies. Cross-checks should be made to ensure complete and consistent representation of 
annually converted lands in order to avoid possible omissions or double counting. Data should be disaggregated 
according to the general climatic categories and Cropland types. Tier 3 inventories will require more 
comprehensive information on the establishment of new croplands, with refined soil classes, climates, and spatial 
and temporal resolution. All changes having occurred over the number of years selected as the transition period 
should be included with transitions older than the transition period (default 20 years) reported as a subdivision of 
Cropland Remaining Cropland.  
All tiers require estimates of land areas converted to Cropland. The same area data should be used for biomass 
calculations, dead organic matter and the soil carbon estimates. If necessary, area data used in the soils analysis 
can be aggregated to match the spatial scale required for lower order estimates of biomass; however, at higher 
tiers, stratification should take account of major soil types. Area data should be obtained using the methods 
described in Chapter 3. Higher tiers require greater detail but the minimum requirement for inventories to be 
consistent with the IPCC Guidelines is that the areas of forest conversion can be identified separately. This is 
because forest will usually have higher carbon density before conversion. This implies that at least partial 
knowledge of the land-use change matrix, and therefore, where Approaches 1 and 2 from Chapter 3 are used to 
estimate land area are being used, supplementary surveys may be needed to identify the area of land being 
converted from Forest Land to Cropland. As pointed out in Chapter 3, where surveys are being set up, it will 
often be more accurate to determine directly areas undergoing conversion, than to estimate these from the 
differences in total land areas under particular uses at different times.  
5.3.2.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIERS 1 AND 2 
Tier 1 
Step 1: Determine the categories of land conversion to be used in this assessment and the representative area of 
conversion by year (Aon). Area data should be obtained using the methods described in Chapter 3. Higher tiers 
require greater detail but the minimum requirement for inventories to be consistent with the IPCC Guidelines 
when using Tier 1 is that the areas of Forest Land conversion to Cropland can be identified separately.  
Step 2: For each activity category, determine the dead wood and litter stocks (separately) per hectare prior to 
conversion (ŒîCo).  
Step 3: For each activity category, determine the stocks in the dead wood and litter (separately) per hectare for 
the particular type of cropland after conversion (ŒîCn).  For Tier 1, dead wood and litter stocks following 
conversion are assumed to be equal to zero.   
Step 4: Calculate the net change of dead wood and litter stocks per hectare for each type of conversion by 
subtracting the initial stocks from the final stocks.  A negative value indicates a loss in the stock. 
Step 5: Convert the net change in the individual stock to units of tonnes C ha-1 by multiplying the net stock 
change by the carbon fraction of that stock (0.40 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 for litter, and 0.50 tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1 
for dead wood). 
Step 6: Multiply the net change in each C stock by the area converted during the reporting year, to get the 
annual change in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter (ŒîCDOM).

5.3.2.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT  
This section considers source-specific uncertainties relevant to estimates made for lands converted to Cropland. 
Sources of uncertainty include the degree of accuracy in land area estimates, carbon increase and loss, carbon 
stock, fraction of land area burnt, and expansion factor terms. Error estimates (i.e., standard deviations, standard 
error, or ranges) must be calculated for each of the country-defined terms used in a basic uncertainty assessment.  
Emission factor uncertainties 
These will be the same as the uncertainties associated with estimation of the litter and dead organic matter stocks 
per unit area on the previous land use. Uncertainties need not be estimated where zero carbon density in litter 
and dead organic matter pools is assumed for Cropland. Where this is not the case, uncertainties should be 
assessed by analysis of local data and should both exceed a factor of about 2. 
Activity data uncertainties 
Area data and estimates of uncertainty should be obtained using the methods in Chapter 3. Tiers 2 and 3 
approaches may also use higher resolution activity data, such as area estimates for different climatic regions or 
for cropland management systems within national boundaries. This will reduce uncertainty levels when 
associated with carbon accumulation factors defined at the same resolution.  
5.3.3 
Soil carbon 
Land is typically converted to Cropland from native lands, managed Forest Land and Grassland, but occasionally 
conversions can occur from Wetlands and seldom Settlements.  Regardless of soil type (i.e., mineral or organic), 
the conversion of land to Cropland will, in most cases, result in a loss of soil C for some years following 
conversion (Mann, 1986; Armentano and Menges, 1986; Davidson and Ackerman, 1993). Possible exceptions 
are irrigation of formerly arid lands and conversion of degraded lands to Cropland.  
General information and guidance for estimating changes in soil C stocks are provided in Section 2.3.3 of 
Chapter 2 (including equations), and that section needs to be read before proceeding with a consideration of 
specific guidelines dealing with cropland soil C stocks. The total change in soil C stocks for Land Converted to 
Cropland is estimated using Equation 2.24 (Chapter 2), which combines the change in soil organic C stocks 
(SOC stocks) for mineral soils and organic soils; and stock changes associated with soil inorganic C pools (Tier 
3 only).  This section provides specific guidance for estimating soil organic C stock changes; see Section 2.3.3.1 
for discussion on soil inorganic C (no additional guidance is provided in the Cropland section below). 
To account for changes in soil C stocks associated with Land Converted to Cropland, countries need to have, at a 
minimum, estimates of the areas of Land Converted to Cropland during the inventory time period. If land-use 
and management data are limited, aggregate data, such as FAO statistics, can be used as a starting point, along 
with knowledge of country experts of the approximate distribution of land-use types being converted and their 
associated management. If the previous land uses and conversions are not unknown, SOC stocks changes can 
still be computed using the methods provided in Cropland Remaining Cropland, but the land base area will 
likely be different for croplands in the current year relative to the initial year in the inventory.  It is critical, 
however, that the total land area across all land-use sectors be equal over the inventory time period (e.g., 7 
million ha may be converted from Forest Land and Grassland to Cropland during the inventory time period, 
meaning that croplands will have an additional 7 Million ha in the last year of the inventory, while grasslands 
and forests will have a corresponding loss of 7 Million ha in the last year).  Land Converted to Cropland is 
stratified according to climate regions and major soil types, which could either be based on default or country-
specific classifications. This can be accomplished with overlays of climate and soil maps, coupled with spatially-
explicit data on the location of land conversions. 
5.3.3.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Inventories can be developed using a Tier 1, 2 or 3 approach with each successive tier requiring more detail and 
resources than the previous one.  It is also possible that countries will use different tiers to prepare estimates for 
the separate subcategories of soil C (i.e., soil organic C stocks changes in mineral soils and organic soils; and 
stock changes associated with soil inorganic C pools).  Decision trees are provided for mineral soils (Figure 2.4) 
and organic soils (Figure 2.5) in Section 2.3.3.1 (Chapter 2) to assist inventory compilers with selection of the 
appropriate tier for their soil C inventory. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.36 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
Soil organic C stock changes for mineral soils can be estimated for land-use conversion to Cropland using 
Equation 2.25 in Chapter 2.  For Tier 1, the initial (pre-conversion) soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) and C stock in 
the last year of the inventory time period (SOC0) are computed from the default reference soil organic C stocks 
(SOCREF) and default stock change factors (FLU, FMG, FI).  Annual rates of stock changes are estimated as the 
difference in stocks (over time) divided by the time dependence (D) of the Cropland stock change factors 
(default is 20 years).   
Tier 2 
The Tier 2 method for mineral soils also uses Equation 2.25 in Chapter 2, but incorporates country-specific 
reference C stocks and/or stock change factors, and possibly more disaggregated land-use activity and 
environmental data.   
Tier 3 
Tier 3 methods will involve more detailed and country-specific models and/or measurement-based approaches 
along with highly disaggregated land-use and management data. Tier 3 approaches estimate soil C change from 
land-use conversions to Cropland, and may employ models, data sets and/or monitoring networks.  If possible, it 
is recommended that Tier 3 methods be integrated with estimates of biomass removal and the post-clearance 
treatment of plant residues (including woody debris and litter), as variation in the removal and treatment of 
residues (e.g., burning, site preparation) will affect C inputs to soil organic matter formation and C losses 
through decomposition and combustion. It is important that models be evaluated with independent observations 
from country-specific or region-specific field locations that are representative of the interactions of climate, soil 
and cropland management on post-conversion change in soil C stocks. 
Organic soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
Land Converted to Cropland on organic soils within the inventory time period is treated the same as long-term 
cropped organic soils. Carbon losses are computed using Equation 2.26 (Chapter 2). Additional guidance on the 
Tiers 1 and 2 approaches are given in the Cropland Remaining Cropland section (Section 5.2.3). 
Tier 3 
A Tier 3 approach will involve more detailed and country-specific models and/or measurement-based 
approaches along with highly disaggregated land-use and management data (see mineral soils above for further 
discussion).   
5.3.3.2 
CHOICE OF STOCK CHANGE AND EMISSION FACTORS 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 
For native unmanaged land, as well as for managed forest lands, settlements and nominally managed grasslands 
with low disturbance regimes, soil C stocks are assumed equal to the reference values (i.e., land-use, disturbance 
(forests only), management and input factors equal 1), while it will be necessary to apply the appropriate stock 
change factors to represent previous land-use systems that are not the reference condition, such as improved and 
degraded grasslands.  It will also be necessary to apply the appropriate stock change factor to represent input and 
management effects on soil C storage in the new cropland system.  Default reference C stocks are found in Table 
2.3 (Chapter 2).  See the appropriate land-use chapter for default stock change factors. 
In the case of transient land-use conversions to Cropland, the stock change factors are given in Table 5.10, and 
depend on the length of the fallow (vegetation recovery) cycle in a shifting cultivation system, representing an 
average soil C stock over the crop-fallow cycle. Mature fallow denotes situations where the non-cropland 
vegetation (e.g., forests) recovers to a mature or near mature state prior to being cleared again for cropland use, 
whereas in shortened fallow, vegetation recovery is not attained prior to re-clearing. If land already in shifting-
cultivation is converted to permanent Cropland (or other land uses), the stock change factors representing 
shifting cultivation would provide the ‚Äòinitial‚Äô C stocks (SOC(0-T)) in the calculations using Equation 2.25 
(Chapter 2).

Tier 2 
Estimation of country-specific stock change factors is probably the most important development associated with 
the Tier 2 approach.  Differences in soil organic C stocks among land uses are computed relative to a reference 
condition, using land-use factors (FLU).  Input factors (FI) and management factors (FMG) are then used to further 
refine the C stocks of the new cropland system.  Additional guidance on how to derive these stock change factors 
is given in Croplands Remaining Croplands, Section 5.2.3.2. See the appropriate chapter for specific information 
regarding the derivation of stock change factors for other land-use categories (Forest Land in Section 4.2.3.2, 
Grassland in 6.2.3.2, Settlements in 8.2.3.2, and Other Land in 9.3.3.2).  
Reference C stocks can also be derived from country-specific data in a Tier 2 approach.  However, reference 
values should be consistent across the land uses (i.e., Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Settlements, Other 
Land), and thus must be coordinated among the various teams conducting soil C inventories for AFOLU.   
Tier 3 
Constant stock change rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more 
accurately capture land-use and management effects. See Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1 for further discussion.  
Organic soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
Land Converted to Cropland on organic soils within the inventory time period is treated the same as long-term 
cropped organic soils. Tier 1 emission factors are given in Table 5.6, while Tier 2 emission factors are derived 
from country-specific or region-specific data.  
Tier 3 
Constant emission rate factors per se are less likely to be estimated in favor of variable rates that more accurately 
capture land-use and management effects.  See Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1 for further discussion.   
5.3.3.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Mineral soils 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 
For purposes of estimating soil carbon stock change, area estimates of Land Converted to Cropland should be 
stratified according to major climate regions and soil types. This can be based on overlays with suitable climate 
and soil maps and spatially-explicit data of the location of land conversions. Detailed descriptions of the default 
climate and soil classification schemes are provided in Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5. Specific information is provided 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.38 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
in the each of the land-use chapters regarding treatment of land-use/management activity data (Forest Land in 
Section 4.2.3.3, Cropland in 5.2.3.3, Grassland in 6.2.3.3, Settlements in 8.2.3.3, and Other Land in 9.3.3.3).   
One critical issue in evaluating the impact of Land Converted to Cropland on soil organic C stocks is the type of 
land-use and management activity data.  Activity data gathered using Approach 2 or 3 (see Chapter 3 for 
discussion about approaches) provide the underlying basis for determining the previous land use for Land 
Converted to Cropland.  In contrast, aggregate data (Approach 1, Chapter 3) only provide the total amount of 
area in each land at the beginning and end of the inventory period (e.g., 1985 and 2005).  Approach 1 data are 
not sufficient to determine specific transitions. In this case all Cropland will be reported in the Cropland 
Remaining Cropland category and in effect transitions become step changes across the landscape. This makes it 
particularly important to achieve coordination among all land sectors to ensure that the total land base is 
remaining constant over time, given that some land area will be lost and gained within individual sectors during 
each inventory year due to land-use change. 
Tier 3 
For application of dynamic models and/or a direct measurement-based inventory in Tier 3, similar or more 
detailed data on the combinations of climate, soil, topographic and management data are needed, relative to Tier 
1 or 2 methods, but the exact requirements will be dependent on the model or measurement design.    
Organic soils 
Tiers 1 and 2 
Land Converted to Cropland on organic soils within the inventory time period is treated the same as long-term 
cropped organic soils, and guidance on activity data is discussed in Section 5.2.3.3.  
Tier 3 
Similar to mineral soils, Tier 3 approaches will likely require more detailed data on the combinations of climate, 
soil, topographic and management data. Relative to Tier 1 or 2 methods, the exact requirements will be 
dependent on the model or measurement design.  
5.3.3.4 
CALCULATION STEPS FOR TIER 1 
Mineral soils 
The steps for estimating SOC0 and SOC(0-T) and net soil C stock change per ha of Land Converted to Cropland 
on mineral soils are as follows: 
Step 1: Organize data into inventory time periods based on the years in which activity data were collected (e.g., 
1990 to 1995, 1995 to 2000, etc.) 
Step 2: Determine the amount of Land Converted to Cropland by mineral soil types and climate regions in the 
country at the beginning of the first inventory time period.  The first year of the inventory time period will 
depend on the time step of the activity data (0-T; e.g., 5, 10 or 20 years ago). 
Step 3: For Grassland converted to Cropland, classify previous grasslands into the appropriate management 
system using Figure 6.1.  No classification is needed for other land uses at the Tier 1 level. 
Step 4: Assign native reference C stock values (SOCREF) from Table 2.3 based on climate and soil type.   
Step 5: Assign a land-use factor (FLU), management factor (FMG) and C input levels (FI) to each grassland based 
on the management classification (Step 2).  Values for FLU, FMG and FI are given in Table 6.2 for grasslands.  
Values are assumed to be 1 for all other land uses.  
Step 6: Multiply the factors (FLU, FMG, FI) by the reference soil C stock to estimate an ‚Äòinitial‚Äô soil organic C 
stock (SOC(0-T)) for the inventory time period.    
Step 7: Estimate the final soil organic C stock (SOC0) by repeating Steps 1 to 5 using the same native reference 
C stock (SOCREF), but with land-use, management and input factors that represent conditions for the cropland in 
the last (year 0) inventory year.  
Step 8: Estimate the average annual change in soil organic C stocks for land converted to Cropland (‚àÜCMineral) 
by subtracting the ‚Äòinitial‚Äô soil organic C stock (SOC(0-T)) from the final soil organic C stock (SOC0), and then 
dividing by the time dependence of the stock change factors (i.e., 20 years using the default factors).  Note: if an 
inventory time period is greater than 20 years, then divide by the difference in the initial and final year of the 
time period.  
Step 9: Repeat Steps 2 to 8 if there are additional inventory time periods (e.g., 1990 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, etc.).  
Note that Land Converted to Cropland will retain that designation for 20 years.  Therefore, inventory time 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.39 
periods that are less than 20 years may need to refer to the previous inventory time period to evaluate if a parcel 
of land is considered Land Converted to Cropland or Cropland Remaining Cropland. 
A numerical example is given below for Forest Land converted to Cropland on mineral soils, using Equation 
2.25 and default reference C stocks (Table 2.3) and stock change factors (Table 5.5). 
Example:    For a forest on volcanic soil in a tropical moist environment: SOCRef = 70 tonnes C  
ha-1. For all forest soils (and for native grasslands) default values for stock change factors (FLU , 
FMG , FI) are all 1; thus SOC(0-T) is 70 tonnes C ha-1. If the land is converted into annual cropland, 
with intensive tillage and low residue C inputs then SOC0 = 70 tonnes C ha-1 ‚óè 0.48 ‚óè 1 ‚óè 0.92 = 
30.9 tonnes C ha-1. Thus the average annual change in soil C stock for the area over the inventory 
time period is calculated as (30.9 tonnes C ha-1 ‚Äì 70 tonnes C ha-1) / 20 yrs =    -2.0 tonnes C ha-1 
yr-1.  
 
Organic soils 
Calculation steps and example are the same as described in Section 5.2.3.4 above. 
5.3.3.5 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Uncertainty analyses for Land Converted to Cropland are fundamentally the same as Cropland Remaining 
Cropland.  Three broad sources of uncertainty exists: 1) uncertainties in land-use and management activity and 
environmental data; 2) uncertainties in reference soil C stocks if using a Tier 1 or 2 approach (mineral soils only); 
and 3) uncertainties in the stock change/emission factors for Tier 1 or 2 approaches, model structure/parameter 
error for Tier 3 model-based approaches, or measurement error/sampling variability associated with a Tier 3 
measurement-based inventories.  See the uncertainty section in Cropland Remaining Cropland for additional 
discussion (Section 5.2.3.5). 
5.3.4 
Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from biomass 
burning 
Greenhouse gas emissions from conversion of non-cropland, particularly Forest Land and Grassland to Cropland, 
are likely to be key source category for many countries. Greenhouse gas emissions from Land Converted to 
Cropland occur from incomplete combustion of biomass and dead organic matter (DOM) in the initial land-use 
category before conversion. CO2 emissions are accounted for in the new land-use category (Land Converted to 
Cropland). The most significant non-CO2 emissions in this section arise from conversion of Forest Land to 
Cropland, but it may also occur as a result of the conversion from Grassland to Cropland. It is very unlikely that 
Cropland originates from conversion of the other land-use categories (Settlements, Wetlands, or Other Land).   
In the tropics, it is common practice to burn the forest residues successively, until most (or all) of the forest 
residues and DOM is cleared, and agriculture can be established. In some places, up to three or four burnings are 
necessary. Part of the above-ground forest biomass removed during the process of conversion of Forest Land to 
Cropland may be transferred to harvested wood products, and an amount may be removed from the site to be 
used as fuel wood (hence, burnt off-site). Whatever remains is normally burnt on-site. 
Methods for estimating CO2 emissions from fire for Land Converted to Cropland are described in Section 2.4 in 
Chapter 2. 
Non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning in unmanaged Forest Land, if followed by a land-use conversion, 
shall be reported, since the converted land is considered to be managed land. 
The approach to be used to estimate non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning in Land Converted to Cropland is 
essentially the same as for Cropland Remaining Cropland.  
5.3.4.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The decision tree in Figure 2.6 in Chapter 2 provides guidance on the choice of the Tier level to be applied by 
countries when reporting non-CO2 emissions from Land Converted to Cropland. Countries experiencing 
significant scale conversion of non-cropland, particularly from Forest Land, to cropland should strive to adopt 
Tier 2 or 3 methods.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.40 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The choice of method is directly related to the availability of national data on the area of converted land burnt, 
the mass of fuel available, and combustion and emission factors. When using higher tiers, country-specific data 
on the mass of available fuel is used to represent the amount of biomass removed for conversion, and transferred 
to harvested wood product (if applicable), removed for fuel use and burnt off-site.  
Countries should strive to report using a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method whenever greenhouse gas emissions from 
biomass burning in Land Converted to Cropland is a key category. If models have been developed and validated, 
countries should apply a Tier 3 method even in those cases where Land Converted to Cropland is not a key 
category. 
5.3.4.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1 
The mass of fuel combusted is critical for estimating greenhouse gas emissions. Default data to support 
estimation of emissions under a Tier 1 approach are given in Tables 2.4 ‚Äì 2.6 in Chapter 2. Countries need to 
judge how their vegetation types relate to the broad vegetation categories described in the default tables. For Tier 
1, it should be assumed that all of the carbon in above-ground biomass and DOM in the previous land category is 
lost immediately after conversion. Default values for biomass prior to conversion can be found in the chapters 
relating to the respective land uses (e.g., default factors for Forest Land are to be found in the chapter dealing 
with biomass in Forest Land). For calculation of non-CO2 emissions, estimates of the amount of fuel actually 
burnt (Table 2.4) should be used. 
Tier 2 
In a Tier 2 method, country-specific estimates of mass of fuel available should be used. Data should be 
disaggregated according to forest types, in the case of Forest Land converted to Cropland. Combustion and 
emission factors that reflect better the national conditions (climate zone, biome, burning conditions) should be 
developed and uncertainty ranges provided. In addition, unlike Tier 1, where it is assumed that all of the carbon 
in above-ground and DOM is lost immediately after conversion, in a Tier 2 method the transfers of biomass to 
harvested wood products and fuelwood (burnt off-site) should be estimated to provide a more reliable estimate of 
the mass of fuel available for combustion.  
Tier 3 
Under a Tier 3, all the parameters required for estimating CO2 and non-CO2 emissions should be developed 
nationally for different land types subjected to conversion to Cropland.   
5.3.4.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The activity data needed to estimate non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning refers to the area affected by this 
activity. Countries shall stratify the area converted to Cropland by Forest Land and Grassland converted, since 
the amount of fuel available for burning may present large variations from one category of land use to another. 
The most critical conversion is from Forest Land to Cropland, due to large biomass involved per hectare. It is 
good practice to ensure the area data used for non-CO2 estimation is consistent with that used for biomass and 
DOM sections.  
Tier 1 
Countries applying a Tier 1 method should estimate the areas converted to Cropland from initial land uses 
(Forest Land, Grassland, etc.). Countries using Approach 1 of Chapter 3 should strive to further stratify Land 
Converted to Cropland from different land-use categories. The conversion should be estimated on a yearly basis. 
Estimates can be derived by applying a rate of conversion to Cropland to the total area cropped annually. The 
rate can be estimated on the basis of historical knowledge, judgement of country experts, and/or from samples of 
converted areas and assessment of the final land use. Alternatively, estimates can be derived using data from 
international sources, such as FAO, to estimate the area of Forest Land and Grassland area annually converted, 
and using expert judgement to estimate the portion of this area converted to Cropland. 
Tier 2 
Countries should, where possible, use actual area estimates for all possible conversions to Cropland. Multi-
temporal remotely sensed data of adequate resolution should provide better estimates of land-use conversion 
than the approaches used in Tier 1. The analysis may be based on full coverage of the territory or on 
representative sample areas selected, from which estimates of the area converted to Cropland in the entire 
territory can be derived.  
Tier 3 
The activity data in Tier 3 should be based on the Approach 3 method presented in Chapter 3, where the total 
annual area converted to Cropland (from Forest Land, Grassland, or other land-use category) is estimated. It is 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.41 
good practice to develop a land-use change matrix as suggested in Chapter 3, in a spatially explicit manner. The 
data should be disaggregated according to type of biome, climate, soils, political boundaries, or a combination of 
these parameters.   
5.3.4.4 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Tier 1 
The sources of uncertainty arise from: (i) use of global or national average rates of conversion or coarse 
estimates of land areas converted to Cropland; (ii) estimate of the area converted that is burnt; (iii) mass of 
available fuel; and (iv) combustion and emission factors. Uncertainties associated with emission and combustion 
factors are provided, and those related to items (i) and (ii) can vary significantly depending on the method used 
in their estimation. 
As a result of these uncertainties it is unlikely that the estimate of area burnt will be known to better than 20% 
and the emissions per unit area to within a factor of 2 using Tier 1 methods. 
Tier 2 
The use of area estimates produced from more reliable sources (remotely sensed data, sample approach) will 
improve the accuracy relative to Tier 1 and Approach 1 of Chapter 3. These sources will also provide better 
estimates of the areas that are converted and burnt. Taking into account the biomass transferred to harvested 
wood products or removed from the site as fuelwood, and the biomass left on-site to decay, will eliminate a bias 
(overestimation) in the estimates. Estimates of emission or combustion factors, if accompanied by error ranges 
(in the form of standard deviation), will allow uncertainty associated with Land Converted to Cropland to be 
assessed.  
Tier 3 
Uncertainty is less and is dependent on the accuracy of remote sensing and field surveys, and of the modelling 
approach used and associated data inputs. 
5.4 
COMPLETENESS, TIME SERIES, QA/QC, AND 
REPORTING 
Material presented here supplements the general guidance on these issues that is provided in Volume 1. 
5.4.1 
Completeness 
Tier 1 
A complete Cropland inventory for Tier 1 has three elements: 1) carbon stock changes and non-CO2 (CH4, CO, 
N2O, NOx) emissions from biomass burning have been estimated for all Land Converted to Cropland and 
Cropland Remaining Cropland during the inventory time period, 2) inventory analysis addressed the impact of 
all management practices described in the Tier 1 methods, and 3) the analysis accounted for climatic and soil 
variation that impacts emissions and removals (as described for Tier 1).   
The latter two elements require assignment of management systems to cropland areas and stratification by 
climate regions and soil types.  It is good practice for countries to use the same area classifications for biomass 
and soil pools in addition to biomass burning (to the extent that classifications are needed for these source 
categories).  This will ensure consistency and transparency, allow for efficient use of land surveys and other data 
collection tools, and enable the explicit linking between carbon dioxide emissions and removals in biomass and 
soil pools, as well as non-CO2 emissions from biomass burning. 
For biomass and soil C stock estimations, a cropland inventory should address the impact of land-use change 
(Land Converted to Cropland) and management.  However, in some cases, activity data or expert knowledge 
may not be sufficient to estimate the effects of agroforestry, crop rotation practices, tillage practices, irrigation, 
manure application, residue management, etc.  In those cases, countries may proceed with an inventory 
addressing land use alone, but the results will be incomplete and omission of management practices must be 
clearly identified in the reporting documentation for purposes of transparency. If there are omissions, it is good 
practice to collect additional activity data for future inventories, particularly if biomass or soil C is a key source 
category.  
C stock changes may not be computed for some cropland areas if greenhouse gas emissions and removals are 
believed to be insignificant or constant through time, such as non-woody cropland where there are no 
management or land-use changes. In this case, it is good practice for countries to document and explain the 
reason for omissions.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.42 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
For biomass burning, non-CO2 greenhouse gases should be estimated for all major categories of crop residues, 
taking care to account for removal of residues from the field for other purposes such as energy production, and 
for losses of residues resulting from grazing and decomposition during the period between harvests and burning 
operations. Where there is conversion of Forest Land to Cropland, the emissions from the burning of DOM and 
cleared tree biomass should be included. 
Tier 2 
A complete Tier 2 inventory has similar elements as Tier 1 but incorporates country-specific data: to estimate C 
stock change factors, reference soil C stocks, residue estimates (fuel load), combustion and emission factors for 
biomass burning; and to develop climate descriptions and soil categories in addition to improve management 
system classifications.  Moreover, it is good practice for a Tier 2 inventory to incorporate country-specific data 
for each component.  Inventories are still considered complete, however, if they combine country- specific data 
with Tier 1 defaults.  
Tier 3 
In addition to the Tiers 1 and 2 considerations, completeness of Tier 3 inventories will depend on the 
components of the country-specific evaluation system.  In practice, Tier 3 inventories are likely to fully account 
for emissions and removals from croplands using more, finely resolved data on climate, soils, biomass burning 
and management systems.  It is good practice for inventory compilers to describe and document the elements of 
the country-specific system, demonstrating the completeness of the approach and data sources.  If gaps are 
identified, it is good practice to gather additional data and further develop the country-specific system. 
5.4.2 
Developing a consistent time series 
Tier 1 
Consistent time series are essential for evaluating trends in emissions or removals.  In order to maintain 
consistency, compilers should apply the same classifications and factors over the entire inventory time period, 
including climate, soil types, management system classifications, C stock change factors, reference soil C stocks, 
residue estimates (fuel load), combustion factors, and non-CO2 emission factors. Defaults are provided for all of 
these characteristics and so consistency should not be an issue.  In addition, the land base should also remain 
consistent through time, with the exception of Land Converted to Cropland or Cropland converted to other land 
uses. 
Countries should use consistent sources of activity data on land use, management and biomass burning, 
throughout the inventory.  Sampling approaches, if used, should be maintained for the duration of the inventory 
time period to ensure a consistent approach. If subcategories are created, countries should keep transparent 
records of how they are defined and apply them consistently throughout the inventory. 
In some cases, sources of activity data, definitions or methods may change over time with availability of new 
information. Inventory compilers should determine the influence of changing data or methods on trends, and if 
deemed significant, emissions and removals should be re-calculated for the time series using methods provided 
in Chapter 5 of Volume 1.   
For C stock changes, one key element in producing a consistent time series is to ensure consistency between C 
stocks for lands converted to Cropland that were reported in previous reporting periods and the state of those 
stocks reported for those lands that are remaining Cropland in the current reporting period.  For example, if 50 
tonnes of the above-ground live biomass was transferred to the dead organic matter pool for land converted from 
Forest Land to Cropland in the previous reporting period, reporting in this period must assume that the starting 
carbon stocks in the dead organic matter pool was 50 tonnes for those lands. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the issues discussed under Tier 1, there are additional considerations associated with introduction 
of country-specific information. Specifically, it is good practice to apply new values or classifications derived 
from country-specific information across the entire inventory and re-calculate the time series.  Otherwise, 
positive or negative trends in C stocks or biomass burning may be partly due to changes associated with the 
inventory methods at some point in the time series, and not representative of actual trends.   
It is possible that new country-specific information may not be available for the entire time series.  In those cases, 
it is good practice to demonstrate the effect of changes in activity levels versus updated country-specific data or 
methods. Guidance on recalculation for these circumstances is presented in Chapter 5 of Volume 1.  
Tier 3 
Similar to Tiers 1 and 2, it is good practice to apply the country-specific estimation system throughout the entire 
time series. Inventory agencies should use the same measurement protocols (sampling strategy, method, etc.) 
and/or model-based system throughout the inventory time period.  
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.43 
5.4.3 
Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
Tier 1 
It is good practice to implement Quality Assurance/Quality Controls with internal and external review of 
Cropland inventory data.  Internal reviews should be conducted by the agency in charge of the inventory, while 
external review is conducted by other agencies, experts or groups who are not directly involved with the 
compilation.  
Internal review should focus on the inventory implementation process to ensure that: 1) activity data have been 
stratified appropriately by climate regions and soil types; 2) management classifications/descriptions have been 
applied appropriately; 3) activity data have been properly transcribed into the worksheets or inventory 
computation software; and 4) C stock change factors, reference soil C stocks, residue estimates (fuel load), and 
biomass burning combustion and emission factors have been assigned appropriately.  Quality Assurance/Quality 
Control measures may involve visual inspection as well as built-in program functions to check data entry and 
results. Summary statistics can also be helpful, such as summing areas by strata within worksheets to determine 
if they are consistent with land-use statistics.  Total areas should remain constant over the inventory period, and 
areas by strata should only vary by land-use or management classification (climate and soil areas should remain 
constant).   
External reviews need to consider the validity of the inventory approach, thoroughness of inventory 
documentation, methods explanation and overall transparency. It is important to evaluate if the total area of 
cropland is realistic, and reviewers should cross-check area estimates across land-use categories (i.e., Forest 
Land, Cropland, Grassland, etc.) to ensure that the sum of the entire land base for a country is equal across every 
year in the inventory time period. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the Quality Assurance/Quality Controls measures under Tier 1, the inventory agency should 
review the country-specific climate regions, soil types, management system classifications, C stock change 
factors, reference C stocks, residue estimates (fuel load), combustion factors and/or non-CO2 emission factors for 
biomass burning.  If using factors based on direct measurements, the inventory agency should review the 
measurements to ensure that they are representative of the actual range of environmental and management 
conditions, and were developed according to recognized standards (IAEA, 1992). If accessible, it is good 
practice to compare country-specific factors with Tier 2 stock change and emission factors used by other 
countries with comparable circumstances, in addition to the IPCC defaults.   
Given the complexity of emission and removal trends, specialist in the field should be involved in the external 
review to critique the residue fuel load estimates, stock change factors, combustion and emission factors, as well 
as country-specific climate regions, soil types, and/or management system descriptions. 
Tier 3 
Country-specific inventory systems will likely need additional Quality Assurance/Quality Control measures, but 
this will be dependent on the systems that are developed.  It is good practice to develop a Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control protocol that is specific to the country‚Äôs advanced inventory system, archive the 
reports, and include summary results in reporting documentation. 
5.4.4 
Reporting and Documentation 
Tier 1 
In general, it is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national inventory 
estimates.  For Tier 1, inventory compilers should document activity data trends and uncertainties for croplands.  
Key activities include land-use change, use of mineral fertilizers, agroforestry practices, organic amendments, 
tillage management, cropping rotations, residue management (including burning), irrigation practices, extent of 
mixed cropping systems, water management in rice systems, and land-use change.   
It is good practice to archive actual databases, such as agricultural census data, and procedures used to process 
the data (e.g., statistical programs); definitions used to categorize or aggregate activity data; and procedures used 
to stratify activity data by climate regions and soil types (for Tier 1 and Tier 2). The worksheets or inventory 
software should be archived with input/output files that were generated to produce the results. 
In cases where activity data are not available directly from databases or multiple data sets were combined, the 
information, assumptions and procedures that were used to derive the activity data should be described. This 
documentation should include the frequency of data collection and estimation, and uncertainty.  Use of expert 
knowledge should be documented and correspondences archived.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
5.44 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
It is good practice to document and explain trends in biomass and soil C stocks, as well as biomass burning in 
terms of the land-use and management activity. Changes in biomass stocks should be linked directly to land use 
or changes in agroforestry practices, while trends in soil C stocks may be due to land use or shifts in key 
management activities, as described above.  Biomass burning emissions from residues will depend on the extent 
to which burning is used to prepare fields for planting.  Significant fluctuations in emissions between years 
should be explained.  
Countries need to include documentation on completeness of their inventory, issues related to time series 
consistency or lack thereof, and a summary of Quality Assurance/Quality Control measures and results. 
Tier 2 
In addition to the Tier 1 considerations, inventory compilers should document the underlying basis for country-
specific C stock change factors, reference soil C stocks, residue estimated (fuel loads), combustion and emission 
factors for biomass burning, management system classifications, climate regions and/or soil types.  Furthermore, 
it is good practice to archive metadata and data sources for information used to estimate country-specific values. 
Reporting documentation should include the country-specific factors (i.e., means and uncertainties). It is good 
practice to include a discussion in the inventory report about differences between country-specific factors and 
Tier 1 defaults as well as Tier 2 factors from regions with similar circumstances as the reporting country.  If 
different emission factors, parameters and methods are used for different years, the reasons for these changes 
should be explained and documented. In addition, inventory agencies should describe country-specific 
classifications of management, climate and/or soil types, and it is recommended that improvements in the 
inventory methods based on the new classifications be documented.  For example, tillage management practices 
may be subdivided into additional categories beyond the Tier 1 classes (i.e., reduced, no-till and full tillage), but 
further subdivisions will only improve inventory estimates if the stock change or emission factors differ 
significantly among the new categories.   
When discussing trends in emissions and removals, a distinction should be made between changes in activity 
levels and changes in methods from year to year, and the reasons for these changes need to be documented. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 inventory will need similar documentation about activity data and emission/removal trends as lower tier 
approaches, but additional documentation should be included to explain the underlying basis and framework of 
the country-specific estimation system. With measurement-based inventories, it is good practice to document the 
sampling design, laboratory procedures and data analysis techniques.  Measurement data should be archived, 
along with results from data analyses.  For Tier 3 approaches that use models, it is good practice to document the 
model version and provide a model description, as well as permanently archive copies of all model input files, 
source code and executable programs. 
5.5 
METHANE EMISSIONS FROM RICE 
CULTIVATION 
Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces methane (CH4), which escapes to 
the atmosphere primarily by transport through the rice plants (Takai, 1970; Cicerone and Shetter, 1981; Conrad, 
1989; Nouchi et al., 1990). The annual amount of CH4 emitted from a given area of rice is a function of the 
number and duration of crops grown, water regimes before and during cultivation period, and organic and 
inorganic soil amendments (Neue and Sass, 1994; Minami, 1995). Soil type, temperature, and rice cultivar also 
affect CH4 emissions. 
These new guidelines for computing CH4 emissions incorporate various changes as compared to the 1996 
Guidelines and the GPG2000, namely (i) revision of emission and scaling factors derived from updated analysis 
of available data, (ii) use of daily ‚Äì instead of seasonal ‚Äì emission factors to allow more flexibility in separating 
cropping seasons and fallow periods, (iii) new scaling factors for water regime before the cultivation period and 
timing of straw incorporation, and (iv) inclusion of Tier 3 approach in line with the general principles of the 
2006 revision of guidelines. The revised guidelines also maintain the separate calculation of N2O emission from 
rice cultivation (as one form of managed soil) which is dealt with in Chapter 11. 
5.5.1 
Choice of method 
The basic equation to estimate CH4 emissions from rice cultivation is shown in Equation 5.1. CH4 emissions are 
estimated by multiplying daily emission factors by cultivation period3 of rice and annual harvested areas4. In its 
                                                           
3 In the case of a ratoon crop, ‚Äòcultivation period‚Äô should be extended by the respective number of days. 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.45 
most simple form, this equation is implemented using national activity data (i.e., national average cultivation 
period of rice and area harvested) and a single emission factor. However, the natural conditions and agricultural 
management of rice production may be highly variable within a country. It is good practice to account for this 
variability by disaggregating national total harvested area into sub-units (e.g., harvested areas under different 
water regimes). Harvested area for each sub-unit is multiplied by the respective cultivation period and emission 
factor that is representative of the conditions that define the sub-unit (Sass, 2002). With this disaggregated 
approach, total annual emissions are equal to the sum of emissions from each sub-unit of harvested area.

The different conditions that should be considered include rice ecosystem type, flooding pattern before and 
during cultivation period, and type and amount of organic amendments. Other conditions such as soil type, and 
rice cultivar can be considered for the disaggregation if country-specific information about the relationship 
between these conditions and CH4 emissions are available. The rice ecosystem types and water regimes during 
cultivation period are listed in Table 5.12. If the national rice production can be subdivided into climatic zones 
with different production systems (e.g., flooding patterns), Equation 5.1 should be applied to each region 
separately. The same applies if rice statistics or expert judgments are available to distinguish management 
practices or other factors along administrative units (district or province). In addition, if more than one crop is 
harvested during a given year, emissions should be estimated for each cropping season taking into account 
possible differences in cultivation practice (e.g., use of organic amendments, flooding pattern before and during 
the cultivation period).  
The decision tree in Figure 5.2 guides inventory agencies through the process of applying the good practice 
IPCC approach. Implicit in this decision tree is a hierarchy of disaggregation in implementing the IPCC method. 
Within this hierarchy, the level of disaggregation utilised by an inventory agency will depend upon the 
availability of activity and emission factor data, as well as the importance of rice as a contributor to its national 
greenhouse gas emissions. The specific steps and variables in this decision tree, and the logic behind it, are 
discussed in the text that follows the decision tree. 
Tier 1 
Tier 1 applies to countries in which either CH4 emissions from rice cultivation are not a key category or country-
specific emission factors do not exist. The disaggregation of the annual harvest area of rice needs to be done for 
at least three baseline water regimes including irrigated, rainfed, and upland. It is encouraged to incorporate as 
many of the conditions (i, j, k, etc.) that influence CH4 emissions (summarized in Box 5.2) as possible. 
Emissions for each sub-unit are adjusted by multiplying a baseline default emission factor (for field with no pre-
season flooding for less than 180 days prior to rice cultivation and continuously flooded fields without organic 
amendments, EFc) by various scaling factors as shown in Equation 5.2. The calculations are carried out for each 
water regime and organic amendment separately as shown in Equation 5.1.  
                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 In case of multiple cropping during the same year, ‚Äòharvested area‚Äô is equal to the sum of the area cultivated for each 
cropping.

BOX 5.2 
CONDITIONS INFLUENCING CH4 EMISSIONS FROM RICE CULTIVATION 
The following rice cultivation characteristics should be considered in calculating CH4 emissions as 
well as in developing emission factors: 
Regional differences in rice cropping practices: If the country is large and has distinct 
agricultural regions with different climate and/or production systems (e.g., flooding patterns), a 
separate set of calculations should be performed for each region. 
Multiple crops: If more than one crop is harvested on a given area of land during the year, and the 
growing conditions vary among cropping seasons, calculations should be performed for each 
season. 
Water regime: In the context of this chapter, water regime is defined as a combination of (i) 
ecosystem type and (ii) flooding pattern. 
Ecosystem type: At a minimum, separate calculations should be undertaken for each rice 
ecosystem (i.e., irrigated, rainfed, and deep water rice production). 
Flooding pattern: Flooding pattern of rice fields has a significant effect on CH4 emissions (Sass et 
al., 1992; Yagi et al., 1996; Wassmann et al., 2000). Rice ecosystems can further be distinguished 
into continuously and intermittently flooded (irrigated rice), and regular rainfed, drought prone, 
and deep water (rainfed), according to the flooding patterns during the cultivation period. Also, 
flooding pattern before cultivation period should be considered (Yagi et al., 1998; Cai et al., 2000; 
2003a; Fitzgerald et al., 2000). 
Organic amendments to soils: Organic material incorporated into rice soils increases CH4 
emissions (Sch√ºtz et al., 1989; Yagi and Minami, 1990; Sass et al., 1991). The impact of organic 
amendments on CH4 emissions depends on type and amount of the applied material which can be 
described by a dose response curve (Denier van der Gon and Neue, 1995; Yan et al., 2005). 
Organic material incorporated into the soil can either be of endogenous (straw, green manure, etc.) 
or exogenous origin (compost, farmyard manure, etc.). Calculations of emissions should consider 
the effect of organic amendments. 
Other conditions: It is known that other factors, such as soil type (Sass et al., 1994; Wassmann et 
al., 1998; Huang et al., 2002), rice cultivar (Watanabe and Kimura, 1998; Wassmann and Aulakh, 
2000), sulphate containing amendments (Lindau et al., 1993; Denier van der Gon and Neue, 2002), 
etc., can significantly influence CH4 emissions. Inventory agencies are encouraged to make every 
effort to consider these conditions if country-specific information about the relationship between 
these conditions and CH4 emissions is available.

Tier 2 
Tier 2 applies the same methodological approach as Tier 1, but country-specific emission factors and/or scaling 
factors should be used. These country-specific factors are needed to reflect the local impact of the conditions (i, j, 
k, etc.) that influence CH4 emissions, preferably being developed through collection of field data. As for Tier 1 
approach, it is encouraged to implement the method at the most disaggregated level and to incorporate the 
multitude of conditions (i, j, k, etc.) that influence CH4 emissions.  
Tier 3 
Tier 3 includes models and monitoring networks tailored to address national circumstances of rice cultivation, 
repeated over time, driven by high-resolution activity data and disaggregated at sub-national level. Models can 
be empirical or mechanistic, but must in either case be validated with independent observations from country or 
region-specific studies that cover the range of rice cultivation characteristics (Cai et al., 2003b; Li et al., 2004; 
Huang et al., 2004). Proper documentation of the validity and completeness of the data, assumptions, equations 
and models used is therefore critical. Tier 3 methodologies may also take into account inter-annual variability 
triggered by typhoon damage, drought stress, etc. Ideally, the assessment should be based on recent satellite data. 
5.5.2 
Choice of emission and scaling factors 
Tier 1 
A baseline emission factor for no flooded fields for less than 180 days prior to rice cultivation and continuously 
flooded during the rice cultivation period without organic amendments (EFc) is used as a starting point. The 
IPCC default for EFc is 1.30 kg CH4 ha-1 day-1 (with error range of 0.80 - 2.20, Table 5.11), estimated by a 
statistical analysis of available field measurement data (Yan et al., 2005, the data set used in the analysis is 
available at a web site5).  
Scaling factors are used to adjust the EFc to account for the various conditions discussed in Box 5.2, which result 
in adjusted daily emission factors (EFi) for a particular sub-unit of disaggregated harvested area according to 
Equation 5.2. The most important scaling factors, namely water regime during and before cultivation period and 
organic amendments, are represented in Tables 5.12, 5.13, and 5.14, respectively, through default values.  
Country-specific scaling factors should only be used if they are based on well-researched and documented 
measurement data. It is encouraged to consider soil type, rice cultivar, and other factors if available.

Water regime during the cultivation period (SFw): Table 5.12 provides default scaling factors and error 
ranges reflecting different water regimes. The aggregated case refers to a situation when activity data are only 
available for rice ecosystem types, but not for flooding patterns (see Box 5.2). In the disaggregated case, 
flooding patterns can be distinguished in the form of three subcategories as shown in Table 5.12. It is good 
practice to collect more disaggregated activity data and apply disaggregated case SFw whenever possible.

Water regime before the cultivation period (SFp): Table 5.13 provides default scaling factors for water regime 
before the cultivation period which can be used when country-specific data are unavailable. This table 
distinguishes three different water regimes prior to rice cultivation, namely:  
1. Non-flooded pre-season < 180 days, which often occurs under double cropping of rice;   
2. Non-flooded pre-season > 180 days, e.g., single rice crop following a dry fallow period; and 
3. Flooded pre-season in which the minimum flooding interval is set to 30 days; i.e., shorter flooding periods 
(usually done to prepare the soil for ploughing) will not be included in this category.  
When activity data for the pre-season water status are not available, aggregated case factors can be used. It is 
good practice to collect more disaggregated activity data and apply disaggregated case of SFp. Scaling factors for 
additional water regimes can be applied if country-specific data are available.

Organic amendments (SFo): It is good practice to develop scaling factors that incorporate information on the 
type and amount of organic amendment applied (compost, farmyard manure, green manure, and rice straw). On 
an equal mass basis, more CH4 is emitted from amendments containing higher amounts of easily decomposable 
carbon and emissions also increase as more of each organic amendment is applied. Equation 5.3 and Table 5.14 
present an approach to vary the scaling factor according to the amount of different types of amendment applied. 
Rice straw is often incorporated into the soil after harvest. In the case of a long fallow after rice straw 
incorporation, CH4 emissions in the ensuing rice-growing season will be less than the case that rice straw is 
incorporated just before rice transplanting (Fitzgerald et al., 2000). Therefore, the timing of rice straw 
application was distinguished. An uncertainty range of 0.54-0.64 can be adopted for the exponent 0.59 in 
Equation 5.3.

Soil type (SFs) and rice cultivar (SFr): In some countries emission data for different soil types and rice cultivar 
are available and can be used to derive SFs and SFr, respectively. Both experiments and mechanistic knowledge 
confirm the importance of these factors, but large variations within the available data do not allow one to define 
reasonably accurate default values. It is anticipated that in the near future simulation models will be capable of 
producing specific scaling factors for SFs and SFr.  
Tier 2 
Inventory agencies can use country-specific emission factors from field measurements that cover the conditions 
of rice cultivation in their respective country.  It is good practice to compile country-specific data bases on 
available field measurements which supplement the Emission Factor database6 by other measurement programs 
(e.g., national) not yet included in this data base. However, certain standard QA/QC requirements apply to these 
field measurements (see Section 5.5.5).  
In Tier 2, inventory agencies can define the baseline management according to the prevailing conditions found in 
their respective country and determine country-specific emission factors for such a baseline. Then, inventory 
agencies can also determine country-specific scaling factors for management practices other than the baseline. In 
case where country-specific scaling factors are not available, default scaling factors can be used.  However, this 
may require some recalculation of the scaling factors given in Tables 5.12 to 5.14 if the condition is different 
from the baseline. 
Tier 3 
Tier 3 approaches do not require choice of emission factors, but are instead based on a thorough understanding 
of drivers and parameters (see above). 
5.5.3 
Choice of activity data  
In addition to the essential activity data requested above, it is good practice to match data on organic 
amendments and soil types to the same level of disaggregation as the activity data. It may be necessary to 
complete a survey of cropping practices to obtain data on the type and amount of organic amendments applied. 
Activity data are primarily based on harvested area statistics, which should be available from a national statistics 
agency as well as complementary information on cultivation period and agronomic practices. The activity data 
should be broken down by regional differences in rice cropping practices or water regime (see Box 5.2). 
Harvested area estimates corresponding to different conditions may be obtained on a countrywide basis through 
accepted methods of reporting. The use of locally verified areas would be most valuable when they are 
correlated with available data for emission factors under differing conditions such as climate, agronomic 
practices, and soil properties. If these data are not available in-country, they can be obtained from international 
data sources: e.g., IRRI (1995) and the World Rice Statistics on the website of IRRI7 (International Rice 
Research Institute), which include harvest area of rice by ecosystem type for major rice producing counties, a 
rice crop calendar for each country, and other useful information, and the FAOSTAT on the website of FAO8.

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The use of locally verified areas would be most valuable when they are correlated with available data for 
emission factors under differing conditions such as climate, agronomic practices, and soil properties. It may be 
necessary to consult local experts for a survey of agronomic practices relevant to methane emissions (organic 
amendments, water management, etc.). 
Most likely, activity data will be more reliable as compared to the accuracy of the emission factors. However, for 
various reasons the area statistics may be biased and a check of the harvested area statistics for (parts of) the 
country with remotely sensed data is encouraged.  
In addition to the essential activity data requested above, it is good practice, particularly in Tiers 2 and 3 
approaches, to match data on organic amendments and other conditions, e.g., soil types, to the same level of 
disaggregation as the activity data.  
5.5.4 
Uncertainty assessment 
The general principles of uncertainty assessment relevant for national emission inventories are elucidated in 
Volume 1, Chapter 3.  The uncertainty of emission and scaling factors may be influenced by natural variability, 
such as annual climate variability, and variability within units that are assumed to be homogenous, such as 
spatial variability in a field or soil unit. For this source category, good practice should permit determination of 
uncertainties using standard statistical methods when enough experimental data are available. Studies to quantify 
some of this uncertainty are rare but available (e.g., for soil type induced variability). The variability found in 
such studies is assumed to be generally valid. For more detail, see Sass (2002). 
Important activity data necessary to assign scaling factors (i.e., data on cultural practices and organic 
amendments) may not be available in current databases/statistics. Estimates of the fraction of rice farmers using 
a particular practice or amendment must then be based on expert judgement, and the uncertainty range in the 
estimated fraction should also be based on expert judgement. As a default value for the uncertainty in the 
fraction estimate as ¬± 0.2 (e.g., the fraction of farmers using organic amendment estimated at 0.4, the uncertainty 
range being 0.2 - 0.6). Volume 1, Chapter 3 provides advice on quantifying uncertainties in practice including 
combining expert judgements and empirical data into overall uncertainty estimates. 
In the case of CH4 emissions from rice cultivation, the uncertainty ranges of Tier 1 values (emission and scaling 
factors) can be adopted directly from Tables 5.11-5.14. Ranges are defined as the standard deviation about the 
mean, indicating the uncertainty associated with a given default value for this source category. The exponent in 
Equation 5.3 is provided with an uncertainty range of 0.54 - 0.64. Uncertainty assessment of Tier 2 and Tier 3 
approaches will depend on the respective data base and model used. Therefore, it is good practice to apply 
general principles of statistical analysis as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 3 as well as model approaches as 
outlined in Volume 4, Chapter 3, Section 3.5. 
5.5.5 
Completeness, Time series, QA/QC, and Reporting 
COMPLETENESS 
Complete coverage for this source category requires estimation of emissions from the following activities, where 
present: 
‚Ä¢ 
If soil submergence is not limited to the actual rice growing season, emissions outside of the rice growing 
season should be included (e.g., from a flooded fallow period). For further information, see Yagi et al., 1998; 
Cai et al., 2000; and Cai et al. 2003a; 
‚Ä¢ 
Other rice ecosystem categories, like swamp, inland-saline or tidal rice fields may be discriminated within 
each sub-category according to local emission measurements; 
‚Ä¢ 
If more than one rice crop is grown annually, these rice crops should be reported independently according to 
the local definition (e.g., early rice, late rice, wet season rice, dry season rice). The rice crops may fall into 
different categories with a different seasonally integrated emission factor and different correction factors for 
other modifiers like organic amendments. 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
As for other sources and categories, the methods for estimating CH4 emissions from rice fields should be applied 
consistently to every year in the time series and at the same level of disaggregation. If detailed activity level data 
are unavailable for earlier years, emissions for these years should be recalculated according to the guidance 
provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. If there have been significant changes in agricultural practices affecting CH4 
emissions over the time series, the estimation method should be implemented at a level of disaggregation which 
Chapter 5: Cropland 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
5.53 
is sufficient to discern the effects of these changes. For example, various trends in (Asian) rice agriculture such 
as the adoption of new rice varieties, increasing use of inorganic fertiliser, improved water management, 
changing use of organic amendments, and direct seeding may lead to increases or decreases in overall emissions. 
To weigh the impact of these changes, it may be necessary to use model studies. 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 8. It is good practice to document the emission estimate by reporting 
the information required to fill out the rice worksheet in the Guidelines. Inventory agencies that do not use the 
worksheets should provide comparable information. If the emission estimate is disaggregated by region, 
information on each region should be reported. 
The following additional information should be reported, if available, to ensure transparency: 
‚Ä¢ 
Water management practices; 
‚Ä¢ 
The types and amounts of organic amendments used. (Incorporation of rice straw or residues of the previous 
(non-rice) crop should be considered an organic amendment, although it may be a normal production 
practice and not aimed at increasing nutrient levels as is the case with manure additions); 
‚Ä¢ 
Soil types used for rice agriculture; 
‚Ä¢ 
Number of rice crops grown annually; and 
‚Ä¢ 
Most important rice cultivars grown. 
Inventory agencies using country-specific emission factors should provide information on the origin and basis of 
each factor, compare them to other published emission factors, explain any significant differences, and attempt 
to place bounds on the uncertainties.  
INVENTORY QUALITY ASSESSMENT/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) 
It is good practice to implement quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and expert review of 
the emission estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Tier 2 procedures in Volume 1, Chapter 
6, and quality assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to 
determine emissions from this source.  
A detailed treatment of inventory QA/QC for field measurement is given by Sass (2002). Some important issues 
are highlighted and summarised below. 
Measurements of standard methane emissions: The inventory QC procedures used at the rice field level will 
be determined largely by local scientists. There are, however, certain internationally determined procedures to 
obtain ‚Äòstandard emission factors‚Äô that should be common to all monitoring programmes. Instructions for 
obtaining standard emission factors are contained in IAEA (1992) and IGAC (1994). It is desirable for each 
laboratory in every reporting country to obtain this standard emission factor to ensure the intercomparibility and 
intercalibration of extended data sets used to establish country-specific emission factors. 
Compiling national emissions: Before accepting emissions data, the inventory agency should carry out an 
assessment of data quality and sampling procedures. This type of review requires close cooperation with national 
laboratories to obtain enough information to verify the reported emissions. The assessment should include 
sample recalculations, an assessment on reliability of agronomic and climate data, an identification of potential 
bias in the methodology, and recommendations for improvement. 
It is, at present, not possible to cross-check emissions estimates from this source category through external 
measurements. However, the inventory agency should ensure that emissions estimates undergo quality control by: 
‚Ä¢ 
Cross-referencing aggregated crop yield and reported field area statistics with national totals or other 
sources of crop yield/area data; 
‚Ä¢ 
Back-calculating national emission factors from aggregated emissions and other data; and 
‚Ä¢ 
Cross-referencing reported national totals with default values and data from other countries.

Annex 5A.1 
Estimation of default stock change factors for 
mineral soil C emissions/removals for cropland 
Default stock change factors are provided in Table 5.5 that were computed using a global dataset of experimental 
results for tillage, input, set-aside, and land use. The land-use factor represents the loss of carbon that occurs 
after 20 years of continuous cultivation. Tillage and input factors represent the effect on C stocks after 20 years 
following the management change. Set-aside factors represent the effect of temporary removal of cultivated 
cropland from production and placing it into perennial cover for a period of time that may extend to 20 years. 
Experimental data (citations provided in reference list) were analyzed in linear mixed-effects models, accounting 
for both fixed and random effects. Fixed effects included depth, number of years since the management change, 
and the type of management change (e.g., reduced tillage vs. no-till). For depth, data were not aggregated but 
included C stocks measured for each depth increment (e.g., 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, and 10-30 cm) as a separate point 
in the dataset. Similarly, time series data were not aggregated, even though those measurements were conducted 
on the same plots. Consequently, random effects were used to account for the dependencies in times series data 
and among data points representing different depths from the same study. If significant, a country level random 
effect was used to assess an additional uncertainty associated with applying a global default value to a specific 
country (included in the default uncertainties).  Data were transformed with a natural log transformation if model 
assumptions were not met for normality and homogeneity of variance (back-transformed values are given in the 
tables). Factors represent the effect of the management practice at 20 years for the top 30 cm of the soil, with the 
exception of the land-use factor, which represents the average loss of carbon at 20 years or longer time period 
following cultivation. Users of the Tier 1 method can approximate the annual change in carbon storage by 
dividing the inventory estimate by 20. Variance was calculated for each of the factor values, and can be used 
with simple error propagation methods or to construct probability distribution functions with a normal density.
