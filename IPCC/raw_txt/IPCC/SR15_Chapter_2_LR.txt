Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
Executive Summary
This chapter assesses mitigation pathways consistent with limiting 
warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. In doing so, it explores 
the following key questions: What role do CO2 and non-CO2 emissions 
play? {2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6} To what extent do 1.5°C pathways involve 
overshooting and returning below 1.5°C during the 21st century? {2.2, 
2.3} What are the implications for transitions in energy, land use and 
sustainable development? {2.3, 2.4, 2.5} How do policy frameworks 
affect the ability to limit warming to 1.5°C? {2.3, 2.5} What are the 
associated knowledge gaps? {2.6}
The assessed pathways describe integrated, quantitative 
evolutions of all emissions over the 21st century associated 
with global energy and land use and the world economy. The 
assessment is contingent upon available integrated assessment 
literature and model assumptions, and is complemented by other 
studies with different scope, for example, those focusing on individual 
sectors. In recent years, integrated mitigation studies have improved 
the characterizations of mitigation pathways. However, limitations 
remain, as climate damages, avoided impacts, or societal co-benefits 
of the modelled transformations remain largely unaccounted for, while 
concurrent rapid technological changes, behavioural aspects, and 
uncertainties about input data present continuous challenges. (high 
confidence) {2.1.3, 2.3, 2.5.1, 2.6, Technical Annex 2}
The Chances of Limiting Warming to 1.5°C 
and the Requirements for Urgent Action
Pathways consistent with 1.5°C of warming above pre-industrial 
levels can be identified under a range of assumptions about 
economic growth, technology developments and lifestyles. 
However, lack of global cooperation, lack of governance of the required 
energy and land transformation, and increases in resource-intensive 
consumption are key impediments to achieving 1.5°C pathways. 
Governance challenges have been related to scenarios with high 
inequality and high population growth in the 1.5°C pathway literature. 
{2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.5}
Under emissions in line with current pledges under the Paris 
Agreement (known as Nationally Determined Contributions, 
or NDCs), global warming is expected to surpass 1.5°C above 
pre-industrial levels, even if these pledges are supplemented 
with very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of 
mitigation after 2030 (high confidence). This increased action 
would need to achieve net zero CO2 emissions in less than 15 years. 
Even if this is achieved, temperatures would only be expected to remain 
below the 1.5°C threshold if the actual geophysical response ends up 
being towards the low end of the currently estimated uncertainty range. 
Transition challenges as well as identified trade-offs can be reduced if 
global emissions peak before 2030 and marked emissions reductions 
compared to today are already achieved by 2030. {2.2, 2.3.5, Cross-
Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}
Limiting warming to 1.5°C depends on greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions over the next decades, where lower GHG emissions in 
2030 lead to a higher chance of keeping peak warming to 1.5°C 
(high confidence). Available pathways that aim for no or limited (less 
than 0.1°C) overshoot of 1.5°C keep GHG emissions in 2030 to 25–30 
GtCO2e yr−1 in 2030 (interquartile range). This contrasts with median 
estimates for current unconditional NDCs of 52–58 GtCO2e yr−1 in 
2030. Pathways that aim for limiting warming to 1.5°C by 2100 after 
a temporary temperature overshoot rely on large-scale deployment 
of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measures, which are uncertain and 
entail clear risks. In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 
1.5°C, global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions decline by about 45% 
from 2010 levels by 2030 (40–60% interquartile range), reaching net 
zero around 2050 (2045–2055 interquartile range). For limiting global 
warming to below 2°C with at least 66% probability CO2 emissions 
are projected to decline by about 25% by 2030 in most pathways (10–
30% interquartile range) and reach net zero around 2070 (2065–2080 
interquartile range).1 {2.2, 2.3.3, 2.3.5, 2.5.3, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 in 
Chapter 3 and 9 in Chapter 4, 4.3.7}
Limiting warming to 1.5°C implies reaching net zero CO2 
emissions globally around 2050 and concurrent deep reductions 
in emissions of non-CO2 forcers, particularly methane (high 
confidence). Such mitigation pathways are characterized by energy-
demand reductions, decarbonization of electricity and other fuels, 
electrification of energy end use, deep reductions in agricultural 
emissions, and some form of CDR with carbon storage on land or 
sequestration in geological reservoirs. Low energy demand and low 
demand for land- and GHG-intensive consumption goods facilitate 
limiting warming to as close as possible to 1.5°C. {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.3.5, 
2.5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}.
In comparison to a 2°C limit, the transformations required to limit 
warming to 1.5°C are qualitatively similar but more pronounced 
and rapid over the next decades (high confidence). 1.5°C implies 
very ambitious, internationally cooperative policy environments that 
transform both supply and demand (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5}
Policies reflecting a high price on emissions are necessary 
in models to achieve cost-effective 1.5°C pathways (high 
confidence). Other things being equal, modelling studies suggest 
the global average discounted marginal abatement costs for limiting 
warming to 1.5°C being about 3–4 times higher compared to 2°C 
over the 21st century, with large variations across models and socio-
economic and policy assumptions. Carbon pricing can be imposed 
directly or implicitly by regulatory policies. Policy instruments, like 
technology policies or performance standards, can complement explicit 
carbon pricing in specific areas. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 4.4.5}
Limiting warming to 1.5°C requires a marked shift in investment 
patterns (medium confidence). Additional annual average energy-
related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting 
warming to 1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies 
beyond those in place today (i.e., baseline) are estimated to be around 
1 
Kyoto-GHG emissions in this statement are aggregated with GWP-100 values of the IPCC Second Assessment Report.

830 billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 
across six models). Total energy-related investments increase by about 
12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. 
Average annual investment in low-carbon energy technologies and 
energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor 
of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 2015, overtaking fossil investments 
globally by around 2025 (medium confidence). Uncertainties and 
strategic mitigation portfolio choices affect the magnitude and focus 
of required investments. {2.5.2}
Future Emissions in 1.5°C Pathways 
Mitigation requirements can be quantified using carbon budget 
approaches that relate cumulative CO2 emissions to global mean 
temperature increase. Robust physical understanding underpins 
this relationship, but uncertainties become increasingly relevant as a 
specific temperature limit is approached. These uncertainties relate to 
the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE), 
non-CO2 emissions, radiative forcing and response, potential additional 
Earth system feedbacks (such as permafrost thawing), and historical 
emissions and temperature. {2.2.2, 2.6.1} 
Cumulative CO2 emissions are kept within a budget by reducing 
global annual CO2 emissions to net zero. This assessment 
suggests a remaining budget of about 420 GtCO2 for a two-
thirds chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and of about 580 
GtCO2 for an even chance (medium confidence). The remaining 
carbon budget is defined here as cumulative CO2 emissions from the 
start of 2018 until the time of net zero global emissions for global 
warming defined as a change in global near-surface air temperatures. 
Remaining budgets applicable to 2100 would be approximately 
100 GtCO2 lower than this to account for permafrost thawing and 
potential methane release from wetlands in the future, and more 
thereafter. These estimates come with an additional geophysical 
uncertainty of at least ±400 GtCO2, related to non-CO2 response 
and TCRE distribution. Uncertainties in the level of historic warming 
contribute ±250 GtCO2. In addition, these estimates can vary by 
±250 GtCO2 depending on non-CO2 mitigation strategies as found in 
available pathways. {2.2.2, 2.6.1}
Staying within a remaining carbon budget of 580 GtCO2 implies 
that CO2 emissions reach carbon neutrality in about 30 years, 
reduced to 20 years for a 420 GtCO2 remaining carbon budget 
(high confidence). The ±400 GtCO2 geophysical uncertainty range 
surrounding a carbon budget translates into a variation of this timing 
of carbon neutrality of roughly ±15–20 years. If emissions do not start 
declining in the next decade, the point of carbon neutrality would need 
to be reached at least two decades earlier to remain within the same 
carbon budget. {2.2.2, 2.3.5}
Non-CO2 emissions contribute to peak warming and thus 
affect the remaining carbon budget. The evolution of 
methane and sulphur dioxide emissions strongly influences 
the chances of limiting warming to 1.5°C. In the near-term, a 
weakening of aerosol cooling would add to future warming, 
but can be tempered by reductions in methane emissions (high 
confidence). Uncertainty in radiative forcing estimates (particularly 
aerosol) affects carbon budgets and the certainty of pathway 
categorizations. Some non-CO2 forcers are emitted alongside CO2, 
particularly in the energy and transport sectors, and can be largely 
addressed through CO2 mitigation. Others require specific measures, 
for example, to target agricultural nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane 
(CH4), some sources of black carbon, or hydrofluorocarbons (high 
confidence). In many cases, non-CO2 emissions reductions are similar 
in 2°C pathways, indicating reductions near their assumed maximum 
potential by integrated assessment models. Emissions of N2O and 
NH3 increase in some pathways with strongly increased bioenergy 
demand. {2.2.2, 2.3.1, 2.4.2, 2.5.3}
The Role of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) 
All analysed pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no 
or limited overshoot use CDR to some extent to neutralize 
emissions from sources for which no mitigation measures 
have been identified and, in most cases, also to achieve 
net negative emissions to return global warming to 1.5°C 
following a peak (high confidence). The longer the delay in 
reducing CO2 emissions towards zero, the larger the likelihood 
of exceeding 1.5°C, and the heavier the implied reliance on 
net negative emissions after mid-century to return warming to 
1.5°C (high confidence). The faster reduction of net CO2 emissions 
in 1.5°C compared to 2°C pathways is predominantly achieved by 
measures that result in less CO2 being produced and emitted, and 
only to a smaller degree through additional CDR. Limitations on 
the speed, scale and societal acceptability of CDR deployment also 
limit the conceivable extent of temperature overshoot. Limits to our 
understanding of how the carbon cycle responds to net negative 
emissions increase the uncertainty about the effectiveness of CDR to 
decline temperatures after a peak. {2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 4.3.7}
CDR deployed at scale is unproven, and reliance on such 
technology is a major risk in the ability to limit warming to 
1.5°C. CDR is needed less in pathways with particularly strong 
emphasis on energy efficiency and low demand. The scale and 
type of CDR deployment varies widely across 1.5°C pathways, 
with different consequences for achieving sustainable 
development objectives (high confidence). Some pathways rely 
more on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), while 
others rely more on afforestation, which are the two CDR methods 
most often included in integrated pathways. Trade-offs with other 
sustainability objectives occur predominantly through increased land, 
energy, water and investment demand. Bioenergy use is substantial 
in 1.5°C pathways with or without BECCS due to its multiple roles in 
decarbonizing energy use. {2.3.1, 2.5.3, 2.6.3, 4.3.7}
Properties of Energy and Land Transitions in 1.5°C Pathways 
The share of primary energy from renewables increases while 
coal usage decreases across pathways limiting warming to 
1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). By 2050, 
renewables (including bioenergy, hydro, wind, and solar, with direct-
equivalence method) supply a share of 52–67% (interquartile range) 
of primary energy in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot; 
while the share from coal decreases to 1–7% (interquartile range), 
97

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
with a large fraction of this coal use combined with carbon capture 
and storage (CCS). From 2020 to 2050 the primary energy supplied 
by oil declines in most pathways (−39 to −77% interquartile range). 
Natural gas changes by −13% to −62% (interquartile range), but 
some pathways show a marked increase albeit with widespread 
deployment of CCS. The overall deployment of CCS varies widely 
across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with cumulative 
CO2 stored through 2050 ranging from zero up to 300 GtCO2 
(minimum–maximum range), of which zero up to 140 GtCO2 is stored 
from biomass. Primary energy supplied by bioenergy ranges from 
40–310 EJ yr−1 in 2050 (minimum-maximum range), and nuclear from 
3–66 EJ yr−1 (minimum–maximum range). These ranges reflect both 
uncertainties in technological development and strategic mitigation 
portfolio choices. {2.4.2}
1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot include a rapid 
decline in the carbon intensity of electricity and an increase 
in electrification of energy end use (high confidence). By 2050, 
the carbon intensity of electricity decreases to −92 to +11 gCO2 MJ−1 
(minimum–maximum range) from about 140 gCO2 MJ−1 in 2020, 
and electricity covers 34–71% (minimum–maximum range) of final 
energy across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot from 
about 20% in 2020. By 2050, the share of electricity supplied by 
renewables increases to 59–97% (minimum-maximum range) across 
1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. Pathways with higher 
chances of holding warming to below 1.5°C generally show a faster 
decline in the carbon intensity of electricity by 2030 than pathways 
that temporarily overshoot 1.5°C. {2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.4.3}
Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all 
pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot, but their scale depends on the pursued mitigation 
portfolio (high confidence). Pathways that limit global warming to 
1.5°C with no or limited overshoot project a 4 million km2 reduction 
to a 2.5 million km2 increase of non-pasture agricultural land for food 
and feed crops and a 0.5–11 million km2 reduction of pasture land, 
to be converted into 0-6 million km2 of agricultural land for energy 
crops and a 2 million km2 reduction to 9.5 million km2 increase in 
forests by 2050 relative to 2010 (medium confidence). Land-use 
transitions of similar magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C 
pathways (medium confidence). Such large transitions pose profound 
challenges for sustainable management of the various demands on 
land for human settlements, food, livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, 
carbon storage, biodiversity and other ecosystem services (high 
confidence). {2.3.4, 2.4.4}
Demand-Side Mitigation and Behavioural Changes 
Demand-side measures are key elements of 1.5°C pathways. 
Lifestyle choices lowering energy demand and the land- and 
GHG-intensity of food consumption can further support 
achievement of 1.5°C pathways (high confidence). By 2030 and 
2050, all end-use sectors (including building, transport, and industry) 
show marked energy demand reductions in modelled 1.5°C pathways, 
comparable and beyond those projected in 2°C pathways. Sectoral 
models support the scale of these reductions. {2.3.4, 2.4.3, 2.5.1}
Links between 1.5°C Pathways and Sustainable Development 
Choices about mitigation portfolios for limiting warming to 
1.5°C can positively or negatively impact the achievement of 
other societal objectives, such as sustainable development 
(high confidence). In particular, demand-side and efficiency 
measures, and lifestyle choices that limit energy, resource, and 
GHG-intensive food demand support sustainable development 
(medium confidence). Limiting warming to 1.5°C can be achieved 
synergistically with poverty alleviation and improved energy security 
and can provide large public health benefits through improved air 
quality, preventing millions of premature deaths. However, specific 
mitigation measures, such as bioenergy, may result in trade-offs that 
require consideration. {2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3}

Chapter 2 
Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development

2.1 
Introduction to Mitigation Pathways and 
the Sustainable Development Context
This chapter assesses the literature on mitigation pathways to limit or 
return global mean warming to 1.5°C (relative to the pre-industrial 
base period 1850–1900). Key questions addressed are: What types of 
mitigation pathways have been developed that could be consistent 
with 1.5°C? What changes in emissions, energy and land use do they 
entail? What do they imply for climate policy and implementation, and 
what impacts do they have on sustainable development? In terms of 
feasibility (see Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1), this chapter focuses 
on geophysical dimensions and technological and economic enabling 
factors. Social and institutional dimensions as well as additional 
aspects of technical feasibility are covered in Chapter 4.
Mitigation pathways are typically designed to reach a predefined 
climate target alone. Minimization of mitigation expenditures, but 
not climate-related damages or sustainable development impacts, 
is often the basis for these pathways to the desired climate target 
(see Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter for additional discussion). 
However, there are interactions between mitigation and multiple other 
sustainable development goals (see Sections 1.1 and 5.4) that provide 
both challenges and opportunities for climate action. Hence there are 
substantial efforts to evaluate the effects of the various mitigation 
pathways on sustainable development, focusing in particular on 
aspects for which integrated assessment models (IAMs) provide 
relevant information (e.g., land-use changes and biodiversity, food 
security, and air quality). More broadly, there are efforts to incorporate 
climate change mitigation as one of multiple objectives that, in general, 
reflect societal concerns more completely and could potentially provide 
benefits at lower costs than simultaneous single-objective policies 
(e.g., Clarke et al., 2014). For example, with carefully selected policies, 
universal energy access can be achieved while simultaneously reducing 
air pollution and mitigating climate change (McCollum et al., 2011; 
Riahi et al., 2012; IEA, 2017d). This chapter thus presents both the 
pathways and an initial discussion of their context within sustainable 
development objectives (Section 2.5), with the latter, along with equity 
and ethical issues, discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
As described in Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, scenarios are 
comprehensive, plausible, integrated descriptions of possible futures 
based on specified, internally consistent underlying assumptions, 
with pathways often used to describe the clear temporal evolution of 
specific scenario aspects or goal-oriented scenarios. We include both 
these usages of ‘pathways’ here.
2.1.1 
Mitigation Pathways Consistent with 1.5°C
Emissions scenarios need to cover all sectors and regions over the 
21st century to be associated with a climate change projection out to 
2100. Assumptions regarding future trends in population, consumption 
of goods and services (including food), economic growth, behaviour, 
technology, policies and institutions are all required to generate 
scenarios (Section 2.3.1). These societal choices must then be linked 
to the drivers of climate change, including emissions of well-mixed 
greenhouse gases and aerosol and ozone precursors as well as land-
use and land-cover changes. Deliberate solar radiation modification is 
not included in these scenarios (see Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 4).
Plausible developments need to be anticipated in many facets of the 
key sectors of energy and land use. Within energy, these scenarios 
consider energy resources like biofuels, energy supply and conversion 
technologies, energy consumption, and supply and end-use efficiency. 
Within land use, agricultural productivity, food demand, terrestrial 
carbon management, and biofuel production are all considered. 
Climate policies are also considered, including carbon pricing and 
technology policies such as research and development funding and 
subsidies. The scenarios incorporate regional differentiation in sectoral 
and policy development. The climate changes resulting from such 
scenarios are derived using models that typically incorporate physical 
understanding of the carbon cycle and climate response derived from 
complex geophysical models evaluated against observations (Sections 
2.2 and 2.6). 
The temperature response to a given emission pathway (see glossary) is 
uncertain and therefore quantified in terms of a probabilistic outcome. 
Chapter 1 assesses the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement in 
terms of human-induced warming, thus excluding potential impacts 
of natural forcing such as volcanic eruptions or solar output changes 
or unforced internal variability. Temperature responses in this chapter 
are assessed using simple geophysically based models that evaluate 
the anthropogenic component of future temperature change and do 
not incorporate internal natural variations and are thus fit for purpose 
in the context of this assessment (Section 2.2.1). Hence a scenario 
that is consistent with 1.5°C may in fact lead to either a higher or 
lower temperature change, but within quantified and generally well-
understood bounds (see also Chapter 1, Section 1.2.3). Consistency 
with avoiding a human-induced temperature change limit must 
therefore also be defined probabilistically, with likelihood values 
selected based on risk-avoidance preferences. Responses beyond 
global mean temperature are not typically evaluated in such models 
and are assessed in Chapter 3.
2.1.2 
The Use of Scenarios
Variations in scenario assumptions and design define to a large 
degree which questions can be addressed with a specific scenario 
set, for example, the exploration of implications of delayed climate 
mitigation action. In this assessment, the following classes of 1.5°C- 
and 2°C-consistent scenarios are of particular interest to the topics 
addressed in this chapter: (i) scenarios with the same climate target 
over the 21st century but varying socio-economic assumptions 
(Sections 2.3 and 2.4), (ii) pairs of scenarios with similar socio-

(Section 2.3), and (iii) scenarios that follow the Nationally Determined 
Contributions or NDCs2 until 2030 with much more stringent mitigation 
action thereafter (Section 2.3.5).

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
Characteristics of these pathways, such as emissions reduction rates, 
time of peaking, and low-carbon energy deployment rates, can be 
assessed as being consistent with 1.5°C. However, they cannot be 
assessed as ‘requirements’ for 1.5°C, unless a targeted analysis 
is available that specifically asked whether there could be other 
1.5°C-consistent pathways without the characteristics in question. AR5 
already assessed such targeted analyses, for example, asking which 
technologies are important in order to keep open the possibility of 
limiting warming to 2°C (Clarke et al., 2014). By now, several such 
targeted analyses are also available for questions related to 1.5°C 
(Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Bauer et al., 2018; Strefler 
et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018). This assessment distinguishes 
between ‘consistent’ and the much stronger concept of required 
characteristics of 1.5°C pathways wherever possible. 
Ultimately, society will adjust the choices it makes as new information 
becomes available and technical learning progresses, and these 
adjustments can be in either direction. Earlier scenario studies have 
shown, however, that deeper emissions reductions in the near term 
hedge against the uncertainty of both climate response and future 
technology availability (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Clarke 
et al., 2014). Not knowing what adaptations might be put in place in 
the future, and due to limited studies, this chapter examines prospective 
rather than iteratively adaptive mitigation pathways (Cross-Chapter 
Box 1 in Chapter 1). Societal choices illustrated by scenarios may also 
influence what futures are envisioned as possible or desirable and 
hence whether those come into being (Beck and Mahony, 2017).
2.1.3 
New Scenario Information since AR5
In this chapter, we extend the AR5 mitigation pathway assessment 
based on new scenario literature. Updates in understanding of 
climate sensitivity, transient climate response, radiative forcing, and 
the cumulative carbon budget consistent with 1.5°C are discussed in 
Sections 2.2.
Mitigation pathways developed with detailed process-based 
integrated assessment models (IAMs) covering all sectors and regions 
over the 21st century describe an internally consistent and calibrated 
(to historical trends) way to get from current developments to 
meeting long-term climate targets like 1.5°C (Clarke et al., 2014). The 
overwhelming majority of available 1.5°C pathways were generated 
by such IAMs, and these pathways can be directly linked to climate 
outcomes and their consistency with the 1.5°C goal evaluated. The 
AR5 similarly relied upon such studies, which were mainly discussed in 
Chapter 6 of Working Group III (WGIII) (Clarke et al., 2014). 
Since the AR5, several new, integrated multimodel studies have 
appeared in the literature that explore specific characteristics of 
scenarios more stringent than the lowest scenario category assessed 
in AR5 that was assessed to limit warming below 2°C with greater 
than 66% likelihood (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; Akimoto et al., 2017; 
Marcucci et al., 2017; Su et al., 2017; Bauer et al., 2018; Bertram et 
al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; 
Liu et al., 2018; Luderer et al., 2018; Strefler et al., 2018a; van Vuuren 
et al., 2018; Vrontisi et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Those scenarios 
explore 1.5°C-consistent pathways from multiple perspectives 
(see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), examining sensitivity to 
assumptions regarding:
• socio-economic drivers and developments including energy and  
 
food demand as, for example, characterized by the Shared Socio- 
 
Economic Pathways (SSPs; Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1) 
• near-term climate policies describing different levels of strengthening  
 
the NDCs
• the use of bioenergy and the availability and desirability of carbon  
 
dioxide removal (CDR) technologies
A large number of these scenarios were collected in a scenario database 
established for the assessment of this Special Report (Supplementary 
Material 2.SM.1.3). Mitigation pathways were classified by four 
factors: consistency with a temperature increase limit (as defined by 
Chapter 1), whether they temporarily overshoot that limit, the extent 
of this potential overshoot, and the likelihood of falling within these 
bounds. 
Specifically, they were put into classes that either kept surface 
temperature increases below a given threshold throughout the 21st 
century or returned to a value below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels 
at some point before 2100 after temporarily exceeding that level earlier 
– referred to as an overshoot (OS). Both groups were further separated 
based on the probability of being below the threshold and the degree 
of overshoot, respectively (Table 2.1). Pathways are uniquely classified, 
with 1.5°C-related classes given higher priority than 2°C classes in 
cases where a pathway would be applicable to either class. 
The probability assessment used in the scenario classification is based 
on simulations using two reduced-complexity carbon cycle, atmospheric 
composition, and climate models: the ‘Model for the Assessment of 
Greenhouse Gas-Induced Climate Change’ (MAGICC) (Meinshausen 
et al., 2011a), and the ‘Finite Amplitude Impulse Response’ (FAIRv1.3) 
model (Smith et al., 2018). For the purpose of this report, and to facilitate 
comparison with AR5, the range of the key carbon cycle and climate 
parameters for MAGICC and its setup are identical to those used in 
AR5 WGIII (Clarke et al., 2014). For each mitigation pathway, MAGICC 
and FAIR simulations provide probabilistic estimates of atmospheric 
concentrations, radiative forcing and global temperature outcomes until 
2100. However, the classification uses MAGICC probabilities directly for 
traceability with AR5 and because this model is more established in the 
literature. Nevertheless, the overall uncertainty assessment is based on 
results from both models, which are considered in the context of the 
latest radiative forcing estimates and observed temperatures (Etminan 
et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018) (Section 2.2 and Supplementary Material 
2.SM.1.1). The comparison of these lines of evidence shows high 
agreement in the relative temperature response of pathways, with 
medium agreement on the precise absolute magnitude of warming, 
introducing a level of imprecision in these attributes. Consideration of 
the combined evidence here leads to medium confidence in the overall 
geophysical characteristics of the pathways reported here. 
In addition to the characteristics of the above-mentioned classes, 
four illustrative pathway archetypes have been selected and are used 
throughout this chapter to highlight specific features of and variations 
across 1.5°C pathways. These are chosen in particular to illustrate the 
spectrum of CO2 emissions reduction patterns consistent with 1.5°C,

ranging from very rapid and deep near-term decreases, facilitated 
by efficiency and demand-side measures that lead to limited CDR 
requirements, to relatively slower but still rapid emissions reductions 
that lead to a temperature overshoot and necessitate large CDR 
deployment later in the century (Section 2.3).
2.1.4 
Utility of Integrated Assessment Models 
(IAMs) in the Context of this Report
IAMs lie at the basis of the assessment of mitigation pathways in this 
chapter, as much of the quantitative global scenario literature is derived 
with such models. IAMs combine insights from various disciplines in a 
single framework, resulting in a dynamic description of the coupled 
energy–economy–land-climate system that cover the largest sources 
of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from different 
sectors. Many of the IAMs that contributed mitigation scenarios to this 
assessment include a process-based description of the land system in 
addition to the energy system (e.g., Popp et al., 2017), and several have 
been extended to cover air pollutants (Rao et al., 2017) and water use 
(Hejazi et al., 2014; Fricko et al., 2016; Mouratiadou et al., 2016). Such 
integrated pathways hence allow the exploration of the whole-system 
transformation, as well as the interactions, synergies, and trade-
offs between sectors, and, increasingly, questions beyond climate 
mitigation (von Stechow et al., 2015). The models do not, however, fully 
account for all constraints that could affect realization of pathways 
(see Chapter 4). 
Section 2.3 assesses the overall characteristics of 1.5°C pathways 
based on fully integrated pathways, while Sections 2.4 and 2.5 describe 
underlying sectoral transformations, including insights from sector-
specific assessment models and pathways that are not derived from 
IAMs. Such models provide detail in their domain of application and 
make exogenous assumptions about cross-sectoral or global factors. 
They often focus on a specific sector, such as the energy (Bruckner et 
al., 2014; IEA, 2017a; Jacobson, 2017; OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017), 
buildings (Lucon et al., 2014) or transport (Sims et al., 2014) sector, or 
a specific country or region (Giannakidis et al., 2018). Sector-specific 
pathways are assessed in relation to integrated pathways because they 
cannot be directly linked to 1.5°C by themselves if they do not extend 
to 2100 or do not include all GHGs or aerosols from all sectors.
AR5 found sectoral 2°C decarbonization strategies from IAMs to be 
consistent with sector-specific studies (Clarke et al., 2014). A growing 
body of literature on 100%-renewable energy scenarios has emerged 
(e.g., see Creutzig et al., 2017; Jacobson et al., 2017), which goes 
beyond the wide range of IAM projections of renewable energy shares 
in 1.5°C and 2°C pathways. While the representation of renewable 
energy resource potentials, technology costs and system integration in 
IAMs has been updated since AR5, leading to higher renewable energy 
deployments in many cases (Luderer et al., 2017; Pietzcker et al., 2017), 
none of the IAM projections identify 100% renewable energy solutions 
for the global energy system as part of cost-effective mitigation 
pathways (Section 2.4.2). Bottom-up studies find higher mitigation 
potentials in the industry, buildings, and transport sectors in 2030 than 
realized in selected 2°C pathways from IAMs (UNEP 2017), indicating 
the possibility to strengthen sectoral decarbonization strategies until 
2030 beyond the integrated 1.5°C pathways assessed in this chapter 
(Luderer et al., 2018). 
Detailed, process-based IAMs are a diverse set of models ranging 
from partial equilibrium energy–land models to computable general 
equilibrium models of the global economy, from myopic to perfect 
foresight models, and from models with to models without endogenous 
technological change (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2). The IAMs 
used in this chapter have limited to no coverage of climate impacts. 
They typically use GHG pricing mechanisms to induce emissions 
reductions and associated changes in energy and land uses consistent 
with the imposed climate goal. The scenarios generated by these 
models are defined by the choice of climate goals and assumptions 
about near-term climate policy developments. They are also shaped 
by assumptions about mitigation potentials and technologies as well 
as baseline developments such as, for example, those represented by 
101

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
different Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs), especially those 
pertaining to energy and food demand (Riahi et al., 2017). See Section 
2.3.1 for discussion of these assumptions. Since the AR5, the scenario 
literature has greatly expanded the exploration of these dimensions. 
This includes low-demand scenarios (Grubler et al., 2018; van Vuuren 
et al., 2018), scenarios taking into account a larger set of sustainable 
development goals (Bertram et al., 2018), scenarios with restricted 
availability of CDR technologies (Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; 
Holz et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Strefler et al., 2018b; van Vuuren 
et al., 2018), scenarios with near-term action dominated by regulatory 
policies (Kriegler et al., 2018a) and scenario variations across the 
SSPs (Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018). IAM results depend upon 
multiple underlying assumptions, for example, the extent to which 
global markets and economies are assumed to operate frictionless 
and policies are cost-optimized, assumptions about technological 
progress and availability and costs of mitigation and CDR measures, 
assumptions about underlying socio-economic developments and 
future energy, food and materials demand, and assumptions about 
the geographic and temporal pattern of future regulatory and carbon 
pricing policies (see Supplementary Material  2.SM.1.2 for additional 
discussion on IAMs and their limitations).
2.2 
Geophysical Relationships and Constraints
Emissions pathways can be characterized by various geophysical 
characteristics, such as radiative forcing (Masui et al., 2011; Riahi et 
al., 2011; Thomson et al., 2011; van Vuuren et al., 2011b), atmospheric 
concentrations (van Vuuren et al., 2007, 2011a; Clarke et al., 2014) or 
associated temperature outcomes (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Rogelj 
et al., 2011; Luderer et al., 2013). These attributes can be used to 
derive geophysical relationships for specific pathway classes, such as 
cumulative CO2 emissions compatible with a specific level of warming, 
also known as ‘carbon budgets’ (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Rogelj et al., 
2011; Stocker et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a), the consistent 
contributions of non-CO2 GHGs and aerosols to the remaining carbon 
budget (Bowerman et al., 2011; Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2016b), or to 
temperature outcomes (Lamarque et al., 2011; Bowerman et al., 2013; 
Rogelj et al., 2014b). This section assesses geophysical relationships for 
both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions (see glossary). 
2.2.1 
Geophysical Characteristics of Mitigation Pathways
This section employs the pathway classification introduced in Section 
2.1, with geophysical characteristics derived from simulations with 
the MAGICC reduced-complexity carbon cycle and climate model and 
supported by simulations with the FAIR reduced-complexity model 
(Section 2.1). Within a specific category and between models, there 
remains a large degree of variance. Most pathways exhibit a temperature 
overshoot which has been highlighted in several studies focusing on 
stringent mitigation pathways (Huntingford and Lowe, 2007; Wigley 
et al., 2007; Nohara et al., 2015; Rogelj et al., 2015d; Zickfeld and 
Herrington, 2015; Schleussner et al., 2016; Xu and Ramanathan, 
2017). Only very few of the scenarios collected in the database for 
this report hold the average future warming projected by MAGICC 
below 1.5°C during the entire 21st century (Table 2.1, Figure 2.1). Most 
1.5°C-consistent pathways available in the database overshoot 1.5°C 
around mid-century before peaking and then reducing temperatures 
so as to return below that level in 2100. However, because of 
numerous geophysical uncertainties and model dependencies (Section 
2.2.1.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1), absolute temperature 
characteristics of the various pathway categories are more difficult to 
distinguish than relative features (Figure 2.1, Supplementary Material 
2.SM.1.1), and actual probabilities of overshoot are imprecise. However, 
all lines of evidence available for temperature projections indicate a 
probability greater than 50% of overshooting 1.5°C by mid-century in 
all but the most stringent pathways currently available (Supplementary 
Material 2.SM.1.1, 2.SM.1.4).
Most 1.5°C-consistent pathways exhibit a peak in temperature by mid-
century whereas 2°C-consistent pathways generally peak after 2050 
(Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.4). The peak in median temperature 
in the various pathway categories occurs about ten years before 
reaching net zero CO2 emissions due to strongly reduced annual 
CO2 emissions and deep reductions in CH4 emissions (Section 2.3.3). 
The two reduced-complexity climate models used in this assessment 
suggest that virtually all available 1.5°C-consistent pathways peak 
and then decline global mean temperature, but with varying rates 
of temperature decline after the peak (Figure 2.1). The estimated 
decadal rates of temperature change by the end of the century are 
smaller than the amplitude of the climate variability as assessed in AR5 
(1 standard deviation of about ±0.1°C), which hence complicates the 
detection of a global peak and decline of warming in observations on 
time scales of one to two decades (Bindoff et al., 2013). In comparison, 
many pathways limiting warming to 2°C or higher by 2100 still have 
noticeable increasing trends at the end of the century, and thus imply 
continued warming. 
By 2100, the difference between 1.5°C- and 2°C-consistent pathways 
becomes clearer compared to mid-century, not only for the temperature 
response (Figure 2.1) but also for atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In 
2100, the median CO2 concentration in 1.5°C-consistent pathways is 
below 2016 levels (Le Quéré et al., 2018), whereas it remains higher 
by about 5–10% compared to 2016 in the 2°C-consistent pathways. 
2.2.1.1 Geophysical uncertainties: non-CO2 forcing agents
Impacts of non-CO2 climate forcers on temperature outcomes are 
particularly important when evaluating stringent mitigation pathways 
(Weyant et al., 2006; Shindell et al., 2012; Rogelj et al., 2014b, 2015a; 
Samset et al., 2018). However, many uncertainties affect the role of 
non-CO2 climate forcers in stringent mitigation pathways.
A first uncertainty arises from the magnitude of the radiative forcing 
attributed to non-CO2 climate forcers. Figure 2.2 illustrates how, for 
one representative 1.5°C-consistent pathway (SSP2-1.9) (Fricko et al., 
2017; Rogelj et al., 2018), the effective radiative forcings as estimated 
by MAGICC and FAIR can differ (see Supplementary Material 2.SM1.1 
for further details). This large spread in non-CO2 effective radiative 
forcings leads to considerable uncertainty in the predicted temperature 
response. This uncertainty ultimately affects the assessed temperature 
outcomes for pathway classes used in this chapter (Section 2.1) and 
also affects the carbon budget (Section 2.2.2). Figure 2.2 highlights

uncertainty as captured by MAGICC and FAIR and show the minimal warming of the 5th percentile of projected warming and the maximal warming of the 95th percentile of

the important role of methane emissions reduction in this scenario, in 
agreement with the recent literature focussing on stringent mitigation 
pathways (Shindell et al., 2012; Rogelj et al., 2014b, 2015a; Stohl et al., 
2015; Collins et al., 2018).
For mitigation pathways that aim at halting and reversing radiative 
forcing increase during this century, the aerosol radiative forcing is a 
considerable source of uncertainty (Figure 2.2) (Samset et al., 2018; 
Smith et al., 2018). Indeed, reductions in SO2 (and NOx) emissions 
largely associated with fossil-fuel burning are expected to reduce the 
cooling effects of both aerosol radiative interactions and aerosol cloud 
interactions, leading to warming (Myhre et al., 2013; Samset et al., 
2018). A multimodel analysis (Myhre et al., 2017) and a study based 
on observational constraints (Malavelle et al., 2017) largely support 
the AR5 best estimate and uncertainty range of aerosol forcing. 
The partitioning of total aerosol radiative forcing between aerosol 
precursor emissions is important (Ghan et al., 2013; Jones et al., 
2018; Smith et al., 2018) as this affects the estimate of the mitigation 
potential from different sectors that have aerosol precursor emission 
sources. The total aerosol effective radiative forcing change in stringent 
mitigation pathways is expected to be dominated by the effects from 
the phase-out of SO2, although the magnitude of this aerosol-warming

anthropogenic sources (solid lines) and for non-CO2 agents only (dashed lines), as 
represented by MAGICC (red) and FAIR (blue) relative to 2010, respectively. Vertical

effect depends on how much of the present-day aerosol cooling is 
attributable to SO2, particularly the cooling associated with aerosol–
cloud interaction (Figure 2.2). Regional differences in the linearity of 
aerosol–cloud interactions (Carslaw et al., 2013; Kretzschmar et al., 
2017) make it difficult to separate the role of individual precursors. 
Precursors that are not fully mitigated will continue to affect the 
Earth system. If, for example, the role of nitrate aerosol cooling is at 
the strongest end of the assessed IPCC AR5 uncertainty range, future 
temperature increases may be more modest if ammonia emissions 
continue to rise (Hauglustaine et al., 2014). 
Figure 2.2 shows that there are substantial differences in the evolution 
of estimated effective radiative forcing of non-CO2 forcers between 
MAGICC and FAIR. These forcing differences result in MAGICC 
simulating a larger warming trend in the near term compared to both 
the FAIR model and the recent observed trends of 0.2°C per decade 
reported in Chapter 1 (Figure 2.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1, 
Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1.3). The aerosol effective forcing is stronger in 
MAGICC compared to either FAIR or the AR5 best estimate, though it 
is still well within the AR5 uncertainty range (Supplementary Material 
2.SM.1.1.1). A recent revision (Etminan et al., 2016) increases the 
methane forcing by 25%. This revision is used in the FAIR but not in the 
AR5 setup of MAGICC that is applied here. Other structural differences 
exist in how the two models relate emissions to concentrations that 
contribute to differences in forcing (see Supplementary Material 
2.SM.1.1.1).
Non-CO2 climate forcers exhibit a greater geographical variation in 
radiative forcings than CO2, which leads to important uncertainties in the 
temperature response  (Myhre et al., 2013). This uncertainty increases 
the relative uncertainty of the temperature pathways associated with 
low emission scenarios compared to high emission scenarios (Clarke 
et al., 2014). It is also important to note that geographical patterns 
of temperature change and other climate responses, especially those 
related to precipitation, depend significantly on the forcing mechanism 
(Myhre et al., 2013; Shindell et al., 2015; Marvel et al., 2016; Samset et 
al., 2016) (see also Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2.2).
2.2.1.2 Geophysical uncertainties: climate and Earth system 
feedbacks
Climate sensitivity uncertainty impacts future projections as well as 
carbon-budget estimates (Schneider et al., 2017). AR5 assessed the 
equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to be likely in the 1.5°–4.5°C 
range, extremely unlikely less than 1°C and very unlikely greater 
than 6°C. The lower bound of this estimate is lower than the range 
of CMIP5 models (Collins et al., 2013). The evidence for the 1.5°C 
lower bound on ECS in AR5 was based on analysis of energy-budget 
changes over the historical period. Work since AR5 has suggested 
that the climate sensitivity inferred from such changes has been 
lower than the 2 × CO2 climate sensitivity for known reasons (Forster, 
2016; Gregory and Andrews, 2016; Rugenstein et al., 2016; Armour, 
2017; Ceppi and Gregory, 2017; Knutti et al., 2017; Proistosescu and 
Huybers, 2017). Both a revised interpretation of historical estimates 
and other lines of evidence based on analysis of climate models with 
the best representation of today’s climate (Sherwood et al., 2014; 
Zhai et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2016; Brown and Caldeira, 2017; Knutti 
et al., 2017) suggest that the lower bound of ECS could be revised 
upwards, which would decrease the chances of limiting warming 
below 1.5°C in assessed pathways. However, such a reassessment has 
been challenged (Lewis and Curry, 2018), albeit from a single line of 
evidence. Nevertheless, it is premature to make a major revision to the 
lower bound. The evidence for a possible revision of the upper bound 
on ECS is less clear, with cases argued from different lines of evidence 
for both decreasing (Lewis and Curry, 2015, 2018; Cox et al., 2018) 
and increasing (Brown and Caldeira, 2017) the bound presented in the 
literature. The tools used in this chapter employ ECS ranges consistent 
with the AR5 assessment. The MAGICC ECS distribution has not been 
selected to explicitly reflect this but is nevertheless consistent (Rogelj 
et al., 2014a). The FAIR model used here to estimate carbon budgets 
explicitly constructs log-normal distributions of ECS and transient 
climate response based on a multi-parameter fit to the AR5 assessed 
ranges of climate sensitivity and individual historic effective radiative 
forcings (Smith et al., 2018) (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1.1).
Several feedbacks of the Earth system, involving the carbon cycle, non-
CO2 GHGs and/or aerosols, may also impact the future dynamics of the 
coupled carbon–climate system’s response to anthropogenic emissions. 
These feedbacks are caused by the effects of nutrient limitation (Duce et 
al., 2008; Mahowald et al., 2017), ozone exposure (de Vries et al., 2017), 
fire emissions (Narayan et al., 2007) and changes associated with 
natural aerosols (Cadule et al., 2009; Scott et al., 2018). Among these 
Earth system feedbacks, the importance of the permafrost feedback’s 
influence has been highlighted in recent studies. Combined evidence

from both models (MacDougall et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2017; Lowe 
and Bernie, 2018) and field studies (like Schädel et al., 2014; Schuur et 
al., 2015) shows high agreement that permafrost thawing will release 
both CO2 and CH4 as the Earth warms, amplifying global warming. This 
thawing could also release N2O (Voigt et al., 2017a, b). Field, laboratory 
and modelling studies estimate that the vulnerable fraction in 
permafrost is about 5–15% of the permafrost soil carbon (~5300–5600 
GtCO2 in Schuur et al., 2015) and that carbon emissions are expected to 
occur beyond 2100 because of system inertia and the large proportion 
of slowly decomposing carbon in permafrost (Schädel et al., 2014). 
Published model studies suggest that a large part of the carbon release 
to the atmosphere is in the form of CO2 (Schädel et al., 2016), while the 
amount of CH4 released by permafrost thawing is estimated to be much 
smaller than that CO2. Cumulative CH4 release by 2100 under RCP2.6 
ranges from 0.13 to 0.45 Gt of methane (Burke et al., 2012; Schneider 
von Deimling et al., 2012, 2015), with fluxes being the highest in the 
middle of the century because of maximum thermokarst lake extent by 
mid-century (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015). 
The reduced complexity climate models employed in this assessment 
do not take into account permafrost or non-CO2 Earth system 
feedbacks, although the MAGICC model has a permafrost module that 
can be enabled. Taking the current climate and Earth system feedbacks 
understanding together, there is a possibility that these models 
would underestimate the longer-term future temperature response to 
stringent emission pathways (Section 2.2.2).
2.2.2 
The Remaining 1.5°C Carbon Budget
2.2.2.1 Carbon budget estimates
Since the AR5, several approaches have been proposed to estimate 
carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C. Most of these 
approaches indirectly rely on the approximate linear relationship 
between peak global mean temperature and cumulative emissions 
of carbon (the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of 
carbon, TCRE) (Collins et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et 
al., 2016b), whereas others base their estimates on equilibrium climate 
sensitivity (Schneider et al., 2017). The AR5 employed two approaches 
to determine carbon budgets. Working Group I (WGI) computed 
carbon budgets from 2011 onwards for various levels of warming 
relative to the 1861–1880 period using RCP8.5 (Meinshausen et al., 
2011b; Stocker et al., 2013), whereas WGIII estimated their budgets 
from a set of available pathways that were assessed to have a >50% 
probability to exceed 1.5°C by mid-century, and return to 1.5°C or 
below in 2100 with greater than 66% probability (Clarke et al., 2014). 
These differences made AR5 WGI and WGIII carbon budgets difficult to 
compare as they are calculated over different time periods, are derived 
from a different sets of multi-gas and aerosol emission scenarios, 
and use different concepts of carbon budgets (exceedance for WGI, 
avoidance for WGIII) (Rogelj et al., 2016b; Matthews et al., 2017). 
Carbon budgets can be derived from CO2-only experiments as well 
as from multi-gas and aerosol scenarios. Some published estimates 
of carbon budgets compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C refer to budgets 
for CO2-induced warming only, and hence do not take into account 
the contribution of non-CO2 climate forcers (Allen et al., 2009; 
Matthews et al., 2009; Zickfeld et al., 2009; IPCC, 2013a). However, 
because the projected changes in non-CO2 climate forcers tend to 
amplify future warming, CO2-only carbon budgets overestimate the 
total net cumulative carbon emissions compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C 
(Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016b; Matthews et al., 2017; 
Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018). 
Since the AR5, many estimates of the remaining carbon budget for 
1.5°C have been published (Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; MacDougall 
et al., 2015; Peters, 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016b, 2018; Matthews et al., 
2017; Millar et al., 2017; Goodwin et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018b; 
Lowe and Bernie, 2018; Mengis et al., 2018; Millar and Friedlingstein, 
2018; Schurer et al., 2018; Séférian et al., 2018; Tokarska and Gillett, 
2018; Tokarska et al., 2018). These estimates cover a wide range as a 
result of differences in the models used, and of methodological choices, 
as well as physical uncertainties. Some estimates are exclusively model-
based while others are based on observations or on a combination of 
both. Remaining carbon budgets limiting warming below 1.5°C or 2°C 
that are derived from Earth system models of intermediate complexity 
(MacDougall et al., 2015; Goodwin et al., 2018a), IAMs (Luderer et al., 
2018; Rogelj et al., 2018), or are based on Earth-system model results 
(Lowe and Bernie, 2018; Séférian et al., 2018; Tokarska and Gillett, 
2018) give remaining carbon budgets of the same order of magnitude 
as the IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report (SYR) estimates (IPCC, 2014a). 
This is unsurprising as similar sets of models were used for the AR5 
(IPCC, 2013b). The range of variation across models stems mainly from 
either the inclusion or exclusion of specific Earth system feedbacks 
(MacDougall et al., 2015; Burke et al., 2017; Lowe and Bernie, 2018) or 
different budget definitions (Rogelj et al., 2018).
In contrast to the model-only estimates discussed above and employed 
in the AR5, this report additionally uses observations to inform its 
evaluation of the remaining carbon budget. Table 2.2 shows that the 
assessed range of remaining carbon budgets consistent with 1.5°C 
or 2°C is larger than the AR5 SYR estimate and is part way towards 
estimates constrained by recent observations (Millar et al., 2017; 
Goodwin et al., 2018a; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). Figure 2.3 illustrates 
that the change since AR5 is, in very large part, due to the application 
of a more recent observed baseline to the historic temperature change 
and cumulative emissions; here adopting the baseline period of 2006–
2015 (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1). AR5 SYR Figures SPM.10 and 2.3 
already illustrated the discrepancy between models and observations, 
but did not apply this as a correction to the carbon budget because they 
were being used to illustrate the overall linear relationship between 
warming and cumulative carbon emissions in the CMIP5 models since 
1870, and were not specifically designed to quantify residual carbon 
budgets relative to the present for ambitious temperature goals. The 
AR5 SYR estimate was also dependent on a subset of Earth system 
models illustrated in Figure 2.3 of this report. Although, as outlined 
below and in Table 2.2, considerably uncertainties remain, there is high 
agreement across various lines of evidence assessed in this report that 
the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C or 2°C would be larger than 
the estimates at the time of the AR5. However, the overall remaining 
budget for 2100 is assessed to be smaller than that derived from the 
recent observational-informed estimates, as Earth system feedbacks 
such as permafrost thawing reduce the budget applicable to centennial 
scales (see Section 2.2.2.2).

2.2.2.2 CO2 and non-CO2 contributions to the remaining 
carbon budget
A remaining carbon budget can be estimated from calculating the 
amount of CO2 emissions consistent (given a certain value of TCRE) 
with an allowable additional amount of warming. Here, the allowable 
warming is the 1.5°C warming threshold minus the current warming 
taken as the 2006–2015 average, with a further amount removed to 
account for the estimated non-CO2 temperature contribution to the 
remaining warming (Peters, 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016b). This assessment 
uses the TCRE range from AR5 WGI (Collins et al., 2013) supported 
by estimates of non-CO2 contributions that are based on published 
methods and integrated pathways (Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Allen et 
al., 2016, 2018; Peters, 2016; Smith et al., 2018). Table 2.2 and Figure 
2.3 show the assessed remaining carbon budgets and key uncertainties 
for a set of additional warming levels relative to the 2006–2015 period 
(see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1.2 for details). With an assessed 
historical warming of 0.87°C ± 0.12°C from 1850–1900 to 2006–2015 
(Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1), 0.63°C of additional warming would be

averaged near-surface air temperature response to cumulative CO2 emissions plus non-CO2 forcers as assessed in Figure SPM10 of WGI AR5, except that points marked with 
years relate to a particular year, unlike in WGI AR5 Figure SPM.10, where each point relates to the mean over the previous decade. The AR5 data was derived from 15 Earth 
system models and 5 Earth system models of Intermediate Complexity for the historic observations (black) and RCP8.5 scenario (red), and the red shaded plume shows the 
range across the models as presented in the AR5. The purple shaded plume and the line are indicative of the temperature response to cumulative CO2 emissions and non-CO2 
warming adopted in this report. The non-CO2 warming contribution is averaged from the MAGICC and FAIR models, and the purple shaded range assumes the AR5 WGI TCRE 
distribution (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1.2). The 2010 observation of surface temperature change (0.97°C based on 2006–2015 mean compared to 1850–1900, Chapter 
1, Section 1.2.1) and cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from 1876 to the end of 2010 of 1,930 GtCO2 (Le Quéré et al., 2018) is shown as a filled purple diamond. The value 
for 2017 based on the latest cumulative carbon emissions up to the end of 2017 of 2,220 GtCO2 (Version 1.3 accessed 22 May 2018) and a surface temperature anomaly of 
1.1°C based on an assumed temperature increase of 0.2°C per decade is shown as a hollow purple diamond. The thin blue line shows annual observations, with CO2 emissions 
from Le Quéré et al. (2018) and estimated globally averaged near-surface temperature from scaling the incomplete coverage and blended HadCRUT4 dataset in Chapter 1. The 
thin black line shows the CMIP5 multimodel mean estimate with CO2 emissions also from (Le Quéré et al., 2018). The thin black line shows the GMST historic temperature trends 
from Chapter 1, which give lower temperature changes up to 2006–2015 of 0.87°C and would lead to a larger remaining carbon budget. The dotted black lines illustrate the 
remaining carbon budget estimates for 1.5°C given in Table 2.2. Note these remaining budgets exclude possible Earth system feedbacks that could reduce the budget, such as 
CO2 and CH4 release from permafrost thawing and tropical wetlands (see Section 2.2.2.2).
approximately consistent with a global mean temperature increase 
of 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels. For this level of additional 
warming, remaining carbon budgets have been estimated (Table 2.2, 
Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1.2). 
The remaining carbon budget calculation presented in the Table 
2.2 and illustrated in Figure 2.3 does not consider additional Earth 
system feedbacks such as permafrost thawing. These are uncertain 
but estimated to reduce the remaining carbon budget by an order of 
magnitude of about 100 GtCO2 and more thereafter. Accounting for 
such feedbacks would make the carbon budget more applicable for 
2100 temperature targets, but would also increase uncertainty (Table 
2.2 and see below). Excluding such feedbacks, the assessed range for 
the remaining carbon budget is estimated to be 840, 580, and 420 
GtCO2 for the 33rd, 50th and, 67th percentile of TCRE, respectively, 
with a median non-CO2 warming contribution and starting from 1 
January 2018 onward. Consistent with the approach used in the 
IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2013b), the latter estimates 
use global near-surface air temperatures both over the ocean and 
106

over land to estimate global surface temperature change since pre-
industrial. The global warming from the pre-industrial period until the 
2006–2015 reference period is estimated to amount to 0.97°C with 
an uncertainty range of about ±0.1°C (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2.1). 
Three methodological improvements lead to these estimates of the 
remaining carbon budget being about 300 GtCO2 larger than those 
reported in Table 2.2 of the IPCC AR5 SYR (IPCC, 2014a) (medium 
confidence). The AR5 used 15 Earth System Models (ESM) and 5 
Earth-system Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC) to derive an 
estimate of the remaining carbon budget. Their approach hence made 
implicit assumptions about the level of warming to date, the future 
contribution of non-CO2 emissions, and the temperature response 
to CO2 (TCRE). In this report, each of these aspects are considered 
explicitly. When estimating global warming until the 2006–2015 
reference period as a blend of near-surface air temperature over land 
and sea-ice regions, and sea-surface temperature over open ocean, 
by averaging the four global mean surface temperature time series 
listed in Chapter 1 Section 1.2.1, the global warming would amount 
to 0.87°C ±0.1°C. Using the latter estimate of historical warming and 
projecting global warming using global near-surface air temperatures 
from model projections leads to remaining carbon budgets for limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C of 1080, 770, and 570 GtCO2 for the 33rd, 
50th, and 67th percentile of TCRE, respectively. Note that future 
research and ongoing observations over the next years will provide a 
better indication as to how the 2006–2015 base period compares with 
the long-term trends and might affect the budget estimates. Similarly, 
improved understanding in Earth system feedbacks would result in a 
better quantification of their impacts on remaining carbon budgets for 
1.5°C and 2°C. 
After TCRE uncertainty, a major additional source of uncertainty is the 
magnitude of non-CO2 forcing and its contribution to the temperature 
change between the present day and the time of peak warming. 
Integrated emissions pathways can be used to ensure consistency 
between CO2 and non-CO2 emissions (Bowerman et al., 2013; Collins 
et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Rogelj et al., 2014b, 2015a; Tokarska et 
al., 2018). Friedlingstein et al. (2014a) used pathways with limited to 
no climate mitigation to find a variation due to non-CO2 contributions 
of about ±33% for a 2°C carbon budget. Rogelj et al. (2016b) showed 
no particular bias in non-CO2 radiative forcing or warming at the time 
of exceedance of 2°C or at peak warming between scenarios with 
increasing emissions and strongly mitigated scenarios (consistent 
with Stocker et al., 2013). However, clear differences of the non-
CO2 warming contribution at the time of deriving a 2°C-consistent 
carbon budget were reported for the four RCPs. Although the spread 
in non-CO2 forcing across scenarios can be smaller in absolute terms 
at lower levels of cumulative emissions, it can be larger in relative 
terms compared to the remaining carbon budget (Stocker et al., 2013; 
Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016b). Tokarska and Gillett 
(2018) find no statistically significant differences in 1.5°C-consistent 
cumulative emissions budgets when calculated for different RCPs from 
consistent sets of CMIP5 simulations. 
The mitigation pathways assessed in this report indicate that emissions 
of non-CO2 forcers contribute an average additional warming of around 
0.15°C relative to 2006–2015 at the time of net zero CO2 emissions, 
reducing the remaining carbon budget by roughly 320 GtCO2. This 
arises from a weakening of aerosol cooling and continued emissions 
of non-CO2 GHGs (Sections 2.2.1, 2.3.3). This non-CO2 contribution 
at the time of net zero CO2 emissions varies by about ±0.1°C across 
scenarios, resulting in a carbon budget uncertainty of about ±250 
GtCO2, and takes into account marked reductions in methane emissions 
(Section 2.3.3). If these reductions are not achieved, remaining carbon 
budgets are further reduced. Uncertainties in the non-CO2 forcing and 
temperature response are asymmetric and can influence the remaining 
carbon budget by −400 to +200 GtCO2, with the uncertainty in aerosol 
radiative forcing being the largest contributing factor (Table 2.2). The 
MAGICC and FAIR models in their respective parameter setups and 
model versions used to assess the non-CO2 warming contribution give 
noticeable different non-CO2 effective radiative forcing and warming 
for the same scenarios while both being within plausible ranges of 
future response (Figure 2.2 and Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1, 
2.SM.1.2). For this assessment, it is premature to assess the accuracy 
of their results, so it is assumed that both are equally representative 
of possible futures. Their non-CO2 warming estimates are therefore 
averaged for the carbon budget assessment and their differences used 
to guide the uncertainty assessment of the role of non-CO2 forcers. 
Nevertheless, the findings are robust enough to give high confidence 
that the changing emissions of non-CO2 forcers (particularly the 
reduction in cooling aerosol precursors) cause additional near-term 
warming and reduce the remaining carbon budget compared to the 
CO2-only budget. 
TCRE uncertainty directly impacts carbon budget estimates (Peters, 
2016; Matthews et al., 2017; Millar and Friedlingstein, 2018). Based 
on multiple lines of evidence, AR5 WGI assessed a likely range for 
TCRE of 0.2°–0.7°C per 1000 GtCO2 (Collins et al., 2013). The TCRE 
of the CMIP5 Earth system models ranges from 0.23°C to 0.66°C 
per 1000 GtCO2 (Gillett et al., 2013). At the same time, studies using 
observational constraints find best estimates of TCRE of 0.35°–0.41°C 
per 1000 GtCO2 (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Tachiiri et 
al., 2015; Millar and Friedlingstein, 2018). This assessment continues 
to use the assessed AR5 TCRE range under the working assumption 
that TCRE is normally distributed (Stocker et al., 2013). Observation-
based estimates have reported log-normal distributions of TCRE (Millar 
and Friedlingstein, 2018). Assuming a log-normal instead of normal 
distribution of the assessed AR5 TCRE range would result in about a 
200 GtCO2 increase for the median budget estimates but only about 
half at the 67th percentile, while historical temperature uncertainty 
and uncertainty in recent emissions contribute ±150 and ±50 GtCO2 
to the uncertainty, respectively (Table 2.2).
Calculating carbon budgets from the TCRE requires the assumption 
that the instantaneous warming in response to cumulative CO2 
emissions equals the long-term warming or, equivalently, that 
the residual warming after CO2 emissions cease is negligible. The 
magnitude of this residual warming, referred to as the zero-emission 
commitment, ranges from slightly negative (i.e., a slight cooling) 
to slightly positive for CO2 emissions up to present-day (Chapter 1, 
Section 1.2.4) (Lowe et al., 2009; Frölicher and Joos, 2010; Gillett et 
al., 2011; Matthews and Zickfeld, 2012). The delayed temperature 
change from a pulse CO2 emission introduces uncertainties in emission 
budgets, which have not been quantified in the literature for budgets 
consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. As a consequence, this 
107

Chapter 2
uncertainty does not affect our carbon budget estimates directly but 
it is included as an additional factor in the assessed Earth system 
feedback uncertainty (as detailed below) of roughly 100 GtCO2 on 
decadal time scales presented in Table 2.2.
Remaining carbon budgets are further influenced by Earth system 
feedbacks not accounted for in CMIP5 models, such as the permafrost 
carbon feedback (Friedlingstein et al., 2014b; MacDougall et al., 2015; 
Burke et al., 2017; Lowe and Bernie, 2018), and their influence on 
the TCRE. Lowe and Bernie (2018) used a simple climate sensitivity 
scaling approach to estimate that Earth system feedbacks (such as 
CO2 released by permafrost thawing or methane released by wetlands) 
could reduce carbon budgets for 1.5°C and 2°C by roughly 100 
GtCO2 on centennial time scales. Their findings are based on an older 
understanding of Earth system feedbacks (Arneth et al., 2010). This 
estimate is broadly supported by more recent analysis of individual 
feedbacks. Schädel et al. (2014) suggest an upper bound of 24.4 PgC 
(90 GtCO2) emitted from carbon release from permafrost over the next 
forty years for a RCP4.5 scenario. Burke et al. (2017) use a single model 
to estimate permafrost emissions between 0.3 and 0.6 GtCO2 y-1 from 
the point of 1.5°C stabilization, which would reduce the budget by 
around 20 GtCO2 by 2100. Comyn-Platt et al. (2018) include carbon 
and methane emissions from permafrost and wetlands and suggest the 
1.5°C remaining carbon budget is reduced by 116 GtCO2. Additionally, 
Mahowald et al. (2017) find there is possibility of 0.5–1.5 GtCO2 y-1 
being released from aerosol-biogeochemistry changes if aerosol 
emissions cease. In summary, these additional Earth system feedbacks 
taken together are assessed to reduce the remaining carbon budget 
applicable to 2100 by an order of magnitude of 100 GtCO2, compared 
to the budgets based on the assumption of a constant TCRE presented 
in Table 2.2 (limited evidence, medium agreement), leading to overall 
medium confidence in their assessed impact. After 2100, the impact 
of additional Earth system feedbacks is expected to further reduce the 
remaining carbon budget (medium confidence).
The uncertainties presented in Table 2.2 cannot be formally combined, 
but current understanding of the assessed geophysical uncertainties 
suggests at least a ±50% possible variation for remaining carbon 
budgets for 1.5°C-consistent pathways. By the end of 2017, 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the pre-industrial period are 
estimated to have amounted to approximately 2200 ±320 GtCO2 
(medium confidence) (Le Quéré et al., 2018). When put in the context 
of year-2017 CO2 emissions (about 42 GtCO2 yr-1, ±3 GtCO2 yr-1, high 
confidence) (Le Quéré et al., 2018), a remaining carbon budget of 
580 GtCO2 (420 GtCO2) suggests meeting net zero global CO2 emissions 
in about 30 years (20 years) following a linear decline starting from 
2018 (rounded to the nearest five years), with a variation of ±15–20 
years due to the geophysical uncertainties mentioned above (high 
confidence).
The remaining carbon budgets assessed in this section are consistent 
with limiting peak warming to the indicated levels of additional 
warming. However, if these budgets are exceeded and the use of 
CDR (see Sections 2.3 and 2.4) is envisaged to return cumulative 
CO2 emissions to within the carbon budget at a later point in time, 
additional uncertainties apply because the TCRE is different under 
increasing and decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to 
ocean thermal and carbon cycle inertia (Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; 
Krasting et al., 2014; Zickfeld et al., 2016). This asymmetrical behaviour 
makes carbon budgets path-dependent in the case of a budget and/or 
temperature overshoot (MacDougall et al., 2015). Although potentially 
large for scenarios with large overshoot (MacDougall et al., 2015), this 
path-dependence of carbon budgets has not been well quantified for 
1.5°C- and 2°C-consistent scenarios and as such remains an important 
knowledge gap. This assessment does not explicitly account for path 
dependence but takes it into consideration for its overall confidence 
assessment. 
This assessment finds a larger remaining budget from the 2006–2015 
base period than the 1.5°C and 2°C remaining budgets inferred from 
AR5 from the start of 2011, which were approximately 1000 GtCO2 
for the 2°C (66% of model simulations) and approximately 400 GtCO2 
for the 1.5°C budget (66% of model simulations). In contrast, this 
assessment finds approximately 1600 GtCO2 for the 2°C (66th TCRE 
percentile) and approximately 860 GtCO2 for the 1.5°C budget (66th 
TCRE percentile) from 2011. However, these budgets are not directly 
equivalent as AR5 reported budgets for fractions of CMIP5 simulations 
and other lines of evidence, while this report uses the assessed range 
of TCRE and an assessment of the non-CO2 contribution at net zero CO2 
emissions to provide remaining carbon budget estimates at various 
percentiles of TCRE. Furthermore, AR5 did not specify remaining 
budgets to carbon neutrality as we do here, but budgets until the time 
the temperature limit of interest was reached, assuming negligible zero 
emission commitment and taking into account the non-CO2 forcing at 
that point in time.
In summary, although robust physical understanding underpins the 
carbon budget concept, relative uncertainties become larger as a 
specific temperature limit is approached. For the budget, applicable 
to the mid-century, the main uncertainties relate to the TCRE, non-CO2 
emissions, radiative forcing and response. For 2100, uncertain Earth 
system feedbacks such as permafrost thawing would further reduce 
the available budget. The remaining budget is also conditional upon 
the choice of baseline, which is affected by uncertainties in both 
historical emissions, and in deriving the estimate of globally averaged 
human-induced warming. As a result, only medium confidence can be 
assigned to the assessed remaining budget values for 1.5°C and 2.0°C 
and their uncertainty.

*(1) Chapter 1 has assessed historical warming between the 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 periods to be 0.87°C with a ±0.12°C likely (1-standard deviation) range, and global near-surface air  
 
temperature to be 0.97°C. The temperature changes from the 2006–2015 period are expressed in changes of global near-surface air temperature.

2010. Since 1 January 2011, an additional 290 GtCO2 (270–310 GtCO2, one sigma range) has been emitted until the end of 2017 (Le Quéré et al., 2018).

2.3 
Overview of 1.5°C Mitigation Pathways 
Limiting global mean temperature increase at any level requires global 
CO2 emissions to become net zero at some point in the future (Zickfeld 
et al., 2009; Collins et al., 2013). At the same time, limiting the residual 
warming of short-lived non-CO2 emissions can be achieved by reducing 
their annual emissions as much as possible (Section 2.2, Cross-Chapter 
Box 2 in Chapter 1). This would require large-scale transformations of 
the global energy–agriculture–land-economy system, affecting the 
way in which energy is produced, agricultural systems are organized, 
and food, energy and materials are consumed (Clarke et al., 2014). This 
section assesses key properties of pathways consistent with limiting 
global mean temperature to 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels, 
including their underlying assumptions and variations.
Since the AR5, an extensive body of literature has appeared on integrated 
pathways consistent with 1.5°C (Section 2.1) (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; 
Akimoto et al., 2017; Löffler et al., 2017; Marcucci et al., 2017; Su et al., 
2017; Bauer et al., 2018; Bertram et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; Holz 
et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2018; Luderer et al., 2018; 
Strefler et al., 2018a; van Vuuren et al., 2018; Vrontisi et al., 2018; Zhang 
et al., 2018). These pathways have global coverage and represent all 
GHG-emitting sectors and their interactions. Such integrated pathways 
allow the exploration of the whole-system transformation, and hence 
provide the context in which the detailed sectoral transformations 
assessed in Section 2.4 of this chapter are taking place.
The overwhelming majority of published integrated pathways have 
been developed by global IAMs that represent key societal systems 
109

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
and their interactions, like the energy system, agriculture and land use, 
and the economy (see Section 6.2 in Clarke et al., 2014). Very often 
these models also include interactions with a representation of the 
geophysical system, for example, by including spatially explicit land 
models or carbon cycle and climate models. The complex features of 
these subsystems are approximated and simplified in these models. 
IAMs are briefly introduced in Section 2.1 and important knowledge 
gaps identified in Section 2.6. An overview to the use, scope and 
limitations of IAMs is provided in Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2.
The pathway literature is assessed in two ways in this section. First, 
various insights on specific questions reported by studies can be assessed 
to identify robust or divergent findings. Second, the combined body of 
scenarios can be assessed to identify salient features of pathways in line 
with a specific climate goal across a wide range of models. The latter 
can be achieved by assessing pathways available in the database to 
this assessment (Section 2.1, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2–4). The 
ensemble of scenarios available to this assessment is an ensemble of 
opportunity: it is a collection of scenarios from a diverse set of studies 
that was not developed with a common set of questions and a statistical 
analysis of outcomes in mind. This means that ranges can be useful to 
identify robust and sensitive features across available scenarios and 
contributing modelling frameworks, but do not lend themselves to a 
statistical interpretation. To understand the reasons underlying the ranges, 
an assessment of the underlying scenarios and studies is required. To this 
end, this section highlights illustrative pathway archetypes that help to 
clarify the variation in assessed ranges for 1.5°C-consistent pathways.
2.3.1 
Range of Assumptions Underlying 1.5°C Pathways 
Earlier assessments have highlighted that there is no single pathway to 
achieve a specific climate objective (e.g., Clarke et al., 2014). Pathways 
depend on the underlying development processes, and societal 
choices, which affect the drivers of projected future baseline emissions. 
Furthermore, societal choices also affect climate change solutions in 
pathways, like the technologies that are deployed, the scale at which 
they are deployed, or whether solutions are globally coordinated.  
A key finding is that 1.5°C-consistent pathways could be identified 
under a considerable range of assumptions in model studies despite 
the tightness of the 1.5°C emissions budget (Figures 2.4, 2.5) (Rogelj 
et al., 2018).
The AR5 provided an overview of how differences in model structure 
and assumptions can influence the outcome of transformation 
pathways (Section 6.2 in Clarke et al., 2014, as well as Table A.II.14 
in Krey et al., 2014b) and this was further explored by the modelling 
community in recent years with regard to, e.g., socio-economic drivers 
(Kriegler et al., 2016; Marangoni et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017), 
technology assumptions (Bosetti et al., 2015; Creutzig et al., 2017; 
Pietzcker et al., 2017), and behavioural factors (van Sluisveld et al., 
2016; McCollum et al., 2017).  
2.3.1.1 Socio-economic drivers and the demand for 
energy and land in 1.5°C pathways
There is deep uncertainty about the ways humankind will use energy 
and land in the 21st century. These ways are intricately linked to 
future population levels, secular trends in economic growth and 
income convergence, behavioural change and technological progress. 
These dimensions have been recently explored in the context of 
the SSPs (Kriegler et al., 2012; O’Neill et al., 2014), which provide 
narratives (O’Neill et al., 2017) and quantifications (Crespo Cuaresma, 
2017; Dellink et al., 2017; KC and Lutz, 2017; Leimbach et al., 2017; 
Riahi et al., 2017) of different world futures across which scenario 
dimensions are varied to explore differential challenges to adaptation 
and mitigation (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). This framework 
is increasingly adopted by IAMs to systematically explore the impact 
of socio-economic assumptions on mitigation pathways (Riahi et al., 
2017), including 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Rogelj et al., 2018). The 
narratives describe five worlds (SSP1–5) with different socio-economic 
predispositions to mitigate and adapt to climate change (Table 2.3). As 
a result, population and economic growth projections can vary strongly 
across integrated scenarios, including available 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways (Figure 2.4). For example, based on alternative future 
fertility, mortality, migration and educational assumptions, population 
projections vary between 8.5 and 10.0 billion people by 2050 and 
between 6.9 and 12.6 billion people by 2100 across the SSPs. An 
important factor for these differences is future female educational 
attainment, with higher attainment leading to lower fertility rates and 
therefore decreased population growth up to a level of 1 billion people 
by 2050 (Lutz and KC, 2011; Snopkowski et al., 2016; KC and Lutz, 
2017). Consistent with population development, GDP per capita also 
varies strongly in SSP baselines, ranging from about 20 to more than 
50 thousand USD2010 per capita in 2050 (in purchasing power parity 
values, PPP), in part driven by assumptions on human development, 
technological progress and development convergence between and 
within regions (Crespo Cuaresma, 2017; Dellink et al., 2017; Leimbach 
et al., 2017). Importantly, none of the GDP projections in the mitigation 
pathway literature assessed in this chapter included the feedback of 
climate damages on economic growth (Hsiang et al., 2017). 
Baseline projections for energy-related GHG emissions are sensitive to 
economic growth assumptions, while baseline projections for land-use 
emissions are more directly affected by population growth (assuming 
unchanged land productivity and per capita demand for agricultural 
products) (Kriegler et al., 2016). SSP-based modelling studies of 
mitigation pathways have identified high challenges to mitigation 
for worlds with a focus on domestic issues and regional security 
combined with high population growth (SSP3), and for worlds with 
rapidly growing resource and fossil-fuel intensive consumption (SSP5) 
(Riahi et al., 2017). No model could identify a 2°C-consistent pathway 
for SSP3, and high mitigation costs were found for SSP5. This picture 
translates to 1.5°C-consistent pathways that have to remain within 
even tighter emissions constraints (Rogelj et al., 2018). No model 
found a 1.5°C-consistent pathway for SSP3 and some models could not 
identify 1.5°C-consistent pathways for SSP5 (2 of 4 models, compared 
to 1 of 4 models for 2°C-consistent pathways). The modelling analysis 
also found that the effective control of land-use emissions becomes 
even more critical in 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Due to high inequality 
levels in SSP4, land use can be less well managed. This caused 2 of 
3 models to no longer find an SSP4-based 1.5°C-consistent pathway 
even though they identified SSP4-based 2°C-consistent pathways at 
relatively moderate mitigation costs (Riahi et al., 2017). Rogelj et al. 
(2018) further reported that all six participating models identified 
110
Chapter 2

2
1.5°C-consistent pathways in a sustainability oriented world (SSP1) and 
four of six models found 1.5°C-consistent pathways for middle-of-the-
road developments (SSP2). These results show that 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways can be identified under a broad range of assumptions, but 
that lack of global cooperation (SSP3), high inequality (SSP4) and/or 
high population growth (SSP3) that limit the ability to control land use 
emissions, and rapidly growing resource-intensive consumption (SSP5) 
are key impediments. 
Figure 2.4 compares the range of underlying socio-economic 
developments as well as energy and food demand in available 
1.5°C-consistent pathways with the full set of published scenarios 
that were submitted to this assessment. While 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways broadly cover the full range of population and economic 
growth developments (except for the high population development 
in SSP3-based scenarios), they tend to cluster on the lower end for 
energy and food demand. They still encompass, however, a wide range 
of developments from decreasing to increasing demand levels relative 
to today. For the purpose of this assessment, a set of four illustrative 
1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes were selected to show the 
variety of underlying assumptions and characteristics (Figure 2.4). They 
comprise three 1.5°C-consistent pathways based on the SSPs (Rogelj 
et al., 2018): a sustainability oriented scenario (S1 based on SSP1) 
developed with the AIM model (Fujimori, 2017), a fossil-fuel intensive 
and high energy demand scenario (S5, based on SSP5) developed with 
the REMIND-MAgPIE model (Kriegler et al., 2017), and a middle-of-
the-road scenario (S2, based on SSP2) developed with the MESSAGE-
GLOBIOM model (Fricko et al., 2017). In addition, we include a scenario 
with low energy demand (LED) (Grubler et al., 2018), which reflects 
recent literature with a stronger focus on demand-side measures 
(Bertram et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; van Vuuren 
et al., 2018). Pathways LED, S1, S2, and S5 are referred to as P1, P2, P3, 
and P4 in the Summary for Policymakers.
2.3.1.2 Mitigation options in 1.5°C pathways
In the context of 1.5°C pathways, the portfolio of mitigation options 
available to the model becomes an increasingly important factor. IAMs 
include a wide variety of mitigation options, as well as measures that 
achieve CDR from the atmosphere (Krey et al., 2014a, b) (see Chapter 4, 
Section 4.3 for a broad assessment of available mitigation measures). 
For the purpose of this assessment, we elicited technology availability 
in models that submitted scenarios to the database as summarized 
in Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2, where a detailed picture of the 
technology variety underlying available 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
is provided. Modelling choices on whether a particular mitigation 
measure is included are influenced by an assessment of its global 
mitigation potential, the availability of data and literature describing

its techno-economic characteristics and future prospects, and the 
computational challenge of representing the measure, e.g., in terms of 
required spatio-temporal and process detail.
This elicitation (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2) confirms that 
IAMs cover most supply-side mitigation options on the process level, 
while many demand-side options are treated as part of underlying 
assumptions, which can be varied (Clarke et al., 2014). In recent years, 
there has been increasing attention on improving the modelling 
of integrating variable renewable energy into the power system 
(Creutzig et al., 2017; Luderer et al., 2017; Pietzcker et al., 2017) and 
of behavioural change and other factors influencing future demand 
for energy and food (van Sluisveld et al., 2016; McCollum et al., 2017; 
Weindl et al., 2017), including in the context of 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways (Grubler et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). The literature 
on the many diverse CDR options only recently started to develop 
strongly (Minx et al., 2017) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 for a detailed 
assessment), and hence these options are only partially included in 
IAM analyses. IAMs mostly incorporate afforestation and bioenergy 
with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and only in few cases also 
include direct air capture with CCS (DACCS) (Chen and Tavoni, 2013; 
Marcucci et al., 2017; Strefler et al., 2018b). 
Several studies have either directly or indirectly explored the 
dependence of 1.5°C-consistent pathways on specific (sets of) 
mitigation and CDR technologies (Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 
2018; Holz et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Liu et al., 2018; Rogelj et 
al., 2018; Strefler et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018). However, there 
are a few potentially disruptive technologies that are typically not yet 
well covered in IAMs and that have the potential to alter the shape of 
mitigation pathways beyond the ranges in the IAM-based literature. 
Those are also included in Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2. The 
configuration of carbon-neutral energy systems projected in mitigation 
pathways can vary widely, but they all share a substantial reliance 
on bioenergy under the assumption of effective land-use emissions 
control. There are other configurations with less reliance on bioenergy 
that are not yet comprehensively covered by global mitigation pathway 
modelling. One approach is to dramatically reduce and electrify energy 
demand for transportation and manufacturing to levels that make 
residual non-electric fuel use negligible or replaceable by limited 
amounts of electrolytic hydrogen. Such an approach is presented in 
a first-of-its kind low-energy-demand scenario (Grubler et al., 2018) 
which is part of this assessment. Other approaches rely less on energy 
demand reductions, but employ cheap renewable electricity to push 
the boundaries of electrification in the industry and transport sectors 
(Breyer et al., 2017; Jacobson, 2017). In addition, these approaches 
deploy renewable-based Power-2-X (read: Power to “x”) technologies 
to substitute residual fossil-fuel use (Brynolf et al., 2018). An important 
element of carbon-neutral Power-2-X applications is the combination 
of hydrogen generated from renewable electricity and CO2 captured 
from the atmosphere (Zeman and Keith, 2008). Alternatively, algae 
are considered as a bioenergy source with more limited implications 
112

for land use and agricultural systems than energy crops (Williams and 
Laurens, 2010; Walsh et al., 2016; Greene et al., 2017).
Furthermore, a range of measures could radically reduce agricultural 
and land-use emissions and are not yet well-covered in IAM modelling. 
This includes plant-based proteins (Joshi and Kumar, 2015) and cultured 
meat (Post, 2012) with the potential to substitute for livestock products 
at much lower GHG footprints (Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos, 2011). 
Large-scale use of synthetic or algae-based proteins for animal feed 
could free pasture land for other uses (Madeira et al., 2017; Pikaar et al., 
2018). Novel technologies such as methanogen inhibitors and vaccines 
(Wedlock et al., 2013; Hristov et al., 2015; Herrero et al., 2016; Subharat 
et al., 2016) as well as synthetic and biological nitrification inhibitors 
(Subbarao et al., 2013; Di and Cameron, 2016) could substantially 
reduce future non-CO2 emissions from agriculture if commercialized 
successfully. Enhancing carbon sequestration in soils (Paustian et al., 
2016; Frank et al., 2017; Zomer et al., 2017) can provide the dual benefit 
of CDR and improved soil quality. A range of conservation, restoration 
and land management options can also increase terrestrial carbon 
uptake (Griscom et al., 2017). In addition, the literature discusses 
CDR measures to permanently sequester atmospheric carbon in rocks 
(mineralization and enhanced weathering, see Chapter 4, Section 
4.3.7) as well as carbon capture and usage in long-lived products like 
plastics and carbon fibres (Mazzotti et al., 2005; Hartmann et al., 2013). 
Progress in the understanding of the technical viability, economics and 
sustainability of these ways to achieve and maintain carbon neutral 
energy and land use can affect the characteristics, costs and feasibility 
of 1.5°C-consistent pathways significantly. 
2.3.1.3 Policy assumptions in 1.5°C pathways
Besides assumptions related to socio-economic drivers and mitigation 
technology, scenarios are also subject to assumptions about the 
mitigation policies that can be put in place. Mitigation policies can 
either be applied immediately in scenarios or follow staged or delayed 
approaches. Policies can span many sectors (e.g., economy-wide carbon 
pricing), or policies can be applicable to specific sectors only (like the 
energy sector) with other sectors (e.g., the agricultural or the land-use 
sector) treated differently. These variations can have an important 
impact on the ability of models to generate scenarios compatible with 
stringent climate targets like 1.5°C (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 
2013b; Bertram et al., 2015b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Michaelowa et al., 
2018). In the scenario ensemble available to this assessment, several 
variations of near-term mitigation policy implementation can be found: 
immediate and cross-sectoral global cooperation from 2020 onward 
towards a global climate objective, a phase-in of globally coordinated 
mitigation policy from 2020 to 2040, and a more short-term oriented 
and regionally diverse global mitigation policy, following NDCs until 
2030 (Kriegler et al., 2018a; Luderer et al., 2018; McCollum et al., 2018; 
Rogelj et al., 2018; Strefler et al., 2018b). For example, the above-
mentioned SSP quantifications assume regionally scattered mitigation 
policies until 2020, and vary in global convergence thereafter (Kriegler 
et al., 2014a; Riahi et al., 2017). The impact of near-term policy choices 
on 1.5°C-consistent pathways is discussed in Section 2.3.5. The 
literature has also explored 1.5°C-consistent pathways that build on 
a portfolio of policy approaches until 2030, including the combination 
of regulatory policies and carbon pricing (Kriegler et al., 2018a), 
and a variety of ancillary policies to safeguard other sustainable 
development goals (Bertram et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). 
A further discussion of policy implications of 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
is provided in Section 2.5.1, while a general discussion of policies and 
options to strengthen action are subject of Chapter 4, Section 4.4.  
2.3.2 
Key Characteristics of 1.5°C Pathways
1.5°C-consistent pathways are characterized by a rapid phase out 
of CO2 emissions and deep emissions reductions in other GHGs and 
climate forcers (Section 2.2.2 and 2.3.3). This is achieved by broad 
transformations in the energy; industry; transport; buildings; and 
agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU) sectors (Section 2.4) 
(Bauer et al., 2018; Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; Kriegler 
et al., 2018b; Liu et al., 2018; Luderer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 
2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Here we assess 
1.5°C-consistent pathways with and without overshoot during 
the 21st century. One study also explores pathways overshooting 
1.5°C for longer than the 21st century (Akimoto et al., 2017), but 
these are not considered 1.5°C-consistent pathways in this report 
(Chapter 1, Section 1.1.3). This subsection summarizes robust and 
varying properties of 1.5°C-consistent pathways regarding system 
transformations, emission reductions and overshoot. It aims to provide 
an introduction to the detailed assessment of the emissions evolution 
(Section 2.3.3), CDR deployment (Section 2.3.4), energy (Section 2.4.1, 
2.4.2), industry (2.4.3.1), buildings (2.4.3.2), transport (2.4.3.3) and 
land-use transformations (Section 2.4.4) in 1.5°C-consistent pathways. 
Throughout Sections 2.3 and 2.4, pathway properties are highlighted 
with four 1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes (LED, S1, S2, S5; referred 
to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for Policymakers) covering a 
wide range of different socio-economic and technology assumptions 
(Figure 2.5, Section 2.3.1). 
2.3.2.1 Variation in system transformations underlying 1.5°C 
pathways
Be it for the energy, transport, buildings, industry, or AFOLU sector, 
the literature shows that multiple options and choices are available in 
each of these sectors to pursue stringent emissions reductions (Section 
2.3.1.2, Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2, Chapter 4, Section 4.3). 
Because the overall emissions total under a pathway is limited by a 
geophysical carbon budget (Section 2.2.2), choices in one sector affect 
the efforts that are required from others (Clarke et al., 2014). A robust 
feature of 1.5°C-consistent pathways, as highlighted by the set of 
pathway archetypes in Figure 2.5, is a virtually full decarbonization of the 
power sector around mid-century, a feature shared with 2°C-consistent 
pathways. The additional emissions reductions in 1.5°C-consistent 
compared to 2°C-consistent pathways come predominantly from the 
transport and industry sectors (Luderer et al., 2018). Emissions can be 
apportioned differently across sectors, for example, by focussing on 
reducing the overall amount of CO2 produced in the energy end-use 
sectors, and using limited contributions of CDR by the AFOLU sector 
(afforestation and reforestation, S1 and LED pathways in Figure 2.5) 
(Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018), or 
by being more lenient about the amount of CO2 that continues to 
be produced in the above-mentioned end-use sectors (both by 2030 
and mid-century) and strongly relying on technological CDR options

like BECCS (S2 and S5 pathways in Figure 2.5) (Luderer et al., 2018; 
Rogelj et al., 2018). Major drivers of these differences are assumptions 
about energy and food demand and the stringency of near-term climate 
policy (see the difference between early action in the scenarios S1, 
LED and more moderate action until 2030 in the scenarios S2, S5). 
Furthermore, the carbon budget in each of these pathways depends 
also on the non-CO2 mitigation measures implemented in each of them, 
particularly for agricultural emissions (Sections 2.2.2, 2.3.3) (Gernaat et 
al., 2015). Those pathways differ not only in terms of their deployment 
of mitigation and CDR measures (Sections 2.3.4 and 2.4), but also in 
terms of the resulting temperature overshoot (Figure 2.1). Furthermore, 
they have very different implications for the achievement of sustainable 
development objectives, as further discussed in Section 2.5.3.
2.3.2.2 Pathways keeping warming below 1.5°C or temporarily 
overshooting it
This subsection explores the conditions that would need to be fulfilled 
to stay below 1.5°C warming without overshoot. As discussed in Section 
2.2.2, to keep warming below 1.5°C with a two-in-three (one-in-two) 
chance, the cumulative amount of CO2 emissions from 2018 onwards 
need to remain below a carbon budget of 420 (580) GtCO2; accounting 
for the effects of additional Earth system feedbacks until 2100 reduces 
this estimate by 100 GtCO2. Based on the current state of knowledge, 
exceeding this remaining carbon budget at some point in time would 
give a one-in-three (one-in-two) chance that the 1.5°C limit is overshot 
(Table 2.2). For comparison, around 290 ± 20 (1 standard deviation 
range) GtCO2 have been emitted in the years 2011–2017, with annual 
CO2 emissions in 2017 around 42 ± 3 GtCO2 yr−1 (Jackson et al., 2017; 
Le Quéré et al., 2018). Committed fossil-fuel emissions from existing 
fossil-fuel infrastructure as of 2010 have been estimated at around 
500 ± 200 GtCO2 (with about 200 GtCO2 already emitted through 
2017) (Davis and Caldeira, 2010). Coal-fired power plants contribute 
the largest part. Committed emissions from existing coal-fired power 
plants built through the end of 2016 are estimated to add up to roughly 
200 GtCO2, and a further 100–150 GtCO2 from coal-fired power plants 
under construction or planned (González-Eguino et al., 2017; Edenhofer 
et al., 2018). However, there has been a marked slowdown of planned 
coal-power projects in recent years, and some estimates indicate that 
the committed emissions from coal plants that are under construction 
or planned have halved since 2015 (Shearer et al., 2018). Despite these 
uncertainties, the committed fossil-fuel emissions are assessed to 
already amount to more than two thirds (half) of the remaining carbon 
budget.
An important question is to what extent the nationally determined 
contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement are aligned with the 
remaining carbon budget. It was estimated that the NDCs, if successfully

1.5°C-low-overshoot (OS), and 1.5°C-high-OS pathways, with the four illustrative 1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes of this chapter highlighted. Ranges at the bottom of the 
top-left panel show the 10th–90th percentile range (thin line) and interquartile range (thick line) of the time that global CO2 emissions reach net zero per pathway class, and for 
all pathways classes combined. The top-right panel provides a schematic legend explaining all CO2 emissions contributions to global CO2 emissions. The bottom row shows how 
various CO2 contributions are deployed and used in the four illustrative pathway archetypes (LED, S1, S2, S5, referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for Policymakers) 
used in this chapter (see Section 2.3.1.1). Note that the S5 scenario reports the building and industry sector emissions jointly. Green-blue areas hence show emissions from the 
transport sector and the joint building and industry demand sector, respectively.

implemented, imply a total of 400–560 GtCO2 emissions over the 
2018–2030 period (considering both conditional and unconditional 
NDCs) (Rogelj et al., 2016a). Thus, following an NDC trajectory would 
already exhaust 95–130% (70–95%) of the remaining two-in-three 
(one-in-two) 1.5°C carbon budget (unadjusted for additional Earth 
system feedbacks) by 2030. This would leave no time (0–9 years) to 
bring down global emissions from NDC levels of around 40 GtCO2 yr−1 
in 2030 (Fawcett et al., 2015; Rogelj et al., 2016a) to net zero (further 
discussion in Section 2.3.5).
Most 1.5°C-consistent pathways show more stringent emissions 
reductions by 2030 than implied by the NDCs (Section 2.3.5) The lower 
end of those pathways reach down to below 20 GtCO2 yr−1 in 2030 
(Section 2.3.3, Table 2.4), less than half of what is implied by the NDCs. 
Whether such pathways will be able to limit warming to 1.5°C without 
overshoot will depend on whether cumulative net CO2 emissions over 
the 21st century can be kept below the remaining carbon budget at 
any time. Net global CO2 emissions are derived from the gross amount 
of CO2 that humans annually emit into the atmosphere reduced by the 
amount of anthropogenic CDR in each year. New research has looked 
more closely at the amount and the drivers of gross CO2 emissions 
from fossil-fuel combustion and industrial processes (FFI) in deep 
mitigation pathways (Luderer et al., 2018), and found that the larger 
part of remaining CO2 emissions come from direct fossil-fuel use in 
the transport and industry sectors, while residual energy supply sector 
emissions (mostly from the power sector) are limited by a rapid approach 
to net zero CO2 emissions until mid-century. The 1.5°C pathways with 
no or limited (<0.1°C) overshoot that were reported in the scenario 
database project remaining FFI CO2 emissions of 610–1260 GtCO2 over 
the period 2018–2100 (5th–95th percentile range; median: 880 GtCO2). 
Kriegler et al. (2018b) conducted a sensitivity analysis that explores the 
four central options for reducing fossil-fuel emissions: lowering energy 
demand, electrifying energy services, decarbonizing the power sector 
and decarbonizing non-electric fuel use in energy end-use sectors. By 
exploring these options to their extremes, they found a lowest value 
of 500 GtCO2 (2018–2100) gross fossil-fuel CO2 emissions for the 
hypothetical case of aligning the strongest assumptions for all four 
mitigation options. The two lines of evidence and the fact that available 
1.5°C pathways cover a wide range of assumptions (Section 2.3.1) 
give a robust indication of a lower limit of about 500 GtCO2 remaining 
fossil-fuel and industry CO2 emissions in the 21st century.
To compare these numbers with the remaining carbon budget, CO2 
emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) need 
to be taken into account. In many of the 1.5°C-consistent pathways, 
AFOLU CO2 emissions reach zero at or before mid-century and then 
turn to negative values (Table 2.4). This means human changes to the 
land lead to atmospheric carbon being stored in plants and soils. This 
needs to be distinguished from the natural CO2 uptake by land, which is 
not accounted for in the anthropogenic AFOLU CO2 emissions reported 
in the pathways. Given the difference in estimating the ‘anthropogenic’ 
sink between countries and the global integrated assessment and 
carbon modelling community (Grassi et al., 2017), the AFOLU CO2 
estimates included here are not necessarily directly comparable with 
countries’ estimates at global level. The cumulated amount of AFOLU 
CO2 emissions until the time they reach zero combine with the fossil-fuel 
and industry CO2 emissions to give a total amount of gross emissions 
of 650–1270 GtCO2 for the period 2018–2100 (5th–95th percentile; 
median 950 GtCO2) in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. 
The lower end of the range is close to what emerges from a scenario 
of transformative change that halves CO2 emissions every decade 
from 2020 to 2050 (Rockström et al., 2017). All these estimates are 
above the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting 
warming below 1.5°C without overshoot, including the low end of the 
hypothetical sensitivity analysis of Kriegler et al. (2018b), who assumes 
75 Gt AFOLU CO2 emissions adding to a total of 575 GtCO2 gross CO2 
emissions. As almost no cases have been identified that keep gross CO2 
emissions within the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance 
of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and based on current understanding of 
the geophysical response and its uncertainties, the available evidence 
indicates that avoiding overshoot of 1.5°C will require some type of 
CDR in a broad sense, e.g., via net negative AFOLU CO2 emissions 
(medium confidence). (Table 2.2).
Net CO2 emissions can fall below gross CO2 emissions, if CDR is 
brought into the mix. Studies have looked at mitigation and CDR 
in combination to identify strategies for limiting warming to 1.5°C 
(Sanderson et al., 2016; Ricke et al., 2017). CDR, which may include 
net negative AFOLU CO2 emissions, is deployed by all 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways available to this assessment, but the scale of deployment 
and choice of CDR measures varies widely (Section 2.3.4). Furthermore, 
no CDR technology has been deployed at scale yet, and all come with 
concerns about their potential (Fuss et al., 2018), feasibility (Nemet et 
al., 2018) and/or sustainability (Smith et al., 2015; Fuss et al., 2018) (see 
Sections 2.3.4, 4.3.2 and 4.3.7 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3 
for further discussion). CDR can have two very different functions in 
1.5°C-consistent pathways. If deployed in the first half of the century, 
before net zero CO2 emissions are reached, it neutralizes some of the 
remaining CO2 emissions year by year and thus slows the accumulation 
of CO2 in the atmosphere. In this first function it can be used to remain 
within the carbon budget and avoid overshoot. If CDR is deployed in the 
second half of the century after carbon neutrality has been established, 
it can still be used to neutralize some residual emissions from other 
sectors, but also to create net negative emissions that actively draw 
down the cumulative amount of CO2 emissions to return below a 
1.5°C warming level. In the second function, CDR enables temporary 
overshoot. The literature points to strong limitations to upscaling 
CDR (limiting its first abovementioned function) and to sustainability 
constraints (limiting both abovementioned functions) (Fuss et al., 
2018; Minx et al., 2018; Nemet et al., 2018). Large uncertainty hence 
exists about what amount of CDR could actually be available before 
mid-century. Kriegler et al. (2018b) explore a case limiting CDR to 
100 GtCO2 until 2050, and the 1.5°C pathways with no or limited 
overshoot available in the report’s database project 40–260 GtCO2 
CDR until the point of carbon neutrality (5th to 95th percentile; median 
110 GtCO2). Because gross CO2 emissions in most cases exceed the 
remaining carbon budget by several hundred GtCO2 and given the limits 
to CDR deployment until 2050, most of the 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
available to this assessment are overshoot pathways. However, the 
scenario database also contains nine non-overshoot pathways that 
remain below 1.5°C throughout the 21st century (Table 2.1).

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
2.3.3 
Emissions Evolution in 1.5°C Pathways
This section assesses the salient temporal evolutions of climate forcers 
over the 21st century. It uses the classification of 1.5°C pathways 
presented in Section 2.1, which includes a Below-1.5°C class, as well 
as other classes with varying levels of projected overshoot (1.5°C-low-
OS and 1.5°C-high-OS). First, aggregate-GHG benchmarks for 2030 
are assessed. Subsequent sections assess long-lived climate forcers 
(LLCF) and short-lived climate forcers (SLCF) separately because they 
contribute in different ways to near-term, peak and long-term warming 
(Section 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1). 
Estimates of aggregated GHG emissions in line with specific policy 
choices are often compared to near-term benchmark values from 
mitigation pathways to explore their consistency with long-term 
climate goals (Clarke et al., 2014; UNEP, 2016, 2017; UNFCCC, 2016). 
Benchmark emissions or estimates of peak years derived from IAMs 
provide guidelines or milestones that are consistent with achieving a 
given temperature level. While they do not set mitigation requirements 
in a strict sense, exceeding these levels in a given year almost invariably 
increases the mitigation challenges afterwards by increasing the rates 
of change and increasing the reliance on speculative technologies, 
including the possibility that its implementation becomes unachievable 
(see Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1 for a discussion of feasibility 
concepts) (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Clarke et al., 2014; 
Fawcett et al., 2015; Riahi et al., 2015; Kriegler et al., 2018a). These 
trade-offs are particularly pronounced in 1.5°C pathways and are 
discussed in Section 2.3.5. This section assesses Kyoto-GHG emissions 
in 2030 expressed in CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions using 100-year 
global warming potentials.3   
Appropriate benchmark values of aggregated GHG emissions depend 
on a variety of factors. First and foremost, they are determined by the 
desired likelihood to keep warming below 1.5°C and the extent to which 
projected temporary overshoot is to be avoided (Sections 2.2, 2.3.2, 
and 2.3.5). For instance, median aggregated 2030 GHG emissions are 
about 10 GtCO2e yr−1 lower in 1.5°C-low-OS compared to 1.5°C-high-
OS pathways, with respective interquartile ranges of 26–31 and 36–49 
GtCO2e yr−1 (Table 2.4). These ranges correspond to about 25–30 and 
35–48 GtCO2e yr−1 in 2030, respectively, when aggregated with 100-
year Global Warming Potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment 
Report. The limited evidence available for pathways aiming to limit 
warming below 1.5°C without overshoot or with limited amounts of 
CDR (Grubler et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018b; van Vuuren et al., 2018) 
indicates that under these conditions consistent emissions in 2030 
would fall at the lower end and below the above mentioned ranges. 
Due to the small number of 1.5°C pathways with no overshoot in the 
report’s database (Table 2.4) and the potential for a downward bias in 
the selection of underlying scenario assumptions, the headline range 
for 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot is also assessed to 
be of the order of 25–30 GtCO2e yr−1. Ranges for the 1.5°C-low-OS 
and Lower-2°C classes only overlap outside their interquartile ranges, 
highlighting the more accelerated reductions in 1.5°C-consistent 
compared to 2°C-consistent pathways. 
Appropriate emissions benchmark values also depend on the 
acceptable or desired portfolio of mitigation measures, representing 
clearly identified trade-offs and choices (Sections 2.3.4, 2.4, and 2.5.3) 
(Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013a; Clarke et al., 2014; Krey et al., 
2014a; Strefler et al., 2018b). For example, lower 2030 GHG emissions 
correlate with a lower dependence on the future availability and 
desirability of CDR (Strefler et al., 2018b). On the other hand, pathways 
that assume or anticipate only limited deployment of CDR during 
the 21st century imply lower emissions benchmarks over the coming 
decades, which are achieved in models through further reducing 
CO2 emissions in the coming decades. The pathway archetypes 
used in the chapter illustrate this further (Figure 2.6). Under middle- 
of-the-road assumptions of technological and socioeconomic 
development, pathway S2 suggests emission benchmarks of 34, 12 
and −8 GtCO2e yr−1 in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. 
In contrast, a pathway that further limits overshoot and aims at 
eliminating the reliance on negative emissions technologies like 
BECCS as well as CCS (here labelled as the LED pathway) shows 
deeper emissions reductions in 2030 to limit the cumulative amount 
of CO2 until net zero global CO2 emissions (carbon neutrality). The LED 
pathway here suggests emission benchmarks of 25, 9 and 2 GtCO2e yr−1 
in the years 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. However, a pathway 
that allows and plans for the successful large-scale deployment of 
BECCS by and beyond 2050 (S5) shows a shift in the opposite direction. 
The variation within and between the abovementioned ranges of 
2030 GHG benchmarks hence depends strongly on societal choices 
and preferences related to the acceptability and availability of certain 
technologies. 
Overall these variations do not strongly affect estimates of the 
1.5°C-consistent timing of global peaking of GHG emissions. Both 
Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways show minimum–maximum 
ranges in 2030 that do not overlap with 2020 ranges, indicating the 
global GHG emissions peaked before 2030 in these pathways. Also, 
2020 and 2030 GHG emissions in 1.5°C-high-OS pathways only 
overlap outside their interquartile ranges. 
Kyoto-GHG emission reductions are achieved by reductions in CO2 
and non-CO2 GHGs. The AR5 identified two primary factors that 
influence the depth and timing of reductions in non-CO2 Kyoto-GHG 
emissions: (i) the abatement potential and costs of reducing the 
emissions of these gases and (ii) the strategies that allow making 
trade-offs between them (Clarke et al., 2014). Many studies indicate 
low-cost, near-term mitigation options in some sectors for non-CO2 
gases compared to supply-side measures for CO2 mitigation (Clarke et 
al., 2014). A large share of this potential is hence already exploited in 
mitigation pathways in line with 2°C. At the same time, by mid-century 
and beyond, estimates of further reductions of non-CO2 Kyoto-GHGs – 
in particular CH4 and N2O – are hampered by the absence of mitigation 
3 
In this chapter GWP-100 values from the IPCC Fourth Assessement Report are used because emissions of fluorinated gases in the integrated pathways have been reported 
in this metric to the database. At a global scale, switching between GWP-100 values of the Second, Fourth or Fifth IPCC Assessment Reports could result in variations in 
aggregated Kyoto-GHG emissions of about ±5% in 2030 (UNFCCC, 2016).

Chapter 2

options in the current generation of IAMs, which are hence not able 
to reduce residual emissions of sources linked to livestock production 
and fertilizer use (Clarke et al., 2014; Gernaat et al., 2015) (Sections 
2.3.1.2, 2.4.4, Supplementary Material  2.SM.1.2). Therefore, while net 
CO2 emissions are projected to be markedly lower in 1.5°C-consistent 
compared to 2°C-consistent pathways, this is much less the case for 
methane (CH4) and nitrous-oxide (N2O) (Figures 2.6–2.7). This results 
in reductions of CO2 being projected to take up the largest share of 
emissions reductions when moving between 1.5°C-consistent and 
2°C-consistent pathways (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; Luderer et al., 
2018). If additional non-CO2 mitigation measures are identified and 
adequately included in IAMs, they are expected to further contribute to 
mitigation efforts by lowering the floor of residual non-CO2 emissions. 
However, the magnitude of these potential contributions has not been 
assessed as part of this report. 
As a result of the interplay between residual CO2 and non-CO2 emissions 
and CDR, global GHG emissions reach net zero levels at different times 
in different 1.5°C-consistent pathways. Interquartile ranges of the 
years in which 1.5°C-low-OS and 1.5°C-high-OS reach net zero GHG 
emissions range from 2060 to 2080 (Table 2.4). A seesaw characteristic 
can be found between near-term emissions reductions and the timing 
of net zero GHG emissions. This is because pathways with limited 
emissions reductions in the next one to two decades require net 
negative CO2 emissions later on (see earlier). Most 1.5°C-high-OS 
pathways lead to net zero GHG emissions in approximately the third 
quarter of this century, because all of them rely on significant amounts 
of annual net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the 
century to decline temperatures after overshoot (Table 2.4). However, 
in pathways that aim at limiting overshoot as much as possible or 
more slowly decline temperatures after their peak, emissions reach 
the point of net zero GHG emissions slightly later or at times never. 
Early emissions reductions in this case reduce the requirement for net 
negative CO2 emissions. Estimates of 2030 GHG emissions in line with 
the current NDCs overlap with the highest quartile of 1.5°C-high-OS 
pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4).
2.3.3.1 Emissions of long-lived climate forcers
Climate effects of long-lived climate forcers (LLCFs) are dominated by 
CO2, with smaller contributions of N2O and some fluorinated gases 
(Myhre et al., 2013; Blanco et al., 2014). Overall net CO2 emissions 
in pathways are the result of a combination of various anthropogenic 
contributions (Figure 2.5) (Clarke et al., 2014): (i) CO2 produced by fossil-
fuel combustion and industrial processes, (ii) CO2 emissions or removals 
from the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector, (iii) 
CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) from fossil fuels or industrial 
activities before it is released to the atmosphere, (iv) CO2 removal by 
technological means, which in current pathways is mainly achieved 
by BECCS and AFOLU-related CDR, although other options could 
be conceivable (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7). Pathways apply these 
four contributions in different configurations (Figure 2.5) depending 
on societal choices and preferences related to the acceptability and 
availability of certain technologies, the timing and stringency of near-
term climate policy, and the ability to limit the demand that drives 
baseline emissions (Marangoni et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Grubler 
et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018), and come with 
very different implication for sustainable development (Section 2.5.3). 
All 1.5°C pathways see global CO2 emissions embark on a steady 
decline to reach (near) net zero levels around 2050, with 1.5°C-low-
OS pathways reaching net zero CO2 emissions around 2045–2055 
(Table 2.4; Figure 2.5). Near-term differences between the various 
pathway classes are apparent, however. For instance, Below-1.5°C and 
1.5°C-low-OS pathways show a clear shift towards lower CO2 emissions 
in 2030 relative to other 1.5°C and 2°C pathway classes, although in all 
1.5°C classes reductions are clear (Figure 2.6). These lower near-term 
emissions levels are a direct consequence of the former two pathway 
classes limiting cumulative CO2 emissions until carbon neutrality in 
order to aim for a higher probability of limiting peak warming to 1.5°C 
(Section 2.2.2 and 2.3.2.2). In some cases, 1.5°C-low-OS pathways 
achieve net zero CO2 emissions one or two decades later, contingent on 
2030 CO2 emissions in the lower quartile of the literature range, that 
is, below about 18 GtCO2 yr−1. Median year-2030 global CO2 emissions 
are of the order of 5–10 GtCO2 yr−1 lower in Below-1.5°C compared 
to 1.5°C-low-OS pathways, which are in turn lower than 1.5°C-high-
OS pathways (Table 2.4). Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways 
combined show a decline in global net anthropogenic CO2 emissions 
of about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40–60% interquartile range). 
Lower-2°C pathways show CO2 emissions declining by about 25% by 
2030 in most pathways (10–30% interquartile range). The 1.5°C-high-
OS pathways show emissions levels that are broadly similar to the 
2°C-consistent pathways in 2030.
The development of CO2 emissions in the second half of the century in 
1.5°C pathways is characterized by the need to stay or return within 
a carbon budget. Figure 2.6 shows net CO2 and N2O emissions from 
various sources in 2050 and 2100 in 1.5°C pathways in the literature. 
Virtually all 1.5°C pathways obtain net negative CO2 emissions at some 
point during the 21st century, but the extent to which net negative 
emissions are relied upon varies substantially (Figure 2.6, Table 2.4). 
This net withdrawal of CO2 from the atmosphere compensates for 
residual long-lived non-CO2 GHG emissions that also accumulate in 
the atmosphere (like N2O) or cancels some of the build-up of CO2 due 
to earlier emissions to achieve increasingly higher likelihoods that 
warming stays or returns below 1.5°C (see Section 2.3.4 for a discussion 
of various uses of CDR). Even non-overshoot pathways that aim at 
achieving temperature stabilization would hence deploy a certain 
amount of net negative CO2 emissions to offset any accumulating 
long-lived non-CO2 GHGs. The 1.5°C overshoot pathways display 
significantly larger amounts of annual net negative CO2 emissions in 
the second half of the century. The larger the overshoot the more net 
negative CO2 emissions are required to return temperatures to 1.5°C 
by the end of the century (Table 2.4, Figure 2.1). 
N2O emissions decline to a much lesser extent than CO2 in currently 
available 1.5°C pathways (Figure 2.6). Current IAMs have limited 
emissions-reduction potentials (Gernaat et al., 2015) (Sections 2.3.1.2, 
2.4.4, Supplementary Material  2.SM.1.2), reflecting the difficulty of 
eliminating N2O emission from agriculture (Bodirsky et al., 2014). 
Moreover, the reliance of some pathways on significant amounts of 
bioenergy after mid-century (Section 2.4.2) coupled to a substantial 
use of nitrogen fertilizer (Popp et al., 2017) also makes reducing N2O 
emissions harder (for example, see pathway S5 in Figure 2.6). As

(c) CO2 emissions from the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector, (d) global N2O emissions, and (e) CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes. 
The latter is also split into (f) emissions from the energy supply sector (electricity sector and refineries) and (g) direct emissions from fossil-fuel use in energy demand sectors 
(industry, buildings, transport) (bottom row). Horizontal black lines show the median, boxes show the interquartile range, and whiskers the minimum–maximum range. Icons 
indicate the four pathway archetypes used in this chapter. In case less than seven data points are available in a class, the minimum–maximum range and single data points 
are shown. Kyoto-GHG, emissions in the top panel are aggregated with AR4 GWP-100 and contain CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6. NF3 is typically not reported by IAMs. 
Scenarios with year-2010 Kyoto-GHG emissions outside the range assessed by IPCC AR5 WGIII assessed are excluded (IPCC, 2014b).

a result, sizeable residual N2O emissions are currently projected to 
continue throughout the century, and measures to effectively mitigate 
them will be of continued relevance for 1.5°C societies. Finally, the 
reduction of nitrogen use and N2O emissions from agriculture is already 
a present-day concern due to unsustainable levels of nitrogen pollution 
(Bodirsky et al., 2012). Section 2.4.4 provides a further assessment of 
the agricultural non-CO2 emissions reduction potential. 
2.3.3.2 Emissions of short-lived climate forcers and 
fluorinated gases
SLCFs include shorter-lived GHGs like CH4 and some fluorinated gases 
as well as particles (aerosols), their precursors and ozone precursors. 
SLCFs are strongly mitigated in 1.5°C pathways, as is the case for 
2°C pathways (Figure 2.7). SLCF emissions ranges of 1.5°C and 2°C 
pathway classes strongly overlap, indicating that the main incremental 
mitigation contribution between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways comes from 
CO2 (Luderer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). CO2 and SLCF emissions 
reductions are connected in situations where SLCF and CO2 are 
co-emitted by the same process, for example, with coal-fired power 
plants (Shindell and Faluvegi, 2010) or within the transport sector 
(Fuglestvedt et al., 2010). Many CO2-targeted mitigation measures 
in industry, transport and agriculture (Sections 2.4.3–4) hence also 
reduce non-CO2 forcing (Rogelj et al., 2014b; Shindell et al., 2016).   
Despite the fact that methane has a strong warming effect (Myhre 
et al., 2013; Etminan et al., 2016), current 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
still project significant emissions of CH4 by 2050, indicating only a 
limited CH4 mitigation potential in IAM analyses (Gernaat et al., 2015) 
(Sections 2.3.1.2, 2.4.4, Table 2.SM.2). The AFOLU sector contributes an 
important share of the residual CH4 emissions until mid-century, with 
its relative share increasing from slightly below 50% in 2010 to around 
55–70% in 2030, and 60–80% in 2050 in 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
(interquartile range across 1.5°C-consistent pathways for projections). 
Many of the proposed measures to target CH4 (Shindell et al., 2012; 
Stohl et al., 2015) are included in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Figure 
2.7), though not all (Sections 2.3.1.2, 2.4.4, Table 2.SM.2). A detailed 
assessment of measures to further reduce AFOLU CH4 emissions has 
not been conducted.
Overall reductions of SLCFs can have effects of either sign on 
temperature depending on the balance between cooling and warming 
agents. The reduction in SO2 emissions is the dominant single effect as 
it weakens the negative total aerosol forcing. This means that reducing 
all SLCF emissions to zero would result in a short-term warming, 
although this warming is unlikely to be more than 0.5°C (Section 2.2 
and Figure 1.5 (Samset et al., 2018)). Because of this effect, suggestions 
have been proposed that target the warming agents only (referred to 
as short-lived climate pollutants or SLCPs instead of the more general 
short-lived climate forcers; e.g., Shindell et al., 2012), though aerosols 
are often emitted in varying mixtures of warming and cooling species 
(Bond et al., 2013). Black carbon (BC) emissions reach similar levels 
across 1.5°C-consistent and 2°C-consistent pathways available in the 
literature, with interquartile ranges of emissions reductions across 
pathways of 16–34% and 48–58% in 2030 and 2050, respectively, 
relative to 2010 (Figure 2.7). Recent studies have identified further 
reduction potentials for the near term, with global reductions of about 
80% being suggested (Stohl et al., 2015; Klimont et al., 2017). Because 
the dominant sources of certain aerosol mixtures are emitted during 
the combustion of fossil fuels, the rapid phase-out of unabated fossil 
fuels to avoid CO2 emissions would also result in removal of these 
either warming or cooling SLCF air-pollutant species. Furthermore, 
SLCFs are also reduced by efforts to reduce particulate air pollution. 
For example, year-2050 SO2 emissions (precursors of sulphate aerosol) 
in 1.5°C-consistent pathways are about 75–85% lower than their 2010 
levels. Some caveats apply, for example, if residential biomass use 
would be encouraged in industrialised countries in stringent mitigation 
pathways without appropriate pollution control measures, aerosol 
concentrations could also increase (Sand et al., 2015; Stohl et al., 2015).
Emissions of fluorinated gases (IPCC/TEAP, 2005; US EPA, 2013; Velders 
et al., 2015; Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson, 2017) in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways are reduced by roughly 75–80% relative to 2010 levels 
(interquartile range across 1.5°C-consistent pathways) in 2050, 
with no clear differences between the classes. Although unabated 
hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions have been projected to increase 
(Velders et al., 2015), the Kigali Amendment recently added HFCs to 
the basket of gases controlled under the Montreal Protocol (Höglund-
Isaksson et al., 2017). As part of the larger group of fluorinated 
gases, HFCs are also assumed to decline in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways. Projected reductions by 2050 of fluorinated gases under 
1.5°C-consistent pathways are deeper than published estimates of 
what a full implementation of the Montreal Protocol including its 
Kigali Amendment would achieve (Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2017), 
which project roughly a halving of fluorinated gas emissions in 2050 
compared to 2010. Assuming the application of technologies that 
are currently commercially available and at least to a limited extent 
already tested and implemented, potential fluorinated gas emissions 
reductions of more than 90% have been estimated (Höglund-Isaksson 
et al., 2017).
There is a general agreement across 1.5°C-consistent pathways that 
until 2030 forcing from the warming SLCFs is reduced less strongly 
than the net cooling forcing from aerosol effects, compared to 2010. 
As a result, the net forcing contributions from all SLCFs combined are 
projected to increase slightly by about 0.2–0.3 W m−2, compared to 
2010. Also, by the end of the century, about 0.1–0.3 W m−2 of SLCF 
forcing is generally currently projected to remain in 1.5°C-consistent 
scenarios (Figure 2.8). This is similar to developments in 2°C-consistent 
pathways (Rose et al., 2014b; Riahi et al., 2017), which show median 
forcing contributions from these forcing agents that are generally no 
more than 0.1 W m−2 higher. Nevertheless, there can be additional gains 
from targeted deeper reductions of CH4 emissions and tropospheric 
ozone precursors, with some scenarios projecting less than 0.1 W m−2 
forcing from SLCFs by 2100.
2.3.4 
CDR in 1.5°C Pathways 
Deep mitigation pathways assessed in AR5 showed significant 
deployment of CDR, in particular through BECCS (Clarke et al., 2014). 
This has led to increased debate about the necessity, feasibility and 
desirability of large-scale CDR deployment, sometimes also called 
‘negative emissions technologies’ in the literature (Fuss et al., 2014; 
Anderson and Peters, 2016; Williamson, 2016; van Vuuren et al.,

reduction numbers included in headline statement C.1 in the Summary for Policymakers are computed relative to 2010 emissions in each individual pathway, and  
 
hence differ slightly from a case where reductions are computed relative to the historical 2010 emissions reported above. A difference is reported in estimating the  
 
‘anthropogenic’ sink by countries or the global carbon modelling community (Grassi et al., 2017), and AFOLU CO2 estimates reported here are thus not necessarily  
 
comparable with countries’ estimates. Scenarios with year-2010 Kyoto-GHG emissions outside the range assessed by IPCC AR5 WGIII are excluded (IPCC, 2014b),  
 
as are scenario duplicates that would bias ranges towards a single study.

2017a; Obersteiner et al., 2018). Most CDR technologies remain largely 
unproven to date and raise substantial concerns about adverse side-
effects on environmental and social sustainability (Smith et al., 2015; 
Dooley and Kartha, 2018). A set of key questions emerge: how strongly 
do 1.5°C-consistent pathways rely on CDR deployment and what types 
of CDR measures are deployed at which scale? How does this vary 
across available 1.5°C-consistent pathways and on which factors does 
it depend? How does CDR deployment compare between 1.5°C- and 
2°C-consistent pathways and how does it compare with the findings 
at the time of the AR5? How does CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways relate to questions about availability, policy implementation 
and sustainable development implications that have been raised 
about CDR technologies? The first three questions are assessed in this 
section with the goal to provide an overview and assessment of CDR 
deployment in the 1.5°C pathway literature. The fourth question is only 
touched upon here and is addressed in greater depth in Chapter 4, 
Section 4.3.7, which assesses the rapidly growing literature on costs, 
potentials, availability and sustainability implications of individual 
CDR measures (Minx et al., 2017, 2018; Fuss et al., 2018; Nemet 
et al., 2018). In addition, Section 2.3.5 assesses the relationship 
between delayed mitigation action and increased CDR reliance. CDR 
deployment is intricately linked to the land-use transformation in 
1.5°C-consistent pathways. This transformation is assessed in Section 
2.4.4. Bioenergy and BECCS impacts on sustainable land management 
are further assessed in Chapter 3, Section 3.6.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 
7 in Chapter 3. Ultimately, a comprehensive assessment of the land 
implication of land-based CDR measures will be provided in the IPCC 
AR6 Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL). 
2.3.4.1 CDR technologies and deployment levels in 1.5°C 
pathways
A number of approaches to actively remove carbon-dioxide from 
the atmosphere are increasingly discussed in the literature (Minx 
et al., 2018) (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7). Approaches under 
consideration include the enhancement of terrestrial and coastal 
carbon storage in plants and soils such as afforestation and 
reforestation (Canadell and Raupach, 2008), soil carbon enhancement 
(Paustian et al., 2016; Frank et al., 2017; Zomer et al., 2017), and other 
conservation, restoration, and management options for natural and 
managed land (Griscom et al., 2017) and coastal ecosystems (McLeod 
et al., 2011). Biochar sequestration (Woolf et al., 2010; Smith, 2016; 
Werner et al., 2018) provides an additional route for terrestrial carbon 
storage. Other approaches are concerned with storing atmospheric 
carbon dioxide in geological formations. They include the combination 
of biomass use for energy production with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS) (Obersteiner et al., 2001; Keith and Rhodes, 2002; Gough 
and Upham, 2011) and direct air capture with storage (DACCS) using 
chemical solvents and sorbents (Zeman and Lackner, 2004; Keith et 
al., 2006; Socolow et al., 2011). Further approaches investigate the 
mineralization of atmospheric carbon dioxide (Mazzotti et al., 2005; 
Matter et al., 2016), including enhanced weathering of rocks (Schuiling 
and Krijgsman, 2006; Hartmann et al., 2013; Strefler et al., 2018a). 
A fourth group of approaches is concerned with the sequestration 
of carbon dioxide in the oceans, for example by means of ocean 
alkalinization (Kheshgi, 1995; Rau, 2011; Ilyina et al., 2013; Lenton et 
al., 2018). The costs, CDR potential and environmental side effects of 
several of these measures are increasingly investigated and compared 
in the literature, but large uncertainties remain, in particular concerning 
the feasibility and impact of large-scale deployment of CDR measures 
(The Royal Society, 2009; Smith et al., 2015; Psarras et al., 2017; Fuss 
et al., 2018) (see Chapter 4.3.7). There are also proposals to remove 
methane, nitrous oxide and halocarbons via photocatalysis from the 
atmosphere (Boucher and Folberth, 2010; de Richter et al., 2017), but 
a broader assessment of their effectiveness, cost and sustainability 
impacts is lacking to date. 
Only some of these approaches have so far been considered in IAMs 
(see Section 2.3.1.2). The mitigation scenario literature up to AR5 
mostly included BECCS and, to a more limited extent, afforestation 
and reforestation (Clarke et al., 2014). Since then, some 2°C- and 
1.5°C-consistent pathways including additional CDR measures such 
as DACCS (Chen and Tavoni, 2013; Marcucci et al., 2017; Lehtilä and 
Koljonen, 2018; Strefler et al., 2018b) and soil carbon sequestration 
(Frank et al., 2017) have become available. Other, more speculative 
approaches, in particular ocean-based CDR and removal of non-CO2 
gases, have not yet been taken up by the literature on mitigation 
pathways. See Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2 for an overview on 
the coverage of CDR measures in models which contributed pathways 
to this assessment. Chapter 4.3.7 assesses the potential, costs, and 
sustainability implications of the full range of CDR measures.
Integrated assessment modelling has not yet explored land conservation, 
restoration and management options to remove carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere in sufficient depth, despite land management having a 
potentially considerable impact on the terrestrial carbon stock (Erb et 
al., 2018). Moreover, associated CDR measures have low technological 
requirements, and come with potential environmental and social 
co-benefits (Griscom et al., 2017). Despite the evolving capabilities of 
IAMs in accounting for a wider range of CDR measures, 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways assessed here continue to predominantly rely on BECCS and 
afforestation/reforestation (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2). 
However, IAMs with spatially explicit land-use modelling include a full 
accounting of land-use change emissions comprising carbon stored 
in the terrestrial biosphere and soils. Net CDR in the AFOLU sector, 
including but not restricted to afforestation and reforestation, can thus 
in principle be inferred by comparing AFOLU CO2 emissions between 
a baseline scenario and a 1.5°C-consistent pathway from the same 
model and study. However, baseline AFOLU CO2 emissions can not only 
be reduced by CDR in the AFOLU sector but also by measures to reduce 
deforestation and preserve land carbon stocks. The pathway literature 
and pathway data available to this assessment do not yet allow 
separating the two contributions. As a conservative approximation, the 
additional net negative AFOLU CO2 emissions below the baseline are 
taken as a proxy for AFOLU CDR in this assessment. Because this does 
not include CDR that was deployed before reaching net zero AFOLU 
CO2 emissions, this approximation is a lower-bound for terrestrial CDR 
in the AFOLU sector (including all mitigation-policy-related factors that 
lead to net negative AFOLU CO2 emissions).
The scale and type of CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent pathways 
varies widely (Figure 2.9 and 2.10). Overall CDR deployment over the 
21st century is substantial in most of the pathways, and deployment 
levels cover a wide range, on the order of 100–1000 Gt CO2 in 1.5°C 
122

pathways with no or limited overshoot (730 [260–1030] GtCO2, for 
median and 5th–95th percentile range). Both BECCS (480 [0–1000] 
GtCO2 in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot) and AFOLU 
CDR measures including afforestation and reforestation (210 [10-
540] GtCO2 in 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot) can play 
a major role,4 but for both cases pathways exist where they play no 
role at all. This shows the flexibility in substituting between individual 
CDR measures, once a portfolio of options becomes available. The high 
end of the CDR deployment range is populated by high overshoot 
pathways, as illustrated by pathway archetype S5 based on SSP5 
(fossil-fuelled development, see Section 2.3.1.1) and characterized 
by very large BECCS deployment to return warming to 1.5°C by 2100 
(Kriegler et al., 2017). In contrast, the low end is populated by a few 
pathways with no or limited overshoot that limit CDR to on the order of 
100–200 GtCO2 over the 21st century, coming entirely from terrestrial 
CDR measures with no or small use of BECCS. These are pathways 
with very low energy demand facilitating the rapid phase-out of 
fossil fuels and process emissions that exclude BECCS and CCS use 
(Grubler et al., 2018) and/or pathways with rapid shifts to sustainable 
food consumption freeing up sufficient land areas for afforestation 
and reforestation (Haberl et al., 2011; van Vuuren et al., 2018). Some 
pathways use neither BECCS nor afforestation but still rely on CDR 
through considerable net negative CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector 
around mid-century (Holz et al., 2018b). We conclude that the role of 
BECCS as a dominant CDR measure in deep mitigation pathways has 
been reduced since the time of the AR5. This is related to three factors: 
a larger variation of underlying assumptions about socio-economic 
drivers (Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018) and associated energy 
(Grubler et al., 2018) and food demand (van Vuuren et al., 2018); 
the incorporation of a larger portfolio of mitigation and CDR options 
(Marcucci et al., 2017; Grubler et al., 2018; Lehtilä and Koljonen, 
2018; Liu et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018); and targeted analysis 
of deployment limits for (specific) CDR measures (Holz et al., 2018b; 
Kriegler et al., 2018a; Strefler et al., 2018b), including the availability 
of bioenergy (Bauer et al., 2018), CCS (Krey et al., 2014a; Grubler et 
al., 2018) and afforestation (Popp et al., 2014b, 2017). As additional 
CDR measures are being built into IAMs, the prevalence of BECCS is 
expected to be further reduced.
Figure 2.9 |  Cumulative CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent pathways in the literature as reported in the database collected for this assessment until 
2050 (panel a) and until 2100 (panel b). Total CDR comprises all forms of CDR, including AFOLU CDR and BECCS, and, in a few pathways, other CDR measures like DACCS. 
It does not include CCS combined with fossil fuels (which is not a CDR technology as it does not result in active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere). AFOLU CDR has not been 
reported directly and is hence represented by means of a proxy: the additional amount of net negative CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector compared to a baseline scenario (see 
text for a discussion). ‘Compensatory CO2’ depicts the cumulative amount of CDR that is used to neutralize concurrent residual CO2 emissions. ‘Net negative CO2’ describes the 
additional amount of CDR that is used to produce net negative CO2 emissions, once residual CO2 emissions are neutralized. The two quantities add up to total CDR for individual 
pathways (not for percentiles and medians, see Footnote 4).
4 
The median and percentiles of the sum of two quantities is in general not equal to the sum of the medians and percentiles, respectively, of the two quantitites.  
As discussed in Section 2.3.2, CDR can be used in two ways in 
mitigation pathways: (i) to move more rapidly towards the point of 
carbon neutrality and maintain it afterwards in order to stabilize global 
mean temperature rise, and (ii) to produce net negative CO2 emissions, 
drawing down anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere in order to decline 
global mean temperature after an overshoot peak (Kriegler et al., 2018b; 
Obersteiner et al., 2018). Both uses are important in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways (Figure 2.9 and 2.10). Because of the tighter remaining 1.5°C 
carbon budget, and because many pathways in the literature do not 
restrict exceeding this budget prior to 2100, the relative weight of 
the net negative emissions component of CDR increases compared to 
2°C-consistent pathways. The amount of compensatory CDR remains 
roughly the same over the century. This is the net effect of stronger 
deployment of compensatory CDR until mid-century to accelerate 
the approach to carbon neutrality and less compensatory CDR in the 
second half of the century due to deeper mitigation of end-use sectors

Figure 2.10 |  Accounting of cumulative CO2 emissions for the four 1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes. See top panel for explanation of the bar plots. Total 
CDR is the difference between gross (red horizontal bar) and net (purple horizontal bar) cumulative CO2 emissions over the period 2018–2100, and it is equal to the sum of the 
BECCS (grey) and AFOLU CDR (green) contributions. Cumulative net negative emissions are the difference between peak (orange horizontal bar) and net (purple) cumulative CO2 
emissions. The blue shaded area depicts the estimated range of the remaining carbon budget for a two-in-three to one-in-two chance of staying below1.5°C. The grey shaded 
area depicts the range when accounting for additional Earth system feedbacks.  
in 1.5°C-consistent pathways (Luderer et al., 2018). Comparing median 
levels, end-of-century net cumulative CO2 emissions are roughly 
600 GtCO2 smaller in 1.5°C compared to 2°C-consistent pathways, 
with approximately two thirds coming from further reductions of gross 
CO2 emissions and the remaining third from increased CDR deployment. 
As a result, median levels of total CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways are larger than in 2°C-consistent pathways (Figure 2.9), but 
with marked variations in each pathway class.
Ramp-up rates of individual CDR measures in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways are provided in Table 2.4. BECCS deployment is still 
limited in 2030, but ramps up to median levels of 3 (Below-1.5°C), 
5 (1.5°C-low-OS) and 7 GtCO2 yr−1 (1.5°C-high-OS) in 2050, and to 6 
(Below-1.5°C), 12 (1.5°C-low-OS) and 15 GtCO2 yr−1 (1.5°C-high-OS) 
in 2100, respectively. In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, 
this amounts to 0–1, 0–8, and 0–16 GtCO2 yr−1 in 2030, 2050, and 
2100, respectively (ranges refer to the union of the min-max range 
of the Below-1.5°C and the interquartile range of the 1.5°C-low-OS 
class; see Table 2.4). Net CDR in the AFOLU sector reaches slightly 
lower levels in 2050, and stays more constant until 2100. In 1.5°C 
pathways with no or limited overshoot, AFOLU CDR amounts to 0–5, 
1–11, and 1–5 GtCO2 yr−1 (see above for the definition of the ranges) 
in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. In contrast to BECCS, AFOLU 
CDR is more strongly deployed in non-overshoot than overshoot 
pathways. This indicates differences in the timing of the two CDR 
approaches. Afforestation is scaled up until around mid-century, when 
the time of carbon neutrality is reached in 1.5°C-consistent pathways, 
while BECCS is projected to be used predominantly in the 2nd half 
of the century (Figure 2.5). This reflects the fact that afforestation is 
a readily available CDR technology, while BECCS is more costly and 
much less mature a technology. As a result, the two options contribute 
differently to compensating concurrent CO2 emissions (until 2050) 
and to producing net negative CO2 emissions (post-2050). BECCS 
deployment is particularly strong in pathways with high overshoots 
but can also feature in pathways with low overshoot (see Figure 2.5 
and 2.10). Annual deployment levels until mid-century are not found 
to be significantly different between 2°C-consistent pathways and 
1.5°C-consistent pathways with no or low overshoot. This suggests 
similar implementation challenges for ramping up BECCS deployment 
at the rates projected in the pathways (Honegger and Reiner, 2018; 
Nemet et al., 2018). The feasibility and sustainability of upscaling CDR 
at these rates is assessed in Chapter 4.3.7.
124
Chapter 2 
Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development
2
Concerns have been raised that building expectations about large-
scale CDR deployment in the future can lead to an actual reduction 
of near-term mitigation efforts (Geden, 2015; Anderson and Peters, 
2016; Dooley and Kartha, 2018). The pathway literature confirms that 
CDR availability influences the shape of mitigation pathways critically 
(Krey et al., 2014a; Holz et al., 2018b; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Strefler 
et al., 2018b). Deeper near-term emissions reductions are required to 
reach the 1.5°C–2°C target range if CDR availability is constrained. As 
a result, the least-cost benchmark pathways to derive GHG emissions 
gap estimates (UNEP, 2017) are dependent on assumptions about CDR 
availability. Using GHG benchmarks in climate policy makes implicit 
assumptions about CDR availability (Fuss et al., 2014; van Vuuren 
et al., 2017a). At the same time, the literature also shows that rapid 
and stringent mitigation as well as large-scale CDR deployment occur 
simultaneously in 1.5°C pathways due to the tight remaining carbon 
budget (Luderer et al., 2018). Thus, an emissions gap is identified even 
for high CDR availability (Strefler et al., 2018b), contradicting a wait-
and-see approach. There are significant trade-offs between near-term 
action, overshoot and reliance on CDR deployment in the long-term 
which are assessed in Section 2.3.5.
Box 2.1 |  Bioenergy and BECCS Deployment in Integrated Assessment Modelling
Bioenergy can be used in various parts of the energy sector of IAMs, including for electricity, liquid fuel, biogas, and hydrogen production. 
It is this flexibility that makes bioenergy and bioenergy technologies valuable for the decarbonization of energy use (Klein et al., 2014; 
Krey et al., 2014a; Rose et al., 2014a; Bauer et al., 2017, 2018). Most bioenergy technologies in IAMs are also available in combination 
with CCS (BECCS). Assumed capture rates differ between technologies, for example, about 90% for electricity and hydrogen production 
and about 40–50% for liquid fuel production. Decisions about bioenergy deployment in IAMs are based on economic considerations to 
stay within a carbon budget that is consistent with a long-term climate goal. IAMs consider both the value of bioenergy in the energy 
system and the value of BECCS in removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Typically, if bioenergy is strongly limited, BECCS technologies 
with high capture rates are favoured. If bioenergy is plentiful IAMs tend to choose biofuel technologies with lower capture rates but 
high value for replacing fossil fuels in transport (Kriegler et al., 2013a; Bauer et al., 2018). Most bioenergy use in IAMs is combined with 
CCS if available (Rose et al., 2014a). If CCS is unavailable, bioenergy use remains largely unchanged or even increases due to the high 
value of bioenergy for the energy transformation (Bauer et al., 2018). As land impacts are tied to bioenergy use, the exclusion of BECCS 
from the mitigation portfolio will not automatically remove the trade-offs with food, water and other sustainability objectives due to 
the continued and potentially increased use of bioenergy.
IAMs assume bioenergy to be supplied mostly from second generation biomass feedstocks such as dedicated cellulosic crops (for 
example Miscanthus or poplar) as well as agricultural and forest residues. Detailed process IAMs include land-use models that capture 
competition for land for different uses (food, feed, fiber, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity protection) under a range of dynamic 
factors including socio-economic drivers, productivity increases in crop and livestock systems, food demand, and land, environmental, 
biodiversity, and carbon policies. Assumptions about these factors can vary widely between different scenarios (Calvin et al., 2014; 
Popp et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2018). IAMs capture a number of potential environmental impacts from bioenergy production, in 
particular indirect land-use change emissions from land conversion and nitrogen and water use for bioenergy production (Kraxner et al., 
2013; Bodirsky et al., 2014; Bonsch et al., 2014; Obersteiner et al., 2016; Humpenöder et al., 2018). The impact of bioenergy production 
on soil degradation is an area of active IAM development and was not comprehensively accounted for in the mitigation pathways 
assessed in this report (but is, for example, in Frank et al., 2017). Whether bioenergy has large adverse impacts on environmental and 
societal goals depends in large parts on the governance of land use (Haberl et al., 2013; Erb et al., 2016b; Obersteiner et al., 2016; 
Humpenöder et al., 2018). Here IAMs often make idealized assumptions about effective land management, such as full protection of 
the land carbon stock by conservation measures and a global carbon price, respectively, but variations on these assumptions have also 
been explored (Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014a).
2.3.4.2 Sustainability implications of CDR deployment in 1.5°C 
pathways
Strong concerns about the sustainability implications of large-scale 
CDR deployment in deep mitigation pathways have been raised in the 
literature (Williamson and Bodle, 2016; Boysen et al., 2017b; Dooley and 
Kartha, 2018; Heck et al., 2018), and a number of important knowledge 
gaps have been identified (Fuss et al., 2016). An assessment of the 
literature on implementation constraints and sustainable development 
implications of CDR measures is provided in Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 and 
the Cross-chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3. An initial discussion of potential 
environmental side effects of CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent 
pathways is provided in this section. Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 then 
contrasts CDR deployment in 1.5°C-consistent pathways with other 
branches of literature on limitations of CDR. Integrated modelling aims 
to explore a range of developments compatible with specific climate 
goals and often does not include the full set of broader environmental 
and societal concerns beyond climate change. This has given rise to 
the concept of sustainable development pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 
1 in Chapter 1) (van Vuuren et al., 2015), and there is an increasing 
body of work to extend integrated modelling to cover a broader range 
of sustainable development goals (Section 2.6). However, only some 
125
2
Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
of the available 1.5°C-consistent pathways were developed within a 
larger sustainable development context  (Bertram et al., 2018; Grubler 
et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). As discussed 
in Section 2.3.4.1, those pathways are characterized by low energy 
and/or food demand effectively limiting fossil-fuel substitution and 
alleviating land competition, respectively. They also include regulatory 
policies for deepening early action and ensuring environmental 
protection (Bertram et al., 2018). Overall sustainability implications of 
1.5°C-consistent pathways are assessed in Section 2.5.3 and Chapter 
5, Section 5.4.
Individual CDR measures have different characteristics and therefore 
would carry different risks for their sustainable deployment at scale 
(Smith et al., 2015). Terrestrial CDR measures, BECCS and enhanced 
weathering of rock powder distributed on agricultural lands require 
land. Those land-based measures could have substantial impacts 
on environmental services and ecosystems (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter 3) (Smith and Torn, 2013; Boysen et al., 2016; Heck et al., 2016; 
Krause et al., 2017). Measures like afforestation and bioenergy with 
and without CCS that directly compete with other land uses could have 
significant impacts on agricultural and food systems (Creutzig et al., 
2012, 2015; Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014b, 2017; Kreidenweis 
et al., 2016; Boysen et al., 2017a; Frank et al., 2017; Stevanović et al., 
2017; Strapasson et al., 2017; Humpenöder et al., 2018). BECCS using 
dedicated bioenergy crops could substantially increase agricultural 
water demand (Bonsch et al., 2014; Séférian et al., 2018) and nitrogen 
fertilizer use (Bodirsky et al., 2014). DACCS and BECCS rely on CCS and 
would require safe storage space in geological formations, including 
management of leakage risks (Pawar et al., 2015) and induced 
seismicity (Nicol et al., 2013). Some approaches like DACCS have high 
energy demand (Socolow et al., 2011). Most of the CDR measures 
currently discussed could have significant impacts on either land, 
energy, water, or nutrients if deployed at scale (Smith et al., 2015). 
However, actual trade-offs depend on a multitude factors (Haberl et 
al., 2011; Erb et al., 2012; Humpenöder et al., 2018), including the 
modalities of CDR deployment (e.g., on marginal vs. productive land) 
(Bauer et al., 2018), socio-economic developments (Popp et al., 2017), 
dietary choices (Stehfest et al., 2009; Popp et al., 2010; van Sluisveld et 
al., 2016; Weindl et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2018), yield increases, 
livestock productivity and other advances in agricultural technology 
(Havlik et al., 2013; Valin et al., 2013; Havlík et al., 2014; Weindl et al., 
2015; Erb et al., 2016b), land policies (Schmitz et al., 2012; Calvin et al., 
2014; Popp et al., 2014a), and governance of land use (Unruh, 2011; 
Buck, 2016; Honegger and Reiner, 2018).
Figure 2.11 shows the land requirements for BECCS and afforestation 
in the selected 1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes, including the LED 
(Grubler et al., 2018) and S1 pathways (Fujimori, 2017; Rogelj et al., 
2018) following a sustainable development paradigm. As discussed, 
these land-use patterns are heavily influenced by assumptions about, 
among other things, future population levels, crop yields, livestock 
production systems, and food and livestock demand, which all vary 
between the pathways (Popp et al., 2017) (Section 2.3.1.1). In pathways 
that allow for large-scale afforestation in addition to BECCS, land 
demand for afforestation can be larger than for BECCS (Humpenöder 
et al., 2014). This follows from the assumption in the modelled 
pathways that, unlike bioenergy crops, forests are not harvested to 
allow unabated carbon storage on the same patch of land. If wood 
harvest and subsequent processing or burial are taken into account, 
this finding can change. There are also synergies between the various 
uses of land, which are not reflected in the depicted pathways. Trees 
can grow on agricultural land (Zomer et al., 2016), and harvested 
wood can be used with BECCS and pyrolysis systems (Werner et al., 
2018). The pathways show a very substantial land demand for the two 
CDR measures combined, up to the magnitude of the current global 
cropland area. This is achieved in IAMs in particular by a conversion of 
pasture land freed by intensification of livestock production systems, 
pasture intensification and/or demand changes (Weindl et al., 2017), 
and to a more limited extent, cropland for food production, as well 
as expansion into natural land. However, pursuing such large-scale 
changes in land use would pose significant food supply, environmental 
and governance challenges, concerning both land management and 
tenure (Unruh, 2011; Erb et al., 2012, 2016b; Haberl et al., 2013; 
Haberl, 2015; Buck, 2016), particularly if synergies between land 
uses, the relevance of dietary changes for reducing land demand, and 
co-benefits with other sustainable development objectives are not 
fully recognized. A general discussion of the land-use transformation in 
1.5°C-consistent pathways is provided in Section 2.4.4. 
An important consideration for CDR which moves carbon from the 
atmosphere to the geological, oceanic or terrestrial carbon pools is the 
permanence of carbon stored in these different pools (Matthews and 
Caldeira, 2008; NRC, 2015; Fuss et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016) (see 
also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7 for a discussion). Terrestrial carbon can 
be returned to the atmosphere on decadal time scales by a variety of 
mechanisms, such as soil degradation, forest pest outbreaks and forest 
fires, and therefore requires careful consideration of policy frameworks 
to manage carbon storage, for example, in forests (Gren and Aklilu, 
2016). There are similar concerns about outgassing of CO2 from ocean 
storage (Herzog et al., 2003), unless it is transformed to a substance 
that does not easily exchange with the atmosphere, for example, ocean 
alkalinity or buried marine biomass (Rau, 2011). Understanding of the 
assessment and management of the potential risk of CO2 release from 
geological storage of CO2 has improved since the IPCC Special Report 
on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (IPCC, 2005) with experience 
and the development of management practices in geological storage 
projects, including risk management to prevent sustentative leakage 
(Pawar et al., 2015). Estimates of leakage risk have been updated to 
include scenarios of unregulated drilling and limited wellbore integrity 
(Choi et al., 2013) and find that about 70% of stored CO2 would still 
be retained after 10,000 years in these circumstances (Alcalde et al., 
2018). The literature on the potential environmental impacts from the 
leakage of CO2 – and approaches to minimize these impacts should 
a leak occur – has also grown and is reviewed by Jones et al. (2015). 
To the extent that non-permanence of terrestrial and geological carbon 
storage is driven by socio-economic and political factors, there are 
parallels to questions of fossil-fuel reservoirs remaining in the ground 
(Scott et al., 2015).

2.3.5 
Implications of Near-Term Action in 1.5°C Pathways 
Less CO2 emission reductions in the near term would require steeper 
and deeper reductions in the longer term in order to meet specific 
warming targets afterwards (Riahi et al., 2015; Luderer et al., 2016a). 
This is a direct consequence of the quasi-linear relationship between 
the total cumulative amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere and 
global mean temperature rise (Matthews et al., 2009; Zickfeld et al., 
2009; Collins et al., 2013; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015). Besides this clear 
geophysical trade-off over time, delaying GHG emissions reductions 
over the coming years also leads to economic and institutional lock-in 
into carbon-intensive infrastructure, that is, the continued investment 
in and use of carbon-intensive technologies that are difficult or costly 
to phase-out once deployed (Unruh and Carrillo-Hermosilla, 2006; 
Jakob et al., 2014; Erickson et al., 2015; Steckel et al., 2015; Seto et al., 
2016; Michaelowa et al., 2018). Studies show that to meet stringent 
climate targets despite near-term delays in emissions reductions, 
models prematurely retire carbon-intensive infrastructure, in particular 
coal without CCS (Bertram et al., 2015a; Johnson et al., 2015). The AR5 
reports that delaying mitigation action leads to substantially higher 
rates of emissions reductions afterwards, a larger reliance on CDR 
technologies in the long term, and higher transitional and long-term 
economic impacts (Clarke et al., 2014). The literature mainly focuses 
on delayed action until 2030 in the context of meeting a 2°C goal 
(den Elzen et al., 2010; van Vuuren and Riahi, 2011; Kriegler et al., 
2013b; Luderer et al., 2013, 2016a; Rogelj et al., 2013b; Riahi et al., 
2015; OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). However, because of the smaller 
carbon budget consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C and the 
absence of a clearly declining long-term trend in global emissions 
to date, these general insights apply equally, or even more so, to the 
more stringent mitigation context of 1.5°C-consistent pathways. This 
is further supported by estimates of committed emissions due to fossil 
fuel-based infrastructure (Seto et al., 2016; Edenhofer et al., 2018).
All available 1.5°C pathways that explore consistent mitigation action 
from 2020 onwards peak global Kyoto-GHG emissions in the next 
decade and already decline Kyoto-GHG emissions to below 2010 levels 
by 2030. The near-term emissions development in these pathways 
can be compared with estimated emissions in 2030 implied by the 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by Parties 
to the Paris Agreement (Figure 2.12). Altogether, the unconditional 
(conditional) NDCs are assessed to result in global Kyoto-GHG 
emissions on the order of 52–58 (50–54) GtCO2e yr−1 in 2030 (e.g., 
den Elzen et al., 2016; Fujimori et al., 2016; UNFCCC, 2016; Rogelj et 
al., 2017; Rose et al., 2017b; Benveniste et al., 2018; Vrontisi et al., 
2018; see Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4 for detailed assessment). 
In contrast, 1.5°C pathways with limited overshoot available to this 
assessment show an interquartile range of about 26–31 (median 28) 
GtCO2e yr−1 in 20305 (Table 2.4, Section 2.3.3). Based on these ranges, 
this report assesses the emissions gap for a two-in-three chance of 
limiting warming to 1.5°C to be 26 (19–29) and 28 (22–33) GtCO2e 
(median and interquartile ranges) for conditional and unconditional 
NDCs, respectively (Cross-Chapter Box 11, applying GWP-100 values 
from the IPCC Second Assessment Report).
The later emissions peak and decline, the more CO2 will have 
accumulated in the atmosphere. Peak cumulated CO2 emissions – 
and consequently peak temperatures – increase with higher 2030 
emissions levels (Figure 2.12). Current NDCs (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in 
Chapter 4) are estimated to lead to CO2 emissions of about 400–560 
GtCO2 from 2018 to 2030 (Rogelj et al., 2016a). Available 1.5°C- and 
2°C-consistent pathways with 2030 emissions in the range estimated 
Figure 2.11 |  Land-use changes in 2050 and 2100 in the illustrative 1.5°C-consistent pathway archetypes (Fricko et al., 2017; Fujimori, 2017; Kriegler et 
al., 2017; Grubler et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). Changes in land for food crops, energy crops, forest, pasture and other natural land are shown, compared to 2010.

Note that aggregated Kyoto-GHG emissions implied by the NDCs from Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4 and Kyoto-GHG ranges from the pathway classes in Chapter 2 
are only approximately comparable, because this chapter applies GWP-100 values from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report while the NDC Cross-Chapter Box 11 applies 
GWP-100 values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report. At a global scale, switching between GWP-100 values of the Second to the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report 
would result in an increase in estimated aggregated Kyoto-GHG emissions of no more than about 3% in 2030 (UNFCCC, 2016).

Kyoto gas emissions in 2030 (GtCO2 eq yr-�)
for the NDCs rely on an assumed swift and widespread deployment of 
CDR after 2030, and show peak cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 
of about 800–1000 GtCO2, above the remaining carbon budget for a 
one-in-two chance of remaining below 1.5°C. These emissions reflect 
that no pathway is able to project a phase-out of CO2 emissions starting 
from year-2030 NDC levels of about 40 GtCO2 yr−1 (Fawcett et al., 2015; 
Rogelj et al., 2016a) to net zero in less than about 15 years. Based on 
the implied emissions until 2030, the high challenges of the assumed 
post-2030 transition, and the assessment of carbon budgets in Section 
2.2.2, global warming is assessed to exceed 1.5°C if emissions stay at 
the levels implied by the NDCs until 2030 (Figure 2.12). The chances 
of remaining below 1.5°C in these circumstances remain conditional 
upon geophysical properties that are uncertain, but these Earth 
system response uncertainties would have to serendipitously align 
beyond current median estimates in order for current NDCs to become 
consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.  
Figure 2.12 |  Median global warming estimated by MAGICC (panel a) and peak cumulative CO2 emissions (panel b) in 1.5°C-consistent pathways in the 
SR1.5 scenario database, as a function of CO2-equivalent emissions (based on AR4 GWP-100) of Kyoto-GHGs in 2030. Pathways that were forced to go through 
the NDCs or a similarly high emissions point in 2030 by design are highlighted by yellow marker edges (see caption of Figure 2.13 and text for further details on the design 
of these pathways). The combined range of global Kyoto-GHG emissions in 2030 for the conditional and unconditional NDCs assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 11 is shown by 
the grey shaded area (adjusted to AR4 GWPs for comparison). As a second line of evidence, peak cumulative CO2 emissions derived from a 1.5°C pathway sensitivity analysis 
(Kriegler et al., 2018b) are shown by grey circles in the right-hand panel. Circles show gross fossil-fuel and industry emissions of the sensitivity cases, increased by assumptions 
about the contributions from AFOLU (5 GtCO2 yr−1 until 2020, followed by a linear phase out until 2040) and non-CO2 Kyoto-GHGs (median non-CO2 contribution from 
1.5°C-consistent pathways available in the database: 10 GtCO2e yr−1 in 2030), and reduced by assumptions about CDR deployment until the time of net zero CO2 emissions 
(limiting case for CDR deployment assumed in (Kriegler et al., 2018b) (logistic growth to 1, 4, 10 GtCO2 yr−1 in 2030, 2040, and 2050, respectively, leading to approximately 
100 GtCO2 of CDR by mid-century).
It is unclear whether following NDCs until 2030 would still allow 
global mean temperature to return to 1.5°C by 2100 after a temporary 
overshoot, due to the uncertainty associated with the Earth system 
response to net negative emissions after a peak (Section 2.2). Available 
IAM studies are working with reduced-form carbon cycle–climate 
models like MAGICC, which assume a largely symmetric Earth-
system response to positive and net negative CO2 emissions. The IAM 
findings on returning warming to 1.5°C from NDCs after a temporary 
temperature overshoot are hence all conditional on this assumption. 
Two types of pathways with 1.5°C-consistent action starting in 2030 
have been considered in the literature (Luderer et al., 2018) (Figure 
2.13): pathways aiming to obtain the same end-of-century carbon 
budget as 1.5°C-consistent pathways starting in 2020 despite higher 
emissions until 2030, and pathways assuming the same mitigation 
stringency after 2030 as in 1.5°C-consistent pathways starting in 
2020 (approximated by using the same global price of emissions as 
found in least-cost pathways starting from 2020). An IAM comparison 
study found increasing challenges to implementing pathways with the 
same end-of-century carbon budgets after following NDCs until 2030 
(Luderer et al., 2018). The majority of model experiments (four out of 
seven) failed to produce NDC pathways that would return cumulative 
CO2 emissions over the 2016–2100 period to 200 GtCO2, indicating 
limitations to the availability and timing of CDR. The few such 
pathways that were identified show highly disruptive features in 2030 
(including abrupt transitions from moderate to very large emissions 
reduction and low carbon energy deployment rates) indicating a high 
risk that the required post-2030 transformations are too steep and 
abrupt to be achieved by the mitigation measures in the models (high 
confidence). NDC pathways aiming for a cumulative 2016–2100 CO2 
emissions budget of 800 GtCO2 were more readily obtained (Luderer et 
al., 2018), and some were classified as 1.5°C-high-OS pathways in this 
assessment (Section 2.1).

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
NDC pathways that apply a post-2030 price of emissions as found in 
least-cost pathways starting from 2020 show infrastructural carbon 
lock-in as a result of following NDCs instead of least-cost action until 
2030. A key finding is that carbon lock-ins persist long after 2030, with 
the majority of additional CO2 emissions occurring during the 2030–
2050 period. Luderer et al. (2018) find 90 (80–120) GtCO2 additional 
emissions until 2030, growing to 240 (190–260) GtCO2 by 2050 and 
290 (200–200) GtCO2 by 2100. As a result, peak warming is about 0.2°C 
higher and not all of the modelled pathways return warming to 1.5°C 
by the end of the century. There is a four sided trade-off between (i) 
near-term ambition, (ii) degree of overshoot, (iii) transitional challenges 
during the 2030–2050 period, and (iv) the amount of CDR deployment 
required during the century (Figure 2.13) (Holz et al., 2018b; Strefler 
et al., 2018b). Transition challenges, overshoot, and CDR requirements 
can be significantly reduced if global emissions peak before 2030 
and fall below levels in line with current NDCs by 2030. For example, 
Strefler et al. (2018b) find that CDR deployment levels in the second 
half of the century can be halved in 1.5°C-consistent pathways with 
similar CO2 emissions reductions rates during the 2030–2050 period 
if CO2 emissions by 2030 are reduced by an additional 30% compared 
to NDC levels. Kriegler et al. (2018a) investigate a global rollout of 
selected regulatory policies and moderate carbon pricing policies. 
They show that additional reductions of about 10 GtCO2e yr−1 can be 
achieved in 2030 compared to the current NDCs. Such a 20% reduction 
of year-2030 emissions compared to current NDCs would effectively 
lower the disruptiveness of post-2030 action. The strengthening of 
short-term policies in deep mitigation pathways has hence been 
identified as a way of bridging options to keep the Paris climate goals 
within reach (Bertram et al., 2015b; IEA, 2015a; Spencer et al., 2015; 
Kriegler et al., 2018a).

Rapid and profound near-term 
decarbonisation of energy supply
Strong upscaling of renewables and sustainable biomass and reduction of unabated (no CCS) fossil fuels, 
along with the rapid deployment of CCS, lead to a zero-emission energy supply system by mid-century.
Section 2.4.1 
Section 2.4.2
Greater mitigation efforts 
on the demand side
All end-use sectors show marked demand reductions beyond the reductions projected for 2°C pathways. Demand 
reductions from IAMs for 2030 and 2050 lie within the potential assessed by detailed sectoral bottom-up assessments. 
Section 2.4.3
Switching from fossil fuels to 
electricity in end-use sectors
Both in the transport and the residential sector, electricity covers markedly larger shares of total demand by mid-century.
Section 2.4.3.2 
Section 2.4.3.3
Comprehensive emission 
reductions are implemented 
in the coming decade
Virtually all 1.5°C-consistent pathways decline net annual CO2 emissions between 2020 and 2030, reaching carbon 
neutrality around mid-century. In 2030, below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways show maximum net CO2 emissions 
of 18 and 28 GtCO2 yr−1, respectively. GHG emissions in these scenarios are not higher than 34 GtCO2e yr−1 in 2030.
Section 2.3.4
Additional reductions, on top of 
reductions from both CO2 and 
non-CO2 required for 2°C, 
are mainly from CO2
Both CO2 and the non-CO2 GHGs and aerosols are strongly reduced by 2030 and until 2050 in 1.5°C pathways.  
The greatest difference to 2°C pathways, however, lies in additional reductions of CO2, as the non-CO2 mitigation 
potential that is currently included in integrated pathways is mostly already fully deployed for reaching a 2°C pathway.
Section 2.3.1.2
Considerable shifts in 
investment patterns
Low-carbon investments in the energy supply side (energy production and refineries) are projected to average 
1.6–3.8 trillion 2010USD yr−1 globally to 2050. Investments in fossil fuels decline, with investments in unabated coal 
halted by 2030 in most available 1.5°C-consistent projections, while the literature is less conclusive for investments 
in unabated gas and oil. Energy demand investments are a critical factor for which total estimates are uncertain.
Section 2.5.2
Options are available to 
align 1.5°C pathways with 
sustainable development
Synergies can be maximized, and risks of trade-offs limited or avoided through an informed choice of mitigation 
strategies. Particularly pathways that focus on a lowering of demand show many synergies and few trade-offs.
Section 2.5.3
CDR at scale before mid-century
By 2050, 1.5°C pathways project deployment of BECCS at a scale of 3–7 GtCO2yr−1 (range of medians across 
1.5°C pathway classes), depending on the level of energy demand reductions and mitigation in other sectors. 
Some 1.5°C pathways are available that do not use BECCS, but only focus terrestrial CDR in the AFOLU sector.

2.4 
Disentangling the Whole-System 
Transformation 
Mitigation pathways map out prospective transformations of the 
energy, land and economic systems over this century (Clarke et al., 
2014). There is a diversity of potential pathways consistent with 1.5°C, 
yet they share some key characteristics summarized in Table 2.5. To 
explore characteristics of 1.5°C pathways in greater detail, this section 
focuses on changes in energy supply and demand, and changes in the 
AFOLU sector.
2.4.1 
Energy System Transformation 
The energy system links energy supply (Section 2.4.2) with energy 
demand (Section 2.4.3) through final energy carriers, including 
electricity and liquid, solid or gaseous fuels, that are tailored to 
their end-uses. To chart energy-system transformations in mitigation 
pathways, four macro-level decarbonization indicators associated with 
final energy are useful: limits on the increase of final energy demand, 
reductions in the carbon intensity of electricity, increases in the share 
of final energy provided by electricity, and reductions in the carbon

(Table 2.1) and illustrative pathway archetypes are indicated in the legend. Values following the class labels give the number of available pathways in each class. 
2.4.2 
Energy Supply
Several energy supply characteristics are evident in 1.5°C pathways 
assessed in this section: (i) growth in the share of energy derived 
from low-carbon-emitting sources (including renewables, nuclear and 
fossil fuel with CCS) and a decline in the overall share of fossil fuels 
without CCS (Section 2.4.2.1), (ii) rapid decline in the carbon intensity 
of electricity generation simultaneous with further electrification of 
energy end-use (Section 2.4.2.2), and (iii) the growth in the use of CCS 
applied to fossil and biomass carbon in most 1.5°C pathways (Section 
2.4.2.3).  
2.4.2.1 Evolution of primary energy contributions over time
By mid-century, the majority of primary energy comes from non-fossil-
fuels (i.e., renewables and nuclear energy) in most 1.5°C pathways 
(Table 2.6). Figure 2.15 shows the evolution of primary energy supply 
over this century across 1.5°C pathways, and in detail for the four 
illustrative pathway archetypes highlighted in this chapter. Note that 
this section reports primary energy using the direct equivalent method 
on the basis of lower heating values (Bruckner et al., 2014).
intensity of final energy other than electricity (referred to in this section 
as the carbon intensity of the residual fuel mix). Figure 2.14 shows 
changes of these four indicators for the pathways in the scenario 
database (Section 2.1.3 and Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3) for 
1.5°C and 2°C pathways (Table 2.1).
Pathways in both the 1.5°C and 2°C classes (Figure 2.14) generally 
show rapid transitions until mid-century, with a sustained but slower 
evolution thereafter. Both show an increasing share of electricity 
accompanied by a rapid decline in the carbon intensity of electricity. 
Both also show a generally slower decline in the carbon intensity of 
the residual fuel mix, which arises from the decarbonization of liquids, 
gases and solids provided to industry, residential and commercial 
activities, and the transport sector.
The largest differences between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways are seen in the 
first half of the century (Figure 2.14), where 1.5°C pathways generally 
show lower energy demand, a faster electrification of energy end-use, 
and a faster decarbonization of the carbon intensity of electricity and 
the residual fuel mix. There are very few pathways in the Below-1.5°C 
class (Figure 2.14). Those scenarios that are available, however, show 
a faster decline in the carbon intensity of electricity generation and 
residual fuel mix by 2030 than most pathways that are projected to 
temporarily overshoot 1.5°C and return by 2100 (or 2°C pathways). 
The Below-1.5°C pathways also appear to differentiate themselves 
from the other pathways as early as 2030 through reductions in final 
energy demand and increases in electricity share (Figure 2.14).

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
The share of energy from renewable sources (including biomass, hydro, 
solar, wind and geothermal) increases in all 1.5°C pathways with no or 
limited overshoot, with the renewable energy share of primary energy 
reaching 38–88% in 2050 (Table 2.6), with an interquartile range of 
52–67%. The magnitude and split between bioenergy, wind, solar, 
and hydro differ between pathways, as can be seen in the illustrative 
pathway archetypes in Figure 2.15. Bioenergy is a major supplier of 
primary energy, contributing to both electricity and other forms of 
final energy such as liquid fuels for transportation (Bauer et al., 2018). 
In 1.5°C pathways, there is a significant growth in bioenergy used in 
combination with CCS for pathways where it is included (Figure 2.15). 
Nuclear power increases its share in most 1.5°C pathways with no or 
limited overshoot by 2050, but in some pathways both the absolute 
capacity and share of power from nuclear generators decrease (Table 
2.15). There are large differences in nuclear power between models 
and across pathways (Kim et al., 2014; Rogelj et al., 2018). One of 
the reasons for this variation is that the future deployment of nuclear 
can be constrained by societal preferences assumed in narratives 
underlying the pathways (O’Neill et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2017b). 
Some 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot no longer see a role 
for nuclear fission by the end of the century, while others project about 
95 EJ yr−1 of nuclear power in 2100 (Figure 2.15). 
The share of primary energy provided by total fossil fuels decreases from 
2020 to 2050 in all 1.5°C pathways, but trends for oil, gas and coal differ 
(Table 2.6). By 2050, the share of primary energy from coal decreases 
to 0–11% across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, with 
an interquartile range of 1–7%. From 2020 to 2050 the primary energy 
supplied by oil changes by −93 to −9% (interquartile range −77 to 
−39%); natural gas changes by −88 to +85% (interquartile range 
−62 to −13%), with varying levels of CCS. Pathways with higher use 
of coal and gas tend to deploy CCS to control their carbon emissions 
(see Section 2.4.2.3). As the energy transition is accelerated by several 
decades in 1.5°C pathways compared to 2°C pathways, residual fossil-
fuel use (i.e., fossil fuels not used for electricity generation) without 
CCS is generally lower in 2050 than in 2°C pathways, while combined 
hydro, solar, and wind power deployment is generally higher than in 
2°C pathways (Figure 2.15).
In addition to the 1.5°C pathways included in the scenario database 
(Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), there are other analyses in the 
Figure 2.15 |  Primary energy supply for the four illustrative pathway archetypes plus the IEA’s Faster Transition Scenario (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017) (panel 
a), and their relative location in the ranges for pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (panel b). The category ‘Other renewables’ 
includes primary energy sources not covered by the other categories, for example, hydro and geothermal energy. The number of pathways that have higher primary energy than the 
scale in the bottom panel are indicated by the numbers above the whiskers. Black horizontal dashed lines indicates the level of primary energy supply in 2015 (IEA, 2017e). Box 
plots in the lower panel show the minimum–maximum range (whiskers), interquartile range (box), and median (vertical thin black line). Symbols in the lower panel show the four 
pathway archetypes S1 (white square), S2 (yellow square), S5 (black square), LED (white disc), as well as the IEA–(red disc). Pathways with no or limited overshoot included the 
Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS classes.

literature including, for example, sector-based analyses of energy 
demand and supply options. Even though they were not necessarily 
developed in the context of the 1.5°C target, they explore in greater 
detail some options for deep reductions in GHG emissions. For example, 
there are analyses of transitions to up to 100% renewable energy by 
2050 (Creutzig et al., 2017; Jacobson et al., 2017), which describe 
what is entailed for a renewable energy share largely from solar and 
wind (and electrification) that is above the range of 1.5°C pathways 
available in the database, although there have been challenges to the 
assumptions used in high-renewable analyses (e.g., Clack et al., 2017). 
There are also analyses that result in a large role for nuclear energy 
in mitigation of GHGs (Hong et al., 2015; Berger et al., 2017a, b; Xiao 
and Jiang, 2018). BECCS could also contribute a larger share, but faces 
challenges related to its land use and impact on food supply (Burns 
and Nicholson, 2017) (assessed in greater detail in Sections 2.3.4.2, 
4.3.7 and 5.4). These analyses could, provided their assumptions prove 
plausible, expand the range of 1.5°C pathways.
In summary, the share of primary energy from renewables increases 
while that from coal decreases across 1.5°C pathways (high 
confidence). This statement is true for all 1.5°C pathways in the 
scenario database and associated literature (Supplementary Material 
2.SM.1.3), and is consistent with the additional studies mentioned 
above, an increase in energy supply from lower-carbon-intensity 
energy supply, and a decrease in energy supply from higher-carbon-
intensity energy supply.

2.4.2.2 Evolution of electricity supply over time
Electricity supplies an increasing share of final energy, reaching 
34–71% in 2050, across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot 
(Figure 2.14), extending the historical increases in electricity share 
seen over the past decades (Bruckner et al., 2014). From 2020 to 2050, 
the quantity of electricity supplied in most 1.5°C pathways with no or 
limited overshoot more than doubles (Table 2.7). By 2050, the carbon 
intensity of electricity has fallen rapidly to −92 to +11 gCO2 MJ−1 
electricity across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot from 
a value of around 140 gCO2 MJ−1 (range: 88–181 gCO2 MJ−1) in 2020 
(Figure 2.14). A negative contribution to carbon intensity is provided by 
BECCS in most pathways (Figure 2.16).
By 2050, the share of electricity supplied by renewables increases from 
23% in 2015 (IEA, 2017b) to 59–97% across 1.5°C pathways with no 
or limited overshoot. Wind, solar, and biomass together make a major 
contribution in 2050, although the share for each spans a wide range 
across 1.5°C pathways (Figure 2.16). Fossil fuels on the other hand 
have a decreasing role in electricity supply, with their share falling to 
0–25% by 2050 (Table 2.7).
In summary, 1.5°C pathways include a rapid decline in the carbon 
intensity of electricity and an increase in electrification of energy end-
use (high confidence). This is the case across all 1.5°C pathways and 
their associated literature (Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), with 
pathway trends that extend those seen in past decades, and results 
that are consistent with additional analyses (see Section 2.4.2.2).
2.4.2.3 Deployment of carbon capture and storage
Studies have shown the importance of CCS for deep mitigation pathways 
(Krey et al., 2014a; Kriegler et al., 2014b), based on its multiple roles to 
limit fossil-fuel emissions in electricity generation, liquids production, 
and industry applications along with the projected ability to remove 
CO2 from the atmosphere when combined with bioenergy. This remains 
a valid finding for those 1.5°C and 2°C pathways that do not radically 
reduce energy demand or do not offer carbon-neutral alternatives to 
liquids and gases that do not rely on bioenergy.
There is a wide range of CCS that is deployed across 1.5°C pathways 
(Figure 2.17). A few 1.5°C pathways with very low energy demand 
do not include CCS at all (Grubler et al., 2018). For example, the LED 
pathway has no CCS, whereas other pathways, such as the S5 pathway,

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
Figure 2.16 |  Electricity generation for the four illustrative pathway archetypes plus the IEA’s Faster Transition Scenario (IEA, 2017d) (panel a), and their 
relative location in the ranges for pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (panel b). The category ‘Other renewables’ includes electricity 
generation not covered by the other categories, for example, hydro and geothermal. The number of pathways that have higher primary energy than the scale in the bottom panel 
are indicated by the numbers above the whiskers. Black horizontal dashed lines indicate the level of primary energy supply in 2015 (IEA, 2017e). Box plots in the lower panel show 
the minimum–maximum range (whiskers), interquartile range (box), and median (vertical thin black line). Symbols in the lower panel show the four pathway archetypes – S1 (white 
square), S2 (yellow square), S5 (black square), LED (white disc) – as well as the IEA’s Faster Transition Scenario (red disc). Pathways with no or limited overshoot included the Below-
1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS classes.  
rely on a large amount of BECCS to get to net-zero carbon emissions. 
The cumulative fossil and biomass CO2 stored through 2050 ranges from 
zero to 300 GtCO2 across 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, 
with zero up to 140 GtCO2 from biomass captured and stored. Some 
pathways have very low fossil-fuel use overall, and consequently little 
CCS applied to fossil fuels. In 1.5°C pathways where the 2050 coal use 
remains above 20 EJ yr−1 in 2050, 33–100% is combined with CCS. 
While deployment of CCS for natural gas and coal vary widely across 
pathways, there is greater natural gas primary energy connected to 
CCS than coal primary energy connected to CCS in many pathways 
(Figure 2.17).
CCS combined with fossil-fuel use remains limited in some 1.5°C 
pathways (Rogelj et al., 2018), as the limited 1.5°C carbon budget 
penalizes CCS if it is assumed to have incomplete capture rates or if 
fossil fuels are assumed to continue to have significant lifecycle GHG 
emissions (Pehl et al., 2017). However, high capture rates are technically 
achievable now at higher cost, although efforts to date have focussed 
on reducing the costs of capture (IEAGHG, 2006; NETL, 2013).
The quantity of CO2 stored via CCS over this century in 1.5°C pathways 
with no or limited overshoot ranges from zero to more than 1,200 
GtCO2, (Figure 2.17). The IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide 
Capture and Storage (IPCC, 2005) found that that, worldwide, it is 
likely that there is a technical potential of at least about 2,000 GtCO2 
of storage capacity in geological formations. Furthermore, the IPCC 
(2005) recognized that there could be a much larger potential for 
geological storage in saline formations, but the upper limit estimates 
are uncertain due to lack of information and an agreed methodology. 
Since IPCC (2005), understanding has improved and there have been 
detailed regional surveys of storage capacity (Vangkilde-Pedersen 
et al., 2009; Ogawa et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013; Bentham et al., 
2014; Riis and Halland, 2014; Warwick et al., 2014; NETL, 2015) and 
improvement and standardization of methodologies (e.g., Bachu et al. 
2007a, b). Dooley (2013) synthesized published literature on both the 
global geological storage resource as well as the potential demand 
for geologic storage in mitigation pathways, and found that the 
cumulative demand for CO2 storage was small compared to a practical 
storage capacity estimate (as defined by Bachu et al., 2007a) of 3,900 
GtCO2 worldwide. Differences remain, however, in estimates of storage 
capacity due to, for example, the potential storage limitations of 
136
Chapter 2 
Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development
2
subsurface pressure build-up (Szulczewski et al., 2014) and assumptions 
on practices that could manage such issues (Bachu, 2015). Kearns et 
al. (2017) constructed estimates of global storage capacity of 8,000 to 
55,000 GtCO2 (accounting for differences in detailed regional and local 
estimates), which is sufficient at a global level for this century, but 
found that at a regional level, robust demand for CO2 storage exceeds 
their lower estimate of regional storage available for some regions. 
However, storage capacity is not solely determined by the geological 
setting, and Bachu (2015) describes storage engineering practices 
that could further extend storage capacity estimates. In summary, 
the storage capacity of all of these global estimates is larger than the 
cumulative CO2 stored via CCS in 1.5°C pathways over this century.
There is uncertainty in the future deployment of CCS given the 
limited pace of current deployment, the evolution of CCS technology 
that would be associated with deployment, and the current lack of 
incentives for large-scale implementation of CCS (Bruckner et al., 2014; 
Clarke et al., 2014; Riahi et al., 2017). Given the importance of CCS in 
most mitigation pathways and its current slow pace of improvement, 
the large-scale deployment of CCS as an option depends on the further 
development of the technology in the near term. Chapter 4 discusses 
how progress on CCS might be accelerated.
2.4.3 
Energy End-Use Sectors
Since the power sector is almost decarbonized by mid-century in both 
1.5°C and 2°C pathways, major differences come from CO2 emission 
reductions in end-use sectors. Energy-demand reductions are key 
and common features in 1.5˚C pathways, and they can be achieved 
by efficiency improvements and various specific demand-reduction 
measures. Another important feature is end-use decarbonization 
including by electrification, although the potential and challenges in 
each end-use sector vary significantly. 
In the following sections, the potential and challenges of CO2 emission 
reductions towards 1.5°C and 2°C- consistent pathways are discussed 
for each end-use energy sector (industry, buildings, and transport). 
For this purpose, two types of pathways are analysed and compared: 
IAM (integrated assessment modelling) studies and sectoral (detailed) 
studies. IAM data are extracted from the database that was compiled 
for this assessment (see Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.3), and the 
sectoral data are taken from a recent series of publications; ‘Energy 
Technology Perspectives’ (ETP) (IEA, 2014, 2015b, 2016a, 2017a), the 
IEA/IRENA report (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017), and the Shell Sky report 
(Shell International B.V., 2018). The IAM pathways are categorized 
according to their temperature rise in 2100 and the overshoot of 
temperature during the century (see Table 2.1 in Section 2.1). Since 
the number of Below-1.5°C pathways is small, the following analyses 
Figure 2.17 |  CCS deployment in 1.5°C and 2°C pathways for (a) biomass, (b) coal and (c) natural gas (EJ of primary energy) and (d) the cumulative quantity 
of fossil (including from, e.g., cement production) and biomass CO2 stored via CCS (in GtCO2 stored).  TBox plots show median, interquartile range and full range of 
pathways in each temperature class. Pathway temperature classes (Table 2.1), illustrative pathway archetypes, and the IEA’s Faster Transition Scenario (IEA WEM) (OECD/IEA and 
IRENA, 2017) are indicated in the legend.

or IAM-1.5DS-OS) and 2°C-consistent pathways (IAM-2DS). In order to 
show the diversity of IAM pathways, we again show specific data from 
the four illustrative pathways archetypes used throughout this chapter 
(see Sections 2.1 and 2.3).
IEA ETP-B2DS (‘Beyond 2 Degrees’) and ETP-2DS are pathways with 
a 50% chance of limiting temperature rise below 1.75°C and 2°C 
by 2100, respectively (IEA, 2017a). The IEA-66%2DS pathway keeps 
global mean temperature rise below 2°C, not just in 2100 but also 
over the course of the 21st century, with a 66% chance of being below 
2°C by 2100 (OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). The comparison of CO2 
emission trajectories between ETP-B2DS and IAM-1.5DS-OS show that 
these are consistent up to 2060 (Figure 2.18). IEA scenarios assume 
that only a very low level of BECCS is deployed to help offset emissions 
in difficult-to-decarbonize sectors, and that global energy-related CO2 
emissions do not turn net negative at any time but stay at zero from 
2060 to 2100 (IEA, 2017a). Therefore, although its temperature rise 
in 2100 is below 1.75°C rather than below 1.5°C, this scenario can 
give information related to a 1.5°C overshoot pathway up to 2050. 
The trajectory of IEA-66%2DS (also referred to in other publications as 
IEA’s ‘Faster Transition Scenario’) lies between IAM-1.5DS-OS and IAM-
2DS pathway ranges, and IEA-2DS stays in the range of 2°C-consistent 
IAM pathways. The Shell-Sky scenario aims to hold the temperature 
rise to well below 2°C, but it is a delayed action pathway relative to 
others, as can be seen in Figure 2.18.
Energy-demand reduction measures are key to reducing CO2 emissions 
from end-use sectors for low-carbon pathways. The upstream energy 
reductions can be from several times to an order of magnitude larger 
than the initial end-use demand reduction. There are interdependencies 
among the end-use sectors and between energy-supply and end-use 
sectors, which elevate the importance of a wide, systematic approach. 
As shown in Figure 2.19, global final energy consumption grows by 30% 
and 10% from 2010 to 2050 for 2°C-consistent and 1.5°C overshoot 
pathways from IAMs, respectively, while much higher growth of 75% is 
projected for reference scenarios. The ranges within a specific pathway 
class are due to a variety of factors as introduced in Section 2.3.1, as 
well as differences between modelling frameworks. The important 
energy efficiency and conservation improvements that facilitate many 
of the 1.5°C pathways raise the issue of potential rebound effects 
(Saunders, 2015), which, while promoting development, can make 
the achievement of low-energy demand futures more difficult than 
modelling studies anticipate (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6).
Final energy demand is driven by demand in energy services for 
mobility, residential and commercial activities (buildings), and 
manufacturing. Projections of final energy demand depend heavily on 
assumptions about socio-economic futures as represented by the SSPs 
(Bauer et al., 2017) (see Sections 2.1, 2.3 and 2.5). The structure of this 
demand drives the composition of final energy use in terms of energy 
carriers (electricity, liquids, gases, solids, hydrogen etc.).
Figure 2.19 shows the structure of global final energy demand in 2030 
and 2050, indicating the trend toward electrification and fossil fuel 
usage reduction. This trend is more significant in 1.5°C pathways than 
2°C pathways. Electrification continues throughout the second half of 
the century, leading to a 3.5- to 6-fold increase in electricity demand 
(interquartile range; median 4.5) by the end of the century relative to 
today (Grubler et al., 2018; Luderer et al., 2018). Since the electricity 
sector is completely decarbonized by mid-century in 1.5°C pathways 
(see Figure 2.20), electrification is the primary means to decarbonize 
energy end-use sectors. 
The CO2 emissions6  of end-use sectors and carbon intensity are shown 
in Figure 2.20. The projections of IAMs and IEA studies show rather 
different trends, especially in the carbon intensity. These differences 
come from various factors, including the deployment of CCS, the 
level of fuel switching and efficiency improvements, and the effect 
of structural and behavioural changes. IAM projections are generally 
optimistic for the industry sectors, but not for buildings and transport 
sectors. Although GDP increases by a factor of 3.4 from 2010 to 2050, 
the total energy consumption of end-use sectors grows by only about 
30% and 20% in 1.5°C overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways, 
respectively. However, CO2 emissions would need to be reduced further 
to achieve the stringent temperature limits. Figure 2.20 shows that the 
reduction in CO2 emissions of end-use sectors is larger and more rapid 
in 1.5°C overshoot than 2°C-consistent pathways, while emissions 
from the power sector are already almost zero in 2050 in both sets 
of pathways, indicating that supply-side emissions reductions are 
almost fully exploited already in 2°C-consistent pathways (see Figure 
2.20) (Rogelj et al., 2015b, 2018; Luderer et al., 2016b). The emission 
reductions in end-use sectors are largely made possible by efficiency 
improvements, demand reduction measures and electrification, but 
the level of emissions reductions varies across end-use sectors. While 
the carbon intensity of the industry and buildings sectors decreases 
6 
This section reports ‘direct’ CO2 emissions as reported for pathways in the database for the report. As shown below, the emissions from electricity are nearly zero around 
2050, so the impact of indirect emissions on the whole emission contributions of each sector is very small in 2050.

to a very low level of around 10 gCO2 MJ-1, the carbon intensity of 
transport becomes the highest of any sector by 2040 due to its higher 
reliance on oil-based fuels. In the following subsections, the potential 
and challenges of CO2 emission reduction in each end-use sector are 
discussed in detail.
2.4.3.1 Industry
The industry sector is the largest end-use sector, both in terms of 
final energy demand and GHG emissions. Its direct CO2 emissions 
currently account for about 25% of total energy-related and process 
CO2 emissions, and emissions have increased at an average annual 
rate of 3.4% between 2000 and 2014, significantly faster than total 
CO2 emissions (Hoesly et al., 2018). In addition to emissions from 
the combustion of fossil fuels, non-energy uses of fossil fuels in the 
petrochemical industry and metal smelting, as well as non-fossil fuel 
process emissions (e.g., from cement production) contribute a small 
amount (~5%) to the sector’s CO2 emissions inventory. Material 
industries are particularly energy and emissions intensive: together, 
the steel, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, and 
pulp and paper industries accounted for close to 66% of final energy 
demand and 72% of direct industry-sector emissions in 2014 (IEA, 
2017a). In terms of end-uses, the bulk of energy in manufacturing 
industries is required for process heating and steam generation, 
while most electricity (but smaller shares of total final energy) is used 
for mechanical work (Banerjee et al., 2012; IEA, 2017a).
As shown in Figure 2.21, a major share of the additional emission 
reductions required for 1.5°C-overshoot pathways compared to 
those in 2°C-consistent pathways comes from industry. Final energy, 
CO2 emissions, and carbon intensity are consistent in IAM and 
sectoral studies, but in IAM-1.5°C-overshoot pathways the share of 
electricity is higher than IEA-B2DS (40% vs. 25%) and hydrogen is 
also considered to have a share of about 5% versus 0%. In 2050, final 
energy is increased by 30% and 5% compared with the 2010 level 
(red dotted line) for 1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways, 
respectively, but CO2 emissions are decreased by 80% and 50% 
and carbon intensity by 80% and 60%, respectively. This additional 
decarbonization is brought by switching to low-carbon fuels and CCS 
deployment.

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development

Broadly speaking, the industry sector’s mitigation measures can 
be categorized in terms of the following five strategies: (i) reducing 
demand, (ii) energy efficiency, (iii) increasing electrification of energy 
demand, (iv) reducing the carbon content of non-electric fuels, and 
(v) deploying innovative processes and application of CCS. IEA ETP 
estimates the relative contribution of different measures for CO2 
emission reduction in their B2DS scenario compared with their reference 
scenario in 2050 as follows: energy efficiency 42%, innovative process 
and CCS 37%, switching to low-carbon fuels and feedstocks 13% and 
material efficiency (include efficient production and use to contribute 
to demand reduction) 8%. The remainder of this section delves more 
deeply into the potential mitigation contributions of these strategies as 
well as their limitations.
Reduction in the use of industrial materials, while delivering similar 
services, or improving the quality of products could help to reduce 
energy demand and overall system-level CO2 emissions. Strategies 
include using materials more intensively, extending product lifetimes, 
increasing recycling, and increasing inter-industry material synergies, 
such as clinker substitution in cement production (Allwood et al., 2013; 
IEA, 2017a). Related to material efficiency, use of fossil-fuel feedstocks 
could shift to lower-carbon feedstocks, such as from oil to natural gas 
and biomass, and end-uses could shift to more sustainable materials, 
such as biomass-based materials, reducing the demand for energy-
intensive materials (IEA, 2017a).
Reaping energy efficiency potentials hinges critically on advanced 
management practices, such as energy management systems, in 
industrial facilities as well as targeted policies to accelerate adoption of 
the best available technology (see Section 2.5). Although excess energy, 
usually as waste heat, is inevitable, recovering and reusing this waste 
heat under economically and technically viable conditions benefits 
the overall energy system. Furthermore, demand-side management 
strategies could modulate the level of industrial activity in line with 
the availability of resources in the power system. This could imply a 
shift away from peak demand and as power supply decarbonizes, this 
demand-shaping potential could shift some load to times with high 
portions of low-carbon electricity generation (IEA, 2017a).
In the industry sector, energy demand increases more than 40% 
between 2010 and 2050 in baseline scenarios. However, in the 
1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent pathways from IAMs, the increase 
is only 30% and 5%, respectively (Figure 2.21). These energy-demand 
reductions encompass both efficiency improvements in production and 
reductions in material demand, as most IAMs do not discern these two 
factors.
CO2 emissions from industry increase by 30% in 2050 compared to 
2010 in baseline scenarios. By contrast, these emissions are reduced 
by 80% and 50% relative to 2010 levels in 1.5°C-overshoot and 
2°C-consistent pathways from IAMs, respectively (Figure 2.21). By mid-
century, CO2 emissions per unit of electricity are projected to decrease 
to near zero in both sets of pathways (see Figure 2.20). An accelerated 
electrification of the industry sector thus becomes an increasingly 
powerful mitigation option. In the IAM pathways, the share of electricity 
increases up to 30% by 2050 in 1.5°C-overshoot pathways (Figure 
2.21) from 20% in 2010. Some industrial fuel uses are substantially 
more difficult to electrify than others, and electrification would have 
other effects on the process, including impacts on plant design, cost 
and available process integration options (IEA, 2017a).7  
In 1.5°C-overshoot pathways, the carbon intensity of non-electric fuels 
consumed by industry decreases to 16 gCO2 MJ−1 by 2050, compared 
to 25 gCO2 MJ−1 in 2°C-consistent pathways. Considerable carbon 
intensity reductions are already achieved by 2030, largely via a rapid 
phase-out of coal. Biomass becomes an increasingly important energy 
carrier in the industry sector in deep-decarbonization pathways, but 
primarily in the longer term (in 2050, biomass accounts for only 10% 
of final energy consumption even in 1.5°C-overshoot pathways). In 
addition, hydrogen plays a considerable role as a substitute for fossil-
based non-electric energy demands in some pathways.
Without major deployment of new sustainability-oriented low-carbon 
industrial processes, the 1.5°C-overshoot target is difficult to achieve. 
Bringing such technologies and processes to commercial deployment 
requires significant investment in research and development. Some 
examples of innovative low-carbon process routes include: new 
steelmaking processes such as upgraded smelt reduction and upgraded 
direct reduced iron, inert anodes for aluminium smelting, and full oxy-
fuelling kilns for clinker production in cement manufacturing (IEA, 
2017a). 
CCS plays a major role in decarbonizing the industry sector in the 
context of 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, especially in industries with 
higher process emissions, such as cement, iron and steel industries. 
In 1.5°C-overshoot pathways, CCS in industry reaches 3 GtCO2 yr−1 
by 2050, albeit with strong variations across pathways. Given the 
projected long-lead times and need for technological innovation, early 
scale-up of industry-sector CCS is essential to achieving the stringent 
temperature target. Development and demonstration of such projects 
has been slow, however. Currently, only two large-scale industrial CCS 
projects outside of oil and gas processing are in operation (Global 
CCS Institute, 2016). The estimated current cost8 of CO2 avoided (in 
USD2015) ranges from $20–27 tCO2
−1 for gas processing and bio-
ethanol production, and $60–138 tCO2
−1 for fossil fuel-fired power 
generation up to $104–188 tCO2
−1 for cement production (Irlam, 2017).
2.4.3.2 Buildings
In 2014, the buildings sector accounted for 31% of total global final 
energy use, 54% of final electricity demand, and 8% of energy-related 
CO2 emissions (excluding indirect emissions due to electricity). When

Electrification can be linked with the heating and drying process by electric boilers and electro-thermal processes, and also with low-temperature heat demand by heat  
 
pumps. In the iron and steel industry, hydrogen produced by electrolysis can be used as a reduction agent of iron instead of coke. Excess resources, such as black liquor,  
 
will provide the opportunity to increase the systematic efficiency to use for electricity generation.

These are first-of-a-kind (FOAK) cost data.

Chapter 2
upstream electricity generation is taken into account, buildings were 
responsible for 23% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, with one-
third of those from direct fossil fuel consumption (IEA, 2017a).
Past growth of energy consumption has been mainly driven by 
population and economic growth, with improved access to electricity, 
and higher use of electrical appliances and space cooling resulting 
from increasing living standards, especially in developing countries 
(Lucon et al., 2014). These trends will continue in the future and in 
2050, energy consumption is projected to increase by 20% and 50% 
compared to 2010 in the IAM-1.5°C-overshoot and 2°C-consistent 
pathways, respectively (Figure 2.22). However, sectoral studies (IEA-
ETP scenarios) show different trends. Energy consumption in 2050 
decreases compared to 2010 in ETP-B2DS, and the reduction rate of 
CO2 emissions is higher than in IAM pathways (Figure 2.22). Mitigation 
options are often more widely covered in sectoral studies (Lucon et al., 
2014), leading to greater reductions in energy consumption and CO2 
emissions.
Emissions reductions are driven by a clear tempering of energy 
demand and a strong electrification of the buildings sector. The share 
of electricity in 2050 is 60% in 1.5°C-overshoot pathways, compared 
with 50% in 2°C-consistent pathways (Figure 2.22). Electrification 
contributes to the reduction of direct CO2 emissions by replacing 
carbon-intensive fuels, like oil and coal. Furthermore, when combined 
with a rapid decarbonization of the power system (see Section 2.4.1) it 
also enables further reduction of indirect CO2 emissions from electricity. 
Sectoral bottom-up models generally estimate lower electrification 
potentials for the buildings sector in comparison to global IAMs (see 
Figure 2.22). Besides CO2 emissions, increasing global demand for 
air conditioning in buildings may also lead to increased emissions of 
HFCs in this sector over the next few decades. Although these gases 
are currently a relatively small proportion of annual GHG emissions, 
their use in the air conditioning sector is expected to grow rapidly over 
the next few decades if alternatives are not adopted. However, their 
projected future impact can be significantly mitigated through better 
servicing and maintenance of equipment and switching of cooling 
gases (Shah et al., 2015; Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson, 2017).
IEA-ETP (IEA, 2017a) analysed the relative importance of various 
technology measures toward the reduction of energy and CO2 
emissions in the buildings sector. The largest energy savings potential 
is in heating and cooling demand, largely due to building envelope 
improvements and high efficiency and renewable equipment. In the

ETP-B2DS, energy demand for space heating and cooling is 33% lower 
in 2050 than in the reference scenario, and these reductions account 
for 54% of total reductions from the reference scenario. Energy savings 
from shifts to high-performance lighting, appliances, and water heating 
equipment account for a further 24% of the total reduction. The long-
term, strategic shift away from fossil-fuel use in buildings, alongside 
the rapid uptake of energy efficient, integrated and renewable 
energy technologies (with clean power generation), leads to a drastic 
reduction of CO2 emissions. In ETP-B2DS, the direct CO2 emissions are 
79% lower than the reference scenario in 2050, and the remaining 
emissions come mainly from the continued use of natural gas.
The buildings sector is characterized by very long-living infrastructure, 
and immediate steps are hence important to avoid lock-in of inefficient 
carbon and energy-intensive buildings. This applies both to new buildings 
in developing countries where substantial new construction is expected 
in the near future and to retrofits of existing building stock in developed 
regions. This represents both a significant risk and opportunity for 
mitigation.9 A recent study highlights the benefits of deploying the most 
advanced renovation technologies, which would avoid lock-in into less 
efficient measures (Güneralp et al., 2017). Aside from the effect of building 
envelope measures, adoption of energy-efficient technologies such as 
heat pumps and, more recently, light-emitting diodes is also important 
for the reduction of energy and CO2 emissions (IEA, 2017a). Consumer 
choices, behaviour and building operation can also significantly affect 
energy consumption (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3).
2.4.3.3 Transport
Transport accounted for 28% of global final energy demand and 23% 
of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2014. Emissions increased by 
2.5% annually between 2010 and 2015, and over the past half century 
the sector has witnessed faster emissions growth than any other. The 
transport sector is the least diversified energy end-use sector; the 
sector consumed 65% of global oil final energy demand, with 92% of 
transport final energy demand consisting of oil products (IEA, 2017a), 
suggesting major challenges for deep decarbonization.
Final energy, CO2 emissions, and carbon intensity for the transport 
sector are shown in Figure 2.23. The projections of IAMs are more 
pessimistic than IEA-ETP scenarios, though both clearly project deep 
cuts in energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 2050. For example, 
1.5°C-overshoot pathways from IAMs project a reduction of 15% in 
energy consumption between 2015 and 2050, while ETP-B2DS projects 
a reduction of 30% (Figure 2.23). Furthermore, IAM pathways are 
generally more pessimistic in the projections of CO2 emissions and 
carbon intensity reductions. In AR5 (Clarke et al., 2014; Sims et al., 
2014), similar comparisons between IAMs and sectoral studies were 
performed and these were in good agreement with each other. Since 
the AR5, two important changes can be identified: rapid growth of 
electric vehicle sales in passenger cars, and more attention towards 
structural changes in this sector. The former contributes to reduction 
of CO2 emissions and the latter to reduction of energy consumption. 
Deep emissions reductions in the transport sector would be achieved by 
several means. Technology-focused measures such as energy efficiency 
and fuel-switching are two of these. Structural changes that avoid or 
shift transport activity are also important. While the former solutions 
(technologies) always tend to figure into deep decarbonization 
pathways in a major way, this is not always the case with the latter, 
especially in IAM pathways. Comparing different types of global 
transport models, Yeh et al. (2016) find that sectoral (intensive) studies 
generally envision greater mitigation potential from structural changes 
in transport activity and modal choice. Though, even there, it is primarily 
the switching of passengers and freight from less- to more-efficient 
travel modes (e.g., cars, trucks and airplanes to buses and trains) that is 
the main strategy; other actions, such as increasing vehicle load factors 
(occupancy rates) and outright reductions in travel demand (e.g., as 
a result of integrated transport, land-use and urban planning), figure 
much less prominently. Whether these dynamics accurately reflect the 
actual mitigation potential of structural changes in transport activity 
and modal choice is a point of investigation. According to the recent 
IEA-ETP scenarios, the share of avoid (reduction of mobility demand) 
and shift (shifting to more efficient modes) measures in the reduction of 
CO2 emissions from the reference to B2DS scenarios in 2050 amounts 
to 20% (IEA, 2017a). 
The potential and strategies to reduce energy consumption and CO2 
emissions differ significantly among transport modes. In ETP-B2DS, 
the shares of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in 2050 for each 
mode are rather different (see Table 2.8), indicating the challenge 
of decarbonizing heavy-duty vehicles (HDV, trucks), aviation, and 
shipping. The reduction of CO2 emissions in the whole sector from 
the reference scenario to ETP-B2DS is 60% in 2050, with varying 
contributions per mode (Table 2.8). Since there is no silver bullet for 
this deep decarbonization, every possible measure would be required 
to achieve this stringent emissions outcome. The contribution of 
various measures for the CO2 emission reduction from the reference 
scenario to the IEA-B2DS in 2050 can be decomposed to efficiency 
improvement (29%), biofuels (36%), electrification (15%), and avoid/
shift (20%) (IEA, 2017a). It is noted that the share of electrification 
becomes larger compared with older studies, reflected by the recent 
growth of electric vehicle sales worldwide. Another new trend is the 
allocation of biofuels to each mode of transport. In IEA-B2DS, the total 
amount of biofuels consumed in the transport sector is 24EJ10 in 2060, 
and allocated to LDV (light-duty vehicles, 17%), HDV (35%), aviation 
(28%), and shipping (21%), that is, more biofuels is allocated to the 
difficult-to-decarbonize modes (see Table 2.8).
In road transport, incremental vehicle improvements (including 
engines) are relevant, especially in the short to medium term. Hybrid 
electric vehicles are also instrumental to enabling the transition from 
9 
In this section, we only discuss the direct emissions from the sector, but the selection of building materials has a significant impact on the reduction of energy and emissions  
 
during production, such as shift from the steel and concrete to wood-based materials.
10 This is estimated for the biofuels produced in a “sustainable manner” from non-food crop feedstocks, which are capable of delivering significant lifecycle GHG emissions 
savings compared with fossil fuel alternatives, and which do not directly compete with food and feed crops for agricultural land or cause adverse sustainability impacts.

internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles, especially 
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Electrification is a powerful measure to 
decarbonize short-distance vehicles (passenger cars and two and three 
wheelers) and the rail sector. In road freight transport (trucks), systemic 
improvements (e.g., in supply chains, logistics, and routing) would be 
effective measures in conjunction with efficiency improvement of 
vehicles. Shipping and aviation are more challenging to decarbonize, 
while their demand growth is projected to be higher than other

efficiency improvements and use of low-carbon fuels. In the near and 
medium term, this would be advanced biofuels while in the long term 
it could be hydrogen as direct use for shipping or an intermediate 
product for synthetic fuels for both modes (IEA, 2017a).
The share of low-carbon fuels in the total transport fuel mix 
increases to 10% and 16% by 2030 and to 40% and 58% by 2050

in 1.5°C-overshoot pathways from IAMs and the IEA-B2DS pathway, 
respectively. The IEA-B2DS scenario is on the more ambitious side, 
especially in the share of electricity. Hence, there is wide variation 
among scenarios, including the IAM pathways, regarding changes 
in the transport fuel mix over the first half of the century. As seen in 
Figure 2.23, the projections of energy consumption, CO2 emissions and 
carbon intensity are quite different between IAM and ETP scenarios. 
These differences can be explained by more weight on efficiency 
improvements and avoid/shift decreasing energy consumption, and 
the higher share of biofuels and electricity accelerating the speed of 
decarbonization in ETP scenarios. Although biofuel consumption and 
electric vehicle sales have increased significantly in recent years, the 
growth rates projected in these pathways would be unprecedented 
and far higher than has been experienced to date.
The 1.5°C pathways require an acceleration of the mitigation solutions 
already featured in 2°C-consistent pathways (e.g., more efficient 
vehicle technologies operating on lower-carbon fuels), as well as 
those having received lesser attention in most global transport 
decarbonization pathways up to now (e.g., mode-shifting and travel 
demand management). Current-generation, global pathways generally 
do not include these newer transport sector developments, whereby 
technological solutions are related to shifts in traveller’s behaviour.
2.4.4 
Land-Use Transitions and Changes 
in the Agricultural Sector
The agricultural and land system described together under the umbrella 
of the AFOLU (agriculture, forestry, and other land use) sector plays 
an important role in 1.5°C pathways (Clarke et al., 2014; Smith and 
Bustamante, 2014; Popp et al., 2017). On the one hand, its emissions 
need to be limited over the course of this century to be in line with 
pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (see Sections 2.2-3). On the other 
hand, the AFOLU system is responsible for food and feed production; 
for wood production for pulp and construction; for the production of 
biomass that is used for energy, CDR or other uses; and for the supply of 
non-provisioning (ecosystem) services (Smith and Bustamante, 2014). 
Meeting all demands together requires changes in land use, as well as 
in agricultural and forestry practices, for which a multitude of potential 
options have been identified (Smith and Bustamante, 2014; Popp et 
al., 2017) (see also Supplementary Material  2.SM.1.2 and Chapter 4, 
Section 4.3.1, 4.3.2 and 4.3.7). 
This section assesses the transformation of the AFOLU system, mainly 
making use of pathways from IAMs (see Section 2.1) that are based on 
quantifications of the SSPs and that report distinct land-use evolutions 
in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C (Calvin et al., 2017; Fricko et 
al., 2017; Fujimori, 2017; Kriegler et al., 2017; Popp et al., 2017; Riahi 
et al., 2017; van Vuuren et al., 2017b; Doelman et al., 2018; Rogelj 
et al., 2018). The SSPs were designed to vary mitigation challenges 
(O’Neill et al., 2014) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1), including 
for the AFOLU sector (Popp et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017). The SSP 
pathway ensemble hence allows for a structured exploration of AFOLU 
transitions in the context of climate change mitigation in line with 
1.5°C, taking into account technological and socio-economic aspects. 
Other considerations, like food security, livelihoods and biodiversity, 
are also of importance when identifying AFOLU strategies. These are 
at present only tangentially explored by the SSPs. Further assessments 
of AFOLU mitigation options are provided in other parts of this report 
and in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL). 
Chapter 4 provides an assessment of bioenergy (including feedstocks, 
see Section 4.3.1), livestock management (Section 4.3.1), reducing 
rates of deforestation and other land-based mitigation options (as 
mitigation and adaptation option, see Section 4.3.2), and BECCS, 
afforestation and reforestation options (including the bottom-up 
literature of their sustainable potential, mitigation cost and side 
effects, Section 4.3.7). Chapter 3 discusses impacts land-based CDR 
(Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3). Chapter 5 assesses the sustainable 
development implications of AFOLU mitigation, including impacts on 
biodiversity (Section 5.4). Finally, the SRCCL will undertake a more 
comprehensive assessment of land and climate change aspects. For 
the sake of complementarity, this section focusses on the magnitude 
and pace of land transitions in 1.5°C pathways, as well as on the 
implications of different AFOLU mitigation strategies for different land 
types. The interactions with other societal objectives and potential 
limitations of identified AFOLU measures link to these large-scale 
evolutions, but these are assessed elsewhere (see above).
Land-use changes until mid-century occur in the large majority of 
SSP pathways, both under stringent mitigation and in absence of 
mitigation (Figure 2.24). In the latter case, changes are mainly due 
to socio-economic drivers like growing demands for food, feed and 
wood products. General transition trends can be identified for many 
land types in 1.5°C pathways, which differ from those in baseline 
scenarios and depend on the interplay with mitigation in other 
sectors (Figure 2.24) (Popp et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et 
al., 2018). Mitigation that demands land mainly occurs at the expense 
of agricultural land for food and feed production. Additionally, some 
biomass is projected to be grown on marginal land or supplied from 
residues and waste, but at lower shares. Land for second-generation 
energy crops (such as Miscanthus or poplar) expands by 2030 
and 2050 in all available pathways that assume a cost-effective 
achievement of a 1.5°C temperature goal in 2100 (Figure 2.24), but 
the scale depends strongly on underlying socio-economic assumptions 
(see later discussion of land pathway archetypes). Reducing rates of 
deforestation restricts agricultural expansion, and forest cover can 
expand strongly in 1.5°C and 2°C pathways alike compared to its 
extent in no-climate-policy baselines due to reduced deforestation and 
afforestation and reforestation measures. However, the extent to which 
forest cover expands varies highly across models in the literature, 
with some models projecting forest cover to stay virtually constant or 
decline slightly. This is due to whether afforestation and reforestation is 
included as a mitigation technology in these pathways and interactions 
with other sectors. 
As a consequence of other land-use changes, pasture land is generally 
projected to be reduced compared to both baselines in which no climate 
change mitigation action is undertaken and 2°C-consistent pathways. 
Furthermore, cropland for food and feed production decreases in 
most 1.5°C pathways, both compared to a no-climate baseline and 
relative to 2010. These reductions in agricultural land for food and feed 
production are facilitated by intensification on agricultural land and in 
livestock production systems (Popp et al., 2017), as well as changes 
in consumption patterns (Frank et al., 2017; Fujimori, 2017) (see 
145
2
Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.2 for an assessment of these mitigation 
options). For example, in a scenario based on rapid technological 
progress (Kriegler et al., 2017), global average cereal crop yields in 
2100 are assumed to be above 5 tDM ha−1 yr−1 in mitigation scenarios 
aiming at limiting end-of-century radiative forcing to 4.5 or 2.6 W m−2, 
compared to 4 tDM ha−1 yr−1 in the SSP5 baseline to ensure the same 
food production. Similar improvements are present in 1.5°C variants 
of such scenarios. Historically, cereal crop yields are estimated at 
1 tDM ha−1 yr−1 and about 3 tDM ha−1 yr−1 in 1965 and 2010, 
respectively (calculations based on FAOSTAT, 2018). For aggregate 
energy crops, models assume 4.2–8.9 tDM ha−1 yr−1 in 2010, increasing 
to about 6.9–17.4 tDM ha−1 yr−1 in 2050, which fall within the range 
found in the bottom-up literature yet depend on crop, climatic zone, 
land quality and plot size (Searle and Malins, 2014).
The pace of projected land transitions over the coming decades can 
differ strongly between 1.5°C and baseline scenarios without climate 
change mitigation and from historical trends (Table 2.9). However, 
there is uncertainty in the sign and magnitude of these future land-
use changes (Prestele et al., 2016; Popp et al., 2017; Doelman et al., 
2018). The pace of projected cropland changes overlaps with historical 
trends over the past four decades, but in several cases also goes well 
beyond this range. By the 2030–2050 period, the projected reductions 
in pasture and potentially strong increases in forest cover imply a 
reversed dynamic compared to historical and baseline trends. This 
suggests that distinct policy and government measures would be 
needed to achieve forest increases, particularly in a context of projected 
increased bioenergy use.
Changes in the AFOLU sector are driven by three main factors: demand 
changes, efficiency of production, and policy assumptions (Smith et 
al., 2013; Popp et al., 2017). Demand for agricultural products and 
other land-based commodities is influenced by consumption patterns 
(including dietary preferences and food waste affecting demand for 
food and feed) (Smith et al., 2013; van Vuuren et al., 2018), demand for 
forest products for pulp and construction (including less wood waste), 
and demand for biomass for energy production (Lambin and Meyfroidt, 
2011; Smith and Bustamante, 2014). Efficiency of agricultural and 
forestry production relates to improvements in agricultural and forestry 
practices (including product cascades, by-products and more waste- and 
residue-based biomass for energy production), agricultural and forestry 
yield increases, and intensification of livestock production systems 
leading to higher feed efficiency and changes in feed composition 
(Havlík et al., 2014; Weindl et al., 2015). Policy assumptions relate to 
the level of land protection, the treatment of food waste, policy choices 
about the timing of mitigation action (early vs late), the choice and 
Figure 2.24 |  Overview of land-use change transitions in 2030 and 2050, relative to 2010 based on pathways based on the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) (Popp et 
al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018). Grey: no-climate-policy baseline; green: 2.6 W m−2 pathways; blue: 1.9 W m−2 pathways. Pink: 1.9 W m−2 pathways grouped per 
underlying socio-economic assumption (from left to right: SSP1 sustainability, SSP2 middle-of-the-road, SSP5 fossil-fuelled development). Ranges show the minimum–maximum 
range across the SSPs. Single pathways are shown with plus signs. Illustrative archetype pathways are highlighted with distinct icons. Each panel shows the changes for a different 
land type. The 1.9 and 2.6 W m−2 pathways are taken as proxies for 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, respectively. The 2.6 W m−2 pathways are mostly consistent with the Lower-2°C and 
Higher-2°C pathway classes. The 1.9 W m−2 pathways are consistent with the 1.5°C-low-OS (mostly SSP1 and SSP2) and 1.5°C-high-OS (SSP5) pathway classes. In 2010, pasture 
was estimated to cover about 3–3.5 103 Mha, food and feed crops about 1.5–1.6 103 Mha, energy crops about 0–14 Mha and forest about 3.7–4.2 103 Mha, across the models 
that reported SSP pathways (Popp et al., 2017). When considering pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the full set of scenarios shows a conversion 
of 50–1100 Mha of pasture into 0–600 Mha for energy crops, a 200 Mha reduction to 950 Mha increase forest, and a 400 Mha decrease to a 250 Mha increase in non-pasture 
agricultural land for food and feed crops by 2050 relative to 2010. The large range across the literature and the understanding of the variations across models and assumptions 
leads to medium confidence in the size of these ranges.

preference of land-based mitigation options (for example, the inclusion 
of afforestation and reforestation as mitigation options), interactions 
with other sectors (Popp et al., 2017), and trade (Schmitz et al., 2012; 
Wiebe et al., 2015).
A global study (Stevanović et al., 2017) reported similar GHG reduction 
potentials for both production-side (agricultural production measures 
in combination with reduced deforestation) and consumption-side 
(diet change in combination with lower shares of food waste) measures 
on the order of 40% in 210011 (compared to a baseline scenario 
without land-based mitigation). Lower consumption of livestock 
products by 2050 could also substantially reduce deforestation and 
cumulative carbon losses (Weindl et al., 2017). On the supply side, 
minor productivity growth in extensive livestock production systems 
is projected to lead to substantial CO2 emission abatement, but the 
emission-saving potential of productivity gains in intensive systems is 
limited, mainly due to trade-offs with soil carbon stocks (Weindl et al., 
2017). In addition, even within existing livestock production systems, a 
transition from extensive to more productive systems bears substantial 
GHG abatement potential, while improving food availability (Gerber et 
al., 2013; Havlík et al., 2014). Many studies highlight the capability of 
agricultural intensification for reducing GHG emissions in the AFOLU 
sector or even enhancing terrestrial carbon stocks (Valin et al., 2013; 
Popp et al., 2014a; Wise et al., 2014). Also the importance of immediate 
and global land-use regulations for a comprehensive reduction of

All values in Mha yr−1. The 2.6 W m−2 pathways are mostly consistent with the Lower-2°C and Higher-2°C pathway classes. The 1.9 W m−2 pathways are  
 
broadly consistent with the 1.5°C-low-OS (mostly SSP1 and SSP2) and 1.5°C-high-OS (SSP5) pathway classes. Baseline projections reflect land-use developments  
 
projected by integrated assessment models under the assumptions of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) in absence of climate policies (Popp et al., 2017;  
 
Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018). Values give the full range across SSP scenarios. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  
 
(FAOSTAT, 2018), 4.9 billion hectares (approximately 40% of the land surface) was under agricultural use in 2005, either as cropland (1.5 billion hectares) or  
 
pasture (3.4 billion hectares). FAO data in the table are equally from FAOSTAT (2018).
land-related GHG emissions (especially related to deforestation) 
has been shown by several studies (Calvin et al., 2017; Fricko et al., 
2017; Fujimori, 2017). Ultimately, there are also interactions between 
these three factors and the wider society and economy, for example, 
if CDR technologies that are not land-based are deployed (like direct 
air capture – DACCS, see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7) or if other sectors 
over- or underachieve their projected mitigation contributions (Clarke 
et al., 2014). Variations in these drivers can lead to drastically different 
land-use implications (Popp et al., 2014b) (Figure 2.24).
Stringent mitigation pathways inform general GHG dynamics in 
the AFOLU sector. First, CO2 emissions from deforestation can be 
abated at relatively low carbon prices if displacement effects in 
other regions (Calvin et al., 2017) or other land-use types with high 
carbon density (Calvin et al., 2014; Popp et al., 2014a; Kriegler et 
al., 2017) can be avoided. However, efficiency and costs of reducing 
rates of deforestation strongly depend on governance performance, 
institutions and macroeconomic factors (Wang et al., 2016). Secondly, 
besides CO2 reductions, the land system can play an important role 
for overall CDR efforts (Rogelj et al., 2018) via BECCS, afforestation 
and reforestation, or a combination of options. The AFOLU sector also 
provides further potential for active terrestrial carbon sequestration, 
for example, via land restoration, improved management of forest and 
agricultural land (Griscom et al., 2017), or biochar applications (Smith, 
2016) (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.3.7). These options have so far 
11 Land-based mitigation options on the supply and the demand side are assessed in 4.3.2, and CDR options with a land component in 4.3.7. Chapter 5 (Section 5.4) assesses 
the implications of land-based mitigation for related SDGs, e.g., food security.

not been extensively integrated in the mitigation pathway literature 
(see Supplementary Material  2.SM.1.2), but in theory their availability 
would impact the deployment of other CDR technologies, like BECCS 
(Section 2.3.4) (Strefler et al., 2018a). These interactions will be 
discussed further in the SRCCL.
Residual agricultural non-CO2 emissions of CH4 and N2O play an 
important role for temperature stabilization pathways, and their relative 
importance increases in stringent mitigation pathways in which CO2 is 
reduced to net zero emissions globally (Gernaat et al., 2015; Popp et al., 
2017; Stevanović et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018), for example, through 
their impact on the remaining carbon budget (Section 2.2). Although 
agricultural non-CO2 emissions show marked reduction potentials 
in 2°C-consistent pathways, complete elimination of these emission 
sources does not occur in IAMs based on the evolution of agricultural 
practice assumed in integrated models (Figure 2.25) (Gernaat et al., 
2015). Methane emissions in 1.5°C pathways are reduced through 
improved agricultural management (e.g., improved management of 
water in rice production, manure and herds, and better livestock quality 
through breeding and improved feeding practices) as well as dietary 
shifts away from emissions-intensive livestock products. Similarly, 
N2O emissions decrease due to improved N-efficiency and manure 
management (Frank et al., 2018). However, high levels of bioenergy 
production can also result in increased N2O emissions (Kriegler et 
al., 2017), highlighting the importance of appropriate management 
approaches (Davis et al., 2013). Residual agricultural emissions can be 
further reduced by limiting demand for GHG-intensive foods through 
shifts to healthier and more sustainable diets (Tilman and Clark, 2014; 
Erb et al., 2016b; Springmann et al., 2016) and reductions in food waste 
(Bajželj et al., 2014; Muller et al., 2017; Popp et al., 2017) (see also 
Chapter 4 and SRCCL). Finally, several mitigation measures that could 
affect these agricultural non-CO2 emissions are not, or only to a limited 
degree, considered in the current integrated pathway literature (see 
Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.2). Such measures (like plant-based 
and synthetic proteins, methane inhibitors and vaccines in livestock, 
alternate wetting and drying in paddy rice, or nitrification inhibitors) 
are very diverse and differ in their development or deployment stages. 
Their potentials have not been explicitly assessed here.
Pathways consistent with 1.5°C rely on one or more of the three 
strategies highlighted above (demand changes, efficiency gains, and 
policy assumptions), and can apply these in different configurations. 
For example, among the four illustrative archetypes used in this 
chapter (Section 2.1), the LED and S1 pathways focus on generally 
low resource and energy consumption (including healthy diets with 
low animal-calorie shares and low food waste) as well as significant 
agricultural intensification in combination with high levels of nature 
protection. Under such assumptions, comparably small amounts of 
land are needed for land-demanding mitigation activities such as 
BECCS and afforestation and reforestation, leaving the land footprint 
for energy crops in 2050 virtually the same compared to 2010 levels for 
the LED pathway. In contrast, future land-use developments can look 
very different under the resource- and energy-intensive S5 pathway 
that includes less healthy diets with high animal shares and high 
shares of food waste (Tilman and Clark, 2014; Springmann et al., 2016) 
combined with a strong orientation towards technology solutions to 
compensate for high reliance on fossil-fuel resources and associated 
high levels of GHG emissions in the baseline. In such pathways, climate 
change mitigation strategies strongly depend on the availability of 
CDR through BECCS (Humpenöder et al., 2014). As a consequence, the 
S5 pathway sources significant amounts of biomass through bioenergy 
crop expansion in combination with agricultural intensification. Also, 
further policy assumptions can strongly affect land-use developments, 
highlighting the importance for land use of making appropriate 
policy choices. For example, within the SSP set, some pathways rely 
strongly on a policy to incentivize afforestation and reforestation for 
CDR together with BECCS, which results in an expansion of forest area 
and a corresponding increase in terrestrial carbon stock. Finally, the 
variety of pathways illustrates how policy choices in the AFOLU and 
other sectors strongly affect land-use developments and associated 
sustainable development interactions (Chapter 5, Section 5.4) in 1.5°C 
pathways.
The choice of strategy or mitigation portfolio impacts the GHG 
dynamics of the land system and other sectors (see Section 2.3), as well 
as the synergies and trade-offs with other environmental and societal 
objectives (see Section 2.5.3 and Chapter 5, Section 5.4). For example, 
AFOLU developments in 1.5°C pathways range from strategies 
that differ by almost an order of magnitude in their projected land 
requirements for bioenergy (Figure 2.24), and some strategies would 
allow an increase in forest cover over the 21st century compared to 
strategies under which forest cover remains approximately constant.

High agricultural yields and application of intensified animal husbandry, 
implementation of best-available technologies for reducing non-CO2 
emissions, or lifestyle changes including a less-meat-intensive diet and 
less CO2-intensive transport modes, have been identified as allowing 
for such a forest expansion and reduced footprints from bioenergy 
without compromising food security (Frank et al., 2017; Doelman et al., 
2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018). 
The IAMs used in the pathways underlying this assessment (Popp 
et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018) do not include all 
potential land-based mitigation options and side-effects, and their 
results are hence subject to uncertainty. For example, recent research 
has highlighted the potential impact of forest management practices 
on land carbon content (Erb et al., 2016a; Naudts et al., 2016) and 
the uncertainty surrounding future crop yields (Haberl et al., 2013; 
Searle and Malins, 2014) and water availability (Liu et al., 2014). 
These aspects are included in IAMs in varying degrees but were not 
assessed in this report. Furthermore, land-use modules of some IAMs 
can depict spatially resolved climate damages to agriculture (Nelson et 
al., 2014), but this option was not used in the SSP quantifications (Riahi 
et al., 2017). Damages (e.g., due to ozone exposure or varying indirect 
fertilization due to atmospheric N and Fe deposition (e.g., Shindell et 
al., 2012; Mahowald et al., 2017) are also not included. Finally, this 
assessment did not look into the literature of agricultural sector models 
which could provide important additional detail and granularity to the 
discussion presented here.12  This limits their ability to capture the full 
mitigation potentials and benefits between scenarios. An in-depth 
assessment of these aspects lies outside the scope of this Special 
Report. However, their existence affects the confidence assessment of 
the AFOLU transition in 1.5°C pathways. 
Despite the limitations of current modelling approaches, there is high 
agreement and robust evidence across models and studies that the 
AFOLU sector plays an important role in stringent mitigation pathways. 
The findings from these multiple lines of evidence also result in high 
confidence that AFOLU mitigation strategies can vary significantly 
based on preferences and policy choices, facilitating the exploration of 
strategies that can achieve multiple societal objectives simultaneously 
(see also Section 2.5.3). At the same time, given the many uncertainties 
and limitations, only low to medium confidence can be attributed by 
this assessment to the more extreme AFOLU developments found in 
the pathway literature, and low to medium confidence to the level of 
residual non-CO2 emissions.
2.5 
Challenges, Opportunities and Co-Impacts 
of Transformative Mitigation Pathways
This section examines aspects other than climate outcomes of 1.5°C 
mitigation pathways. Focus is given to challenges and opportunities 
related to policy regimes, price of carbon and co-impacts, including 
sustainable development issues, which can be derived from the existing 
integrated pathway literature. Attention is also given to uncertainties 
and critical assumptions underpinning mitigation pathways. The

challenges and opportunities identified in this section are further 
elaborated Chapter 4 (e.g., policy choice and implementation) and 
Chapter 5 (e.g., sustainable development). The assessment indicates 
unprecedented policy and geopolitical challenges.
2.5.1 
Policy Frameworks and Enabling Conditions
Moving from a 2°C to a 1.5°C pathway implies bold integrated policies 
that enable higher socio-technical transition speeds, larger deployment 
scales, and the phase-out of existing systems that may lock in 
emissions for decades (high confidence) (Geels et al., 2017; Kuramochi 
et al., 2017; Rockström et al., 2017; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2017; 
Kriegler et al., 2018a; Michaelowa et al., 2018). This requires higher 
levels of transformative policy regimes in the near term, which allow 
deep decarbonization pathways to emerge and a net zero carbon 
energy–economy system to emerge in the 2040–2060 period (Rogelj 
et al., 2015b; Bataille et al., 2016b). This enables accelerated levels 
of technological deployment and innovation (Geels et al., 2017; IEA, 
2017a; Grubler et al., 2018) and assumes more profound behavioural, 
economic and political transformation (Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 4.4). 
Despite inherent levels of uncertainty attached to modelling studies 
(e.g., related to climate and carbon cycle response), studies stress the 
urgency for transformative policy efforts to reduce emissions in the 
short term (Riahi et al., 2015; Kuramochi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 
2018).
The available literature indicates that mitigation pathways in line 
with 1.5°C pathways would require stringent and integrated policy 
interventions (very high confidence). Higher policy ambition often 
takes the form of stringent economy-wide emission targets (and 
resulting peak-and-decline of emissions), larger coverage of NDCs to 
more gases and sectors (e.g., land-use, international aviation), much 
lower energy and carbon intensity rates than historically seen, carbon 
prices much higher than the ones observed in real markets, increased 
climate finance, global coordinated policy action, and implementation 
of additional initiatives (e.g., by non-state actors) (Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 
2.5.2). The diversity (beyond explicit carbon pricing) and effectiveness 
of policy portfolios are of prime importance, particularly in the short-
term (Mundaca and Markandya, 2016; Kuramochi et al., 2017; OECD, 
2017; Kriegler et al., 2018a; Michaelowa et al., 2018). For instance, 
deep decarbonization pathways in line with a 2˚C target (covering 
74% of global energy-system emissions) include a mix of stringent 
regulation (e.g., building codes, minimum performance standards), 
carbon pricing mechanisms and R&D (research and development) 
innovation policies (Bataille et al., 2016a). Explicit carbon pricing, 
direct regulation and public investment to enable innovation are 
critical for deep decarbonization pathways (Grubb et al., 2014). 
Effective planning (including compact city measures) and integrated 
regulatory frameworks are also key drivers in the IEA-ETP B2DS study 
for the transport sector (IEA, 2017a). Effective urban planning can 
reduce GHG emissions from urban transport between 20% and 50% 
(Creutzig, 2016). Comprehensive policy frameworks would be needed 
if the decarbonization of the power system is pursued while increasing 
end-use electrification (including transport) (IEA, 2017a). Technology 
policies (e.g., feed-in-tariffs), financing instruments, carbon pricing 
149

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
and system integration management driving the rapid adoption of 
renewable energy technologies are critical for the decarbonization 
of electricity generation (Bruckner et al., 2014; Luderer et al., 2014; 
Creutzig et al., 2017; Pietzcker et al., 2017). Likewise, low-carbon and 
resilient investments are facilitated by a mix of coherent policies, 
including fiscal and structural reforms (e.g., labour markets), public 
procurement, carbon pricing, stringent standards, information schemes, 
technology policies, fossil-fuel subsidy removal, climate risk disclosure, 
and land-use and transport planning (OECD, 2017). Pathways in which 
CDR options are restricted emphasize the strengthening of near-term 
policy mixes (Luderer et al., 2013; Kriegler et al., 2018a). Together with 
the decarbonization of the supply side, ambitious policies targeting 
fuel switching and energy efficiency improvements on the demand 
side play a major role across mitigation pathways (Clarke et al., 2014; 
Kriegler et al., 2014b; Riahi et al., 2015; Kuramochi et al., 2017; Brown 
and Li, 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; Wachsmuth and Duscha, 2018). 
The combined evidence suggests that aggressive policies addressing 
energy efficiency are central in keeping 1.5°C within reach and lowering 
energy system and mitigation costs (high confidence) (Luderer et al., 
2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b, 2015b; Grubler et al., 2018). Demand-side 
policies that increase energy efficiency or limit energy demand at a 
higher rate than historically observed are critical enabling factors for 
reducing mitigation costs in stringent mitigation pathways across the 
board (Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b, 2015b; Clarke et al., 
2014; Bertram et al., 2015a; Bataille et al., 2016b). Ambitious sector-
specific mitigation policies in industry, transportation and residential 
sectors are needed in the short run for emissions to peak in 2030 
(Méjean et al., 2018). Stringent demand-side policies (e.g., tightened 
efficiency standards for buildings and appliances) driving the expansion, 
efficiency and provision of high-quality energy services are essential 
to meet a 1.5˚C mitigation target while reducing the reliance on CDR 
(Grubler et al., 2018). A 1.5˚C pathway for the transport sector is possible 
using a mix of additional and stringent policy actions preventing (or 
reducing) the need for transport, encouraging shifts towards efficient 
modes of transport, and improving vehicle-fuel efficiency (Gota et al., 
2018). Stringent demand-side policies also reduce the need for CCS 
(Wachsmuth and Duscha, 2018). Even in the presence of weak near 
term policy frameworks, increased energy efficiency lowers mitigation 
costs noticeably compared to pathways with reference energy intensity 
(Bertram et al., 2015a). Common issues in the literature relate to the 
rebound effect, the potential overestimation of the effectiveness 
of energy efficiency policy, and policies to counteract the rebound 
(Saunders, 2015; van den Bergh, 2017; Grubler et al., 2018) (Sections 
2.4 and 4.4).
SSP-based modelling studies underline that socio-economic and 
climate policy assumptions strongly influence mitigation pathway 
characteristics and the economics of achieving a specific climate 
target (very high confidence) (Bauer et al., 2017; Guivarch and Rogelj, 
2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018). SSP assumptions related 
to economic growth and energy intensity are critical determinants 
of projected CO2 emissions (Marangoni et al., 2017). A multimodel 
inter-comparison study found that mitigation challenges in line with 
a 1.5˚C target vary substantially across SSPs and policy assumptions 
(Rogelj et al., 2018). Under SSP1-SPA1 (sustainability) and SSP2-SPA2 
(middle-of-the-road), the majority of IAMs were capable of producing 
1.5˚C pathways. On the contrary, none of the IAMs contained in the 
SR1.5 database could produce a 1.5°C pathway under SSP3-SPA3 
assumptions. Preventing elements include, for instance, climate 
policy fragmentation, limited control of land-use emissions, heavy 
reliance on fossil fuels, unsustainable consumption and marked 
inequalities (Rogelj et al., 2018). Dietary aspects of the SSPs are also 
critical: climate-friendly diets were contained in ‘sustainability’ (SSP1) 
and meat-intensive diets in SSP3 and SSP5 (Popp et al., 2017). CDR 
requirements are reduced under ‘sustainability’ related assumptions 
(Strefler et al., 2018b). These are major policy-related reasons for why 
SSP1-SPA1 translates into relatively low mitigation challenges whereas 
SSP3-SPA3 and SSP5-SPA5 entail futures that pose the highest socio-
technical and economic challenges. SSPs/SPAs assumptions indicate 
that policy-driven pathways that encompass accelerated change away 
from fossil fuels, large-scale deployment of low-carbon energy supplies, 
improved energy efficiency and sustainable consumption lifestyles 
reduce the risks of climate targets becoming unreachable (Clarke et 
al., 2014; Riahi et al., 2015, 2017; Marangoni et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 
2017, 2018; Strefler et al., 2018b).
Policy assumptions that lead to weak or delayed mitigation action from 
what would be possible in a fully cooperative world strongly influence 
the achievability of mitigation targets (high confidence) (Luderer et al., 
2013; Rogelj et al., 2013b; OECD, 2017; Holz et al., 2018a; Strefler et al., 
2018b). Such regimes also include current NDCs (Fawcett et al., 2015; 
Aldy et al., 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016a, 2017; Hof et al., 2017; van Soest et 
al., 2017), which have been reported to make achieving a 2°C pathway 
unattainable without CDR (Strefler et al., 2018b). Not strengthening 
NDCs would make it very challenging to keep 1.5°C within reach (see 
Section 2.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4). One multimodel 
inter-comparison study (Luderer et al., 2016b, 2018) explored the effects 
on 1.5°C pathways assuming the implementation of current NDCs 
until 2030 and stringent reductions thereafter. It finds that delays in 
globally coordinated actions lead to various models reaching no 1.5°C 
pathways during the 21st century. Transnational emission reduction 
initiatives (TERIs) outside the UNFCCC have also been assessed and 
found to overlap (70–80%) with NDCs and be inadequate to bridge 
the gap between NDCs and a 2°C pathway (Roelfsema et al., 2018). 
Weak and fragmented short-term policy efforts use up a large share of 
the long-term carbon budget before 2030–2050 (Bertram et al., 2015a; 
van Vuuren et al., 2016) and increase the need for the full portfolio 
of mitigation measures, including CDR (Clarke et al., 2014; Riahi 
et al., 2015; Xu and Ramanathan, 2017). Furthermore, fragmented 
policy scenarios also exhibit ‘carbon leakage’ via energy and capital 
markets (Arroyo-Currás et al., 2015; Kriegler et al., 2015b). A lack of 
integrated policy portfolios can increase the risks of trade-offs between 
mitigation approaches and sustainable development objectives (see 
Sections 2.5.3 and 5.4). However, more detailed analysis is needed 
about realistic (less disruptive) policy trajectories until 2030 that can 
strengthen near-term mitigation action and meaningfully decrease 
post-2030 challenges (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4).
Whereas the policy frameworks and enabling conditions identified 
above pertain to the ‘idealized’ dimension of mitigation pathways, 
aspects related to 1.5°C mitigation pathways in practice are of prime 
importance. For example, issues related to second-best stringency 
levels, international cooperation, public acceptance, distributional 
150

consequences, multilevel governance, non-state actions, compliance 
levels, capacity building, rebound effects, linkages across highly 
heterogeneous policies, sustained behavioural change, finance and 
intra- and inter-generational issues need to be considered (see Chapter 
4, Section 4.4) (Bataille et al., 2016a; Mundaca and Markandya, 2016; 
Baranzini et al., 2017; MacDougall et al., 2017; van den Bergh, 2017; 
Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte, 2017; Chan et al., 2018; Holz et al., 2018a; 
Klinsky and Winkler, 2018; Michaelowa et al., 2018; Patterson et al., 
2018). Furthermore, policies interact with a wide portfolio of pre-
existing policy instruments that address multiple areas (e.g., technology 
markets, economic growth, poverty alleviation, climate adaptation) and 
deal with various market failures (e.g., information asymmetries) and 
behavioural aspects (e.g., heuristics) that prevent or hinder mitigation 
actions (Kolstad et al., 2014; Mehling and Tvinnereim, 2018). The socio-
technical transition literature points to multiple complexities in real-
world settings that prevent reaching ‘idealized’ policy conditions but 
at the same time can still accelerate transformative change through 
other co-evolutionary processes of technology and society (Geels et 
al., 2017; Rockström et al., 2017). Such co-processes are complex and 
go beyond the role of policy (including carbon pricing) and comprise 
the role of citizens, businesses, stakeholder groups or governments, 
as well as the interplay of institutional and socio-political dimensions 
(Michaelowa et al., 2018; Veland et al., 2018). It is argued that large 
system transformations, similar to those in 1.5°C pathways, require 
prioritizing an evolutionary and behavioural framework in economic 
theory rather than an optimization or equilibrium framework as is 
common in current IAMs (Grubb et al., 2014; Patt, 2017). Accumulated 
know-how, accelerated innovation and public investment play a key 
role in (rapid) transitions (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4) (Geels et al., 2017; 
Michaelowa et al., 2018).
In summary, the emerging literature supports the AR5 on the need for 
integrated, robust and stringent policy frameworks targeting both the 
supply and demand-side of energy-economy systems (high confidence). 
Continuous ex-ante policy assessments provide learning opportunities 
for both policy makers and stakeholders.

Two approaches have been commonly used to assess alternative emissions pathways: cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and 
cost–benefit analysis (CBA). CEA aims at identifying emissions pathways minimising the total mitigation costs of achieving 
a given warming or GHG limit (Clarke et al., 2014). CBA has the goal to identify the optimal emissions trajectory minimising the 
discounted flows of abatement expenditures and monetized climate change damages (Boardman et al., 2006; Stern, 2007). A third 
concept, the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) measures the total net damages of an extra metric ton of CO2 emissions due to the 
associated climate change (Nordhaus, 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Rose et al., 2017a). Negative and positive impacts are monetized, 
discounted and the net value is expressed as an equivalent loss of consumption today. The SCC can be evaluated for any emissions 
pathway under policy consideration (Rose, 2012; NASEM, 2016, 2017). 
Along the optimal trajectory determined by CBA, the SCC equals the discounted value of the marginal abatement cost of a metric ton 
of CO2 emissions. Equating the present value of future damages and marginal abatement costs includes a number of critical value 
judgements in the formulation of the social welfare function (SWF), particularly in how non-market damages and the distribution of 
damages across countries and individuals and between current and future generations are valued (Kolstad et al., 2014). For example, 
since climate damages accrue to a larger extent farther in the future and can persist for many years, assumptions and approaches 
to determine the social discount rate (normative ‘prescriptive’ vs. positive ‘descriptive’) and social welfare function (e.g., discounted 
utilitarian SWF vs. undiscounted prioritarian SWF) can heavily influence CBA outcomes and associated estimates of SCC (Kolstad et 
al., 2014; Pizer et al., 2014; Adler and Treich, 2015; Adler et al., 2017; NASEM, 2017; Nordhaus, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a).
In CEA, the marginal abatement cost of carbon is determined by the climate goal under consideration. It equals the shadow price 
of carbon associated with the goal which in turn can be interpreted as the willingness to pay for imposing the goal as a political 
constraint. Emissions prices are usually expressed in carbon (equivalent) prices using the GWP-100 metric as the exchange rate 
for pricing emissions of non-CO2 GHGs controlled under internationally climate agreements (like CH4, N2O and fluorinated gases, 
see Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1).13  Since policy goals like the goals of limiting warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C do not 
directly result from a money metric trade-off between mitigation and damages, associated shadow prices can differ from the SCC in 
a CBA. In CEA, value judgments are to a large extent concentrated in the choice of climate goal and related implications, while more 
explicit assumptions about social values are required to perform CBA. For example, in CEA assumptions about the social discount 
rate no longer affect the overall abatement levels now set by the climate goal, but the choice and timing of investments in individual 
measures to reach these levels.
13 Also other metrics to compare emissions have been suggested and adopted by governments nationally (Kandlikar, 1995; Marten et al., 2015; Shindell, 2015; IWG, 2016).

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
Although CBA-based and CEA-based assessment are both subject to large uncertainty about socio-techno-economic trends, policy 
developments and climate response, the range of estimates for the SCC along an optimal trajectory determined by CBA is far wider 
than for estimates of the shadow price of carbon in CEA-based approaches. In CBA, the value judgments about inter- and intra-
generational equity combined with uncertainties in the climate damage functions assumed, including their empirical basis, are 
important (Pindyck, 2013; Stern, 2013; Revesz et al., 2014). In a CEA-based approach, the value judgments about the aggregate 
welfare function matter less, and uncertainty about climate response and impacts can be tied into various climate targets and 
related emissions budgets (Clarke et al., 2014).
The CEA- and CBA-based carbon cost estimates are derived with a different set of tools. They are all summarised as integrated 
assessment models (IAMs) but in fact are of very different nature (Weyant, 2017). Detailed process IAMs such as AIM (Fujimori, 
2017), GCAM (Thomson et al., 2011; Calvin et al., 2017), IMAGE (van Vuuren et al., 2011b, 2017b), MESSAGE-GLOBIOM (Riahi 
et al., 2011; Havlík et al., 2014; Fricko et al., 2017), REMIND-MAgPIE (Popp et al., 2010; Luderer et al., 2013; Kriegler et al., 2017) 
and WITCH (Bosetti et al., 2006, 2008, 2009) include a process-based representation of energy and land systems, but in most 
cases lack a comprehensive representation of climate damages, and are typically used for CEA. Diagnostic analyses across CBA-
IAMs indicate important dissimilarities in modelling assembly, implementation issues and behaviour (e.g., parametric uncertainty, 
damage responses, income sensitivity) that need to be recognized to better understand SCC estimates (Rose et al., 2017a). 
CBA-IAMs such as DICE (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000; Nordhaus, 2013, 2017), PAGE (Hope, 2006) and FUND (Tol, 1999; Anthoff and 
Tol, 2009) attempt to capture the full feedback from climate response to socio-economic damages in an aggregated manner, but are 
usually much more stylised than detailed process IAMs. In a nutshell, the methodological framework for estimating SCC involves 
projections of population growth, economic activity and resulting emissions; computations of atmospheric composition and global 
mean temperatures as a result of emissions; estimations of physical impacts of climate changes; monetization of impacts (positive 
and negative) on human welfare; and the discounting of the future monetary value of impacts to year of emission (Kolstad et al., 
2014; Revesz et al., 2014; NASEM, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a). There has been a discussion in the literature to what extent CBA-
IAMs underestimate the SCC due to, for example, a limited treatment or difficulties in addressing damages to human well-being, 
labour productivity, value of capital stock, ecosystem services and the risks of catastrophic climate change for future generations 
(Ackerman and Stanton, 2012; Revesz et al., 2014; Moore and Diaz, 2015; Stern, 2016). However, there has been progress in ‘bottom-
up’ empirical analyses of climate damages (Hsiang et al., 2017), the insights of which could be integrated into these models (Dell et 
al., 2014). Most of the models used in Chapter 2 on 1.5°C mitigation pathways are detailed process IAMs and thus deal with CEA. 
An important question is how results from CEA- and CBA-type approaches can be compared and synthesized. Such synthesis needs 
to be done with care, since estimates of the shadow price of carbon under the climate goal and SCC estimates from CBA might not 
be directly comparable due to different tools, approaches and assumptions used to derive them. Acknowledging this caveat, the 
SCC literature has identified a range of factors, assumptions and value judgements that support SCC values above $100 tCO2
−1 that 
are also found as net present values of the shadow price of carbon in 1.5°C pathways. These factors include accounting for tipping 
points in the climate system (Lemoine and Traeger, 2014; Cai et al., 2015; Lontzek et al., 2015), a low social discount rate (Nordhaus, 
2007a; Stern, 2007) and inequality aversion (Schmidt et al., 2013; Dennig et al., 2015; Adler et al., 2017). 
The SCC and the shadow price of carbon are not merely theoretical concepts but used in regulation (Pizer et al., 2014; Revesz et al., 
2014; Stiglitz et al., 2017). As stated by the report of the High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing (Stiglitz et al., 2017), in the real 
world there is a distinction to be made between the implementable and efficient explicit carbon prices and the implicit (notional) 
carbon prices to be retained for policy appraisal and the evaluation of public investments, as is already done in some jurisdictions 
such as the USA, UK and France. Since 2008, the U.S. government has used SCC estimates to assess the benefits and costs related 
to CO2 emissions resulting from federal policymaking (NASEM, 2017; Rose et al., 2017a).
The use of the SCC for policy appraisals is, however, not straightforward in an SDG context. There are suggestions that a broader 
range of polluting activities than only CO2 emissions, for example emissions of air pollutants, and a broader range of impacts 
than only climate change, such as impacts on air quality, health and sustainable development in general (see Chapter 5 for a 
detailed discussion), would need to be included in social costs (Sarofim et al., 2017; Shindell et al., 2017a). Most importantly, 
a consistent valuation of the SCC in a sustainable development framework would require accounting for the SDGs in the social 
welfare formulation (see Chapter 5).

Economic and Investment Implications of 1.5°C 
Pathways
2.5.2.1 Price of carbon emissions
The price of carbon assessed here is fundamentally different from the 
concepts of optimal carbon price in a cost–benefit analysis, or the social 
cost of carbon (see Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter and Chapter 
3, Section 3.5.2). Under a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) modelling 
framework, prices for carbon (mitigation costs) reflect the stringency of 
mitigation requirements at the margin (i.e., cost of mitigating one extra 
unit of emission). Explicit carbon pricing is briefly addressed here to the 
extent it pertains to the scope of Chapter 2. For detailed policy issues 
about carbon pricing see Section 4.4.5.
Based on data available for this special report, the price of carbon 
varies substantially across models and scenarios, and their values 
increase with mitigation efforts (see Figure 2.26) (high confidence). 
For instance, undiscounted values under a Higher-2°C pathway range 
from 15–220 USD2010 tCO2-eq
−1 in 2030, 45–1050 USD2010 tCO2-eq
−1 
in 2050, 120–1100 USD2010 tCO2-eq
−1 in 2070 and 175–2340 USD2010 
tCO2-eq
−1 in 2100. On the contrary, estimates for a Below-1.5°C 
pathway range from 135–6050 USD2010 tCO2-eq
−1 in 2030, 245–14300 
USD2010 tCO2-eq
−1 in 2050, 420–19300 USD2010 tCO2-eq
−1 in 2070 
and 690–30100 USD2010 tCO2-eq
−1 in 2100. Values for 1.5°C-low-OS 
pathway are relatively higher than 1.5°C-high-OS pathway in 2030, 
but the difference decreases over time, particularly between 2050 and 
2070. This is because in 1.5°C-high-OS pathways there is relatively 
less mitigation activity in the first half of the century, but more in 
the second half. The low energy demand (LED, P1 in the Summary for 
Policymakers) scenario exhibits the lowest values across the illustrative 
pathway archetypes. As a whole, the global average discounted price 
of emissions across 1.5°C- and 2°C pathways differs by a factor of 
four across models (assuming a 5% annual discount rate, comparing to 
Below-1.5°C and 1.5°C-low-OS pathways). If 1.5°C-high-OS pathways 
(with peak warming 0.1–0.4°C higher than 1.5°C) or pathways with 
very large land-use sinks are also considered, the differential value is 
reduced to a limited degree, from a factor 4 to a factor 3. The increase 
in mitigation costs between 1.5°C and 2°C pathways is based on a 
direct comparison of pathway pairs from the same model and the 
same study in which the 1.5°C pathway assumes a significantly smaller 
carbon budget compared to the 2°C pathway (e.g., 600 GtCO2 smaller 
in the CD-LINKS and ADVANCE studies). This assumption is the main 
driver behind the increase in the price of carbon (Luderer et al., 2018; 
McCollum et al., 2018).14
The wide range of values depends on numerous aspects, including 
methodologies, projected energy service demands, mitigation targets, 
fuel prices and technology availability (high confidence) (Clarke et al., 
2014; Kriegler et al., 2015b; Rogelj et al., 2015c; Riahi et al., 2017; 
Stiglitz et al., 2017). The characteristics of the technology portfolio, 
particularly in terms of investment costs and deployment rates, play a 
key role (Luderer et al., 2013, 2016a; Clarke et al., 2014; Bertram et al., 
2015a; Riahi et al., 2015; Rogelj et al., 2015c). Models that encompass 
a higher degree of technology granularity and that entail more 
flexibility regarding mitigation response often produce relatively lower 
mitigation costs than those that show less flexibility from a technology 
perspective (Bertram et al., 2015a; Kriegler et al., 2015a). Pathways 
providing high estimates often have limited flexibility of substituting 
fossil fuels with low-carbon technologies and the associated need 
to compensate fossil-fuel emissions with CDR. The price of carbon is 
also sensitive to the non-availability of BECCS (Bauer et al., 2018). 
Furthermore, and due to the treatment of future price anticipation, 
recursive-dynamic modelling approaches (with ‘myopic anticipation’) 
exhibit higher prices in the short term but modest increases in the long 
term compared to optimization modelling frameworks with ‘perfect 
foresight’ that show exponential pricing trajectories (Guivarch and 
Rogelj, 2017). The chosen social discount rate in CEA studies (range 
of 2–8% per year in the reported data, varying over time and sectors) 
can also affect the choice and timing of investments in mitigation 
measures (Clarke et al., 2014; Kriegler et al., 2015b; Weyant, 2017). 
However, the impacts of varying discount rates on 1.5°C (and 2°C) 
mitigation strategies can only be assessed to a limited degree. The 
above highlights the importance of sampling bias in pathway analysis 
ensembles towards outcomes derived from models which are more 
flexible, have more mitigation options and cheaper cost assumptions 
and thus can provide feasible pathways in contrast to other who are 
unable to do so (Tavoni and Tol, 2010; Clarke et al., 2014; Bertram et 
al., 2015a; Kriegler et al., 2015a; Guivarch and Rogelj, 2017). All CEA-
based IAM studies reveal no unique path for the price of emissions 
(Bertram et al., 2015a; Kriegler et al., 2015b; Akimoto et al., 2017; Riahi 
et al., 2017).
Socio-economic conditions and policy assumptions also influence the 
price of carbon (very high confidence) (Bauer et al., 2017; Guivarch and 
Rogelj, 2017; Hof et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018). A 
multimodel study (Riahi et al., 2017) estimated the average discounted 
price of carbon (2010–2100, 5% discount rate) for a 2°C target to 
be nearly three times higher in the SSP5 marker than in the SSP1 
marker. Another multimodel study (Rogelj et al., 2018) estimated the 
average discounted price of carbon (2020–2100, 5%) to be 35–65% 
lower in SSP1 compared to SSP2 in 1.5°C pathways. Delayed near-
term mitigation policies and measures, including the limited extent of 
international global cooperation, result in increases in total economic 
mitigation costs and corresponding prices of carbon (Luderer et al., 
2013; Clarke et al., 2014). This is because stronger efforts are required 
in the period after the delay to counterbalance the higher emissions 
in the near term. Staged accession scenarios also produce higher 
mitigation costs than immediate action mitigation scenarios under the 
same stringency level of emissions (Kriegler et al., 2015b). 
It has been long argued that an explicit carbon pricing mechanism 
(whether via a tax or cap-and-trade scheme) can theoretically achieve 
cost-effective emission reductions (Nordhaus, 2007b; Stern, 2007; 
Aldy and Stavins, 2012; Goulder and Schein, 2013; Somanthan et al., 
2014; Weitzman, 2014; Tol, 2017). Whereas the integrated assessment 
literature is mostly focused on the role of carbon pricing to reduce 
emissions (Clarke et al., 2014; Riahi et al., 2017; Weyant, 2017), there 
14 Unlike AR5, which only included cost-effective scenarios for estimating discounted average carbon prices for 2015–2100 (also using a 5% discount rate) (see Clarke et al., 
2014, p.450), please note that values shown in Figure 2.26b include delays or technology constraint cases (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3).

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development 
Chapter 2
is an emerging body of studies (including bottom-up approaches) that 
focuses on the interaction and performance of various policy mixes (e.g., 
regulation, subsidies, standards). Assuming global implementation of 
a mix of regionally existing best-practice policies (mostly regulatory 
policies in the electricity, industry, buildings, transport and agricultural 
sectors) and moderate carbon pricing (between 5–20 USD2010 tCO2
−1 
in 2025 in most world regions and average prices around 25 USD2010 
tCO2
−1 in 2030), early action mitigation pathways are generated that 
reduce global CO2 emissions by an additional 10 GtCO2e in 2030 
compared to the NDCs (Kriegler et al., 2018a) (see Section 2.3.5). 
Furthermore, a mix of stringent energy efficiency policies (e.g., minimum 
performance standards, building codes) combined with a carbon tax 
(rising from 10 USD2010 tCO2
−1 in 2020 to 27 USD2010 tCO2
−1 in 2040) 
is more cost-effective than a carbon tax alone (from 20 to 53 USD2010 
tCO2
−1) to generate a 1.5°C pathway for the U.S. electric sector (Brown 
and Li, 2018). Likewise, a policy mix encompassing a moderate carbon 
price (7 USD2010 tCO2
−1 in 2015) combined with a ban on new coal-
based power plants and dedicated policies addressing renewable 
electricity generation capacity and electric vehicles reduces efficiency 
losses compared with an optimal carbon pricing in 2030 (Bertram et al., 
2015b). One study estimates the carbon prices in high energy-intensive 
pathways to be 25–50% higher than in low energy-intensive pathways 
that assume ambitious regulatory instruments, economic incentives 
(in addition to a carbon price) and voluntary initiatives (Méjean et 
al., 2018). A bottom-up approach shows that stringent minimum 
performance standards (MEPS) for appliances (e.g., refrigerators) can 
effectively complement explicit carbon pricing, as tightened MEPS can 
achieve ambitious efficiency improvements that cannot be assured by 
carbon prices of 100 USD2010 tCO2
−1 or higher (Sonnenschein et al., 
2018). In addition, the revenue recycling effect of carbon pricing can 
reduce mitigation costs by displacing distortionary taxes (Baranzini et 
al., 2017; OECD, 2017; McFarland et al., 2018; Sands, 2018; Siegmeier 
et al., 2018), and the reduction of capital tax (compared to a labour 
tax) can yield greater savings in welfare costs (Sands, 2018). The effect 
on public budgets is particularly important in the near term; however, 
it can decline in the long term as carbon neutrality is achieved (Sands, 
2018). The literature indicates that explicit carbon pricing is relevant 
but needs to be complemented with other policies to drive the required 
changes in line with 1.5°C cost-effective pathways (low to medium 
evidence, high agreement) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4.5) (Stiglitz et al., 
2017; Mehling and Tvinnereim, 2018; Méjean et al., 2018; Michaelowa 
et al., 2018).
In summary, new analyses are consistent with AR5 and show 
that the price of carbon increases significantly if a higher level of 
stringency is pursued (high confidence). Values vary substantially 
across models, scenarios and socio-economic, technology and policy 
assumptions. While an explicit carbon pricing mechanism is central 
to prompt mitigation scenarios compatible with 1.5°C pathways, a 
complementary mix of stringent policies is required. 
2.5.2.2 Investments
Realizing the transformations towards a 1.5°C world would require a 
major shift in investment patterns (McCollum et al., 2018). Literature on 
global climate change mitigation investments is relatively sparse, with 
most detailed literature having focused on 2°C pathways (McCollum

pathways. Panels show (a) undiscounted price of carbon (2030–2100) and (b) average 
price of carbon (2030–2100) discounted at a 5% discount rate to 2020 in USD2010.

et al., 2013; Bowen et al., 2014; Gupta and Harnisch, 2014; Marangoni 
and Tavoni, 2014; OECD/IEA and IRENA, 2017). 
Global energy-system investments in the year 2016 are estimated at 
approximately 1.7 trillion USD2010 (approximately 2.2% of global GDP 
and 10% of gross capital formation), of which 0.23 trillion USD2010 
was for incremental end-use energy efficiency and the remainder for 
supply-side capacity installations (IEA, 2017c). There is some uncertainty 
surrounding this number because not all entities making investments 
report them publicly, and model-based estimates show an uncertainty 
range of about ±15% (McCollum et al., 2018). Notwithstanding, the 
trend for global energy investments has been generally upward over 
the last two decades: increasing about threefold between 2000 and 
2012, then levelling off for three years before declining in both 2015 
and 2016 as a result of the oil price collapse and simultaneous capital 
cost reductions for renewables (IEA, 2017c). 
Estimates of demand-side investments, either in total or for incremental 
efficiency efforts, are more uncertain, mainly due to a lack of reliable 
statistics and definitional issues about what exactly is counted towards 
a demand-side investment and what the reference should be for 
estimating incremental efficiency (McCollum et al., 2013). Grubler and 
154

Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development

Wilson (2014) use two working definitions (a broader and a narrower 
one) to provide a first-order estimate of historical end-use technology 
investments in total. The broad definition defines end-use technologies 
as the technological systems purchasable by final consumers in order 
to provide a useful service, for example, heating and air conditioning 
systems, cars, freezers, or aircraft. The narrow definition sets the boundary 
at the specific energy-using components or subsystems of the larger end-
use technologies (e.g., compressor, car engine, heating element). Based 
on these two definitions, demand-side energy investments for the year 
2005 were estimated about 1–3.5 trillion USD2010 (central estimate 1.7 
trillion USD2010) using the broad definition and 0.1–0.6 trillion USD2010 
(central estimate 0.3 trillion USD2010) using the narrower definition. 
Due to these definitional issues, demand-side investment projections are 
uncertain, often underreported, and difficult to compare. Global IAMs 
often do not fully and explicitly represent all the various measures that 
could improve end-use efficiency.
Research carried out by six global IAM teams found that 1.5°C-consistent 
climate policies would require a marked upscaling of energy system 
supply-side investments (resource extraction, power generation, fuel 
conversion, pipelines/transmission, and energy storage) between 
now and mid-century, reaching levels of between 1.6–3.8 trillion 
USD2010 yr−1 globally on average over the 2016–2050 timeframe 
(McCollum et al., 2018) (Figure 2.27). How these investment needs 
compare to those in a policy baseline scenario is uncertain: they could 
be higher, much higher, or lower. Investments in the policy baselines 
from these same models are 1.6–2.7 trillion USD2010 yr−1. Much 
hinges on the reductions in energy demand growth embodied in the 
1.5°C pathways, which require investing in energy efficiency. Studies 
suggest that annual supply-side investments by mid-century could be 
lowered by around 10% (McCollum et al., 2018) and in some cases up 
to 50% (Grubler et al., 2018) if strong policies to limit energy demand 
growth are successfully implemented. However, the degree to which 
these supply-side reductions would be partially offset by an increase in 
demand-side investments is unclear. 
Some trends are robust across scenarios (Figure 2.27). First, pursuing 
1.5°C mitigation efforts requires a major reallocation of the investment 
portfolio, implying a financial system aligned to mitigation challenges. 
The path laid out by countries’ current NDCs until 2030 will not 
drive these structural changes; and despite increasing low-carbon 
investments in recent years (IEA, 2016b; Frankfurt School-UNEP Centre/
BNEF, 2017), these are not yet aligned with 1.5°C. Second, additional 
annual average energy-related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 
in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C compared to the baseline (i.e., 
pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today) 
are estimated by the models employed in McCollum et al. (2018) to 
be around 830 billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion 
USD2010 across six models). This compares to total annual average 
energy supply investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion 
USD2010 and total annual average energy demand investments of 
640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energy-
related investments increase by about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 
1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Average annual investment 
in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled 
by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared 
to 2015. Specifically, annual investments in low-carbon energy are 
projected to average 0.8–2.9 trillion USD2010 yr−1 globally to 2050 
in 1.5°C pathways, overtaking fossil investments globally already by 
around 2025 (McCollum et al., 2018). The bulk of these investments 
are projected to be for clean electricity generation, particularly solar 
and wind power (0.09–1.0 trillion USD2010 yr−1 and 0.1–0.35 trillion 
USD2010 yr−1, respectively) as well as nuclear power (0.1–0.25 trillion 
USD2010 yr−1). Third, the precise apportioning of these investments 
depends on model assumptions and societal preferences related to 
mitigation strategies and policy choices (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3). 
Investments for electricity transmission and distribution and storage 
are also scaled up in 1.5°C pathways (0.3–1.3 trillion USD2010 yr−1), 
given their widespread electrification of the end-use sectors (see 
Section 2.4). Meanwhile, 1.5°C pathways see a reduction in annual 
investments for fossil-fuel extraction and unabated fossil electricity 
generation (to 0.3–0.85 trillion USD2010 yr−1 on average over the 
2016–2050 period). Investments in unabated coal are halted by 2030 
in most 1.5°C projections, while the literature is less conclusive for 
investments in unabated gas (McCollum et al., 2018). This illustrates 
how mitigation strategies vary between models, but in the real world 
should be considered in terms of their societal desirability (see Section 
2.5.3). Furthermore, some fossil investments made over the next few 
years – or those made in the last few – will likely need to be retired prior 
to fully recovering their capital investment or before the end of their 
operational lifetime (Bertram et al., 2015a; Johnson et al., 2015; OECD/
IEA and IRENA, 2017). How the pace of the energy transition will be 
affected by such dynamics, namely with respect to politics and society, 
is not well captured by global IAMs at present. Modelling studies 
have, however, shown how the reliability of institutions influences 
investment risks and hence climate mitigation investment decisions 
(Iyer et al., 2015), finding that a lack of regulatory credibility or policy 
commitment fails to stimulate low-carbon investments (Bosetti and 
Victor, 2011; Faehn and Isaksen, 2016).
Low-carbon supply-side investment needs are projected to be largest in 
OECD countries and those of developing Asia. The regional distribution 
of investments in 1.5°C pathways estimated by the multiple models 
in (McCollum et al., 2018) are the following (average over 2016–2050 
timeframe): 0.30–1.3 trillion USD2010 yr−1(ASIA), 0.35–0.85 trillion 
USD2010 yr−1 (OECD), 0.08–0.55 trillion USD2010 yr−1 (MAF), 0.07–0.25 
trillion USD2010 yr−1 (LAM), and 0.05–0.15 trillion USD2010 yr−1 (REF) 
(regions are defined consistent with their use in AR5 WGIII, see Table 
A.II.8 in Krey et al., 2014b).
Until now, IAM investment analyses of 1.5°C pathways have focused 
on middle-of-the-road socio-economic and technological development 
futures (SSP2) (Fricko et al., 2017). Consideration of a broader range 
of development futures would yield different outcomes in terms of 
the magnitudes of the projected investment levels. Sensitivity analyses 
indicate that the magnitude of supply-side investments as well as the 
investment portfolio do not change strongly across the SSPs for a given 
level of climate policy stringency (McCollum et al., 2018). With only one 
dedicated multimodel comparison study published, there is limited to 
medium evidence available. For some features, there is high agreement 
across modelling frameworks leading, for example, to medium to high 
confidence that limiting global temperature increase to 1.5°C would 
require a major reallocation of the investment portfolio. Given the limited 
amount of sensitivity cases available compared to the default SSP2

assumptions, medium confidence can be assigned to the specific energy 
and climate mitigation investment estimates reported here.
Assumptions in modelling studies indicate a number of challenges. 
For instance, access to finance and mobilization of funds are critical 
(Fankhauser et al., 2016; OECD, 2017). In turn, policy efforts need to be 
effective in redirecting financial resources (UNEP, 2015; OECD, 2017) and 
reducing transaction costs for bankable mitigation projects (i.e. projects 
that have adequate future cash flow, collateral, etc. so lenders are willing 
to finance it), particularly on the demand side (Mundaca et al., 2013; 
Brunner and Enting, 2014; Grubler et al., 2018). Assumptions also imply 
that policy certainty, regulatory oversight mechanisms and fiduciary duty 
need to be robust and effective to safeguard credible and stable financial 
markets and de-risk mitigation investments in the long term (Clarke et 
al., 2014; Mundaca et al., 2016; EC, 2017; OECD, 2017). Importantly, 
the different time horizons that actors have in the competitive finance 
industry are typically not explicitly captured by modelling assumptions 
(Harmes, 2011). See Chapter 4, Section 4.4.5 for details of climate 
finance in practice.
In summary and despite inherent uncertainties, the emerging literature 
indicates a gap between current investment patterns and those 
compatible with 1.5°C (or 2°C) pathways (limited to medium evidence, 
high agreement). Estimates and assumptions from modelling frameworks 
suggest a major shift in investment patterns and entail a financial system 
effectively aligned with mitigation challenges (high confidence).

1074 GtCO2 (multimodel mean: 952 GtCO2) in the ‘2°C’ pathway and from 206 to 525 GtCO2 (mean: 390 GtCO2) in the ‘1.5°C’ pathway.

Sustainable Development Features 
of 1.5°C Pathways
Potential synergies and trade-offs between 1.5°C mitigation pathways 
and different sustainable development (SD) dimensions (see Cross-
Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1) are an emerging field of research. Chapter 
5, Section 5.4 assesses interactions between individual mitigation 
measures with other societal objectives, as well as the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) (Table 5.1). This section synthesized 
the Chapter 5 insights to assess how these interactions play out 
in integrated 1.5°C pathways, and the four illustrative pathway 
archetypes of this chapter in particular (see Section 2.1). Information 
from integrated pathways is combined with the interactions assessed 
in Chapter 5 and aggregated for each SDG, with a level of confidence 
attributed to each interaction based on the amount and agreement of 
the scientific evidence (see Chapter 5). 
Figure 2.28 |  Interactions of individual mitigation measures and alternative mitigations portfolios for 1.5°C with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
The assessment of interactions between mitigation measures and individual SDGs is based on the assessment of Chapter 5, Section 5.4. Proxy indicators and synthesis method are 
described in Supplementary Material  2.SM.1.5.

Chapter 2
Figure 2.28 shows how the scale and combination of individual 
mitigation measures (i.e., their mitigation portfolios) influence the 
extent of synergies and trade-offs with other societal objectives. All 
pathways generate multiple synergies with sustainable development 
dimensions and can advance several other SDGs simultaneously. Some, 
however, show higher risks for trade-offs. An example is increased 
biomass production and its potential to increase pressure on land and 
water resources, food production, and biodiversity and to reduce air 
quality when combusted inefficiently. At the same time, mitigation 
actions in energy-demand sectors and behavioural response options 
with appropriate management of rebound effects can advance multiple 
SDGs simultaneously, more so than energy supply-side mitigation 
actions (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4, Table 5.1 and Figure 5.3 for more 
examples). Of the four pathway archetypes used in this chapter (LED, 
S1, S2, and S5, referred to as P1, P2, P3, and P4 in the Summary for 
Policymakers), the S1 and LED pathways show the largest number of 
synergies and least number of potential trade-offs, while for the S5 
pathway more potential trade-offs are identified. In general, pathways 
with emphasis on demand reductions and policies that incentivize 
behavioural change, sustainable consumption patterns, healthy diets 
and relatively low use of CDR (or only afforestation) show relatively 
more synergies with individual SDGs than other pathways.
There is robust evidence and high agreement in the pathway literature 
that multiple strategies can be considered to limit warming to 1.5°C (see 
Sections 2.1.3, 2.3 and 2.4). Together with the extensive evidence on 
the existence of interactions of mitigation measures with other societal 
objectives (Chapter 5, Section 5.4), this results in high confidence that 
the choice of mitigation portfolio or strategy can markedly affect the 
achievement of other societal objectives. For instance, action on SLCFs 
has been suggested to facilitate the achievement of SDGs (Shindell et 
al., 2017b) and to reduce regional impacts, for example, from black 
carbon sources on snow and ice loss in the Arctic and alpine regions 
(Painter et al., 2013), with particular focus on the warming sub-set of 
SLCFs. Reductions in both surface aerosols and ozone through methane 
reductions provide health and ecosystem co-benefits (Jacobson, 2002, 
2010; Anenberg et al., 2012; Shindell et al., 2012; Stohl et al., 2015; 
Collins et al., 2018). Public health benefits of stringent mitigation 
pathways in line with 1.5°C pathways can be sizeable. For instance, 
a study examining a more rapid reduction of fossil-fuel usage to 
achieve 1.5°C relative to 2°C, similar to that of other recent studies 
(Grubler et al., 2018; van Vuuren et al., 2018), found that improved 
air quality would lead to more than 100 million avoided premature 
deaths over the 21st century (Shindell et al., 2018). These benefits are 
assumed to be in addition to those occurring under 2°C pathways 
(e.g., Silva et al., 2016), and could in monetary terms offset either a 
large portion or all of the initial mitigation costs (West et al., 2013; 
Shindell et al., 2018). However, some sources of SLCFs with important 
impacts for public health (e.g., traditional biomass burning) are only 
mildly affected by climate policy in the available integrated pathways 
and are more strongly impacted by baseline assumptions about future 
societal development and preferences, and technologies instead (Rao 
et al., 2016, 2017).
At the same time, the literature on climate–SDG interactions is still 
an emergent field of research and hence there is low to medium 
confidence in the precise magnitude of the majority of these 
interactions. Very limited literature suggests that achieving co-benefits 
is not automatically assured but results from conscious and carefully 
coordinated policies and implementation strategies (Shukla and 
Chaturvedi, 2012; Clarke et al., 2014; McCollum et al., 2018). 
Understanding these mitigation–SDG interactions is key for selecting 
mitigation options that maximize synergies and minimize trade-offs 
towards the 1.5°C and sustainable development objectives (van Vuuren 
et al., 2015; Hildingsson and Johansson, 2016; Jakob and Steckel, 2016; 
von Stechow et al., 2016; Delponte et al., 2017).
In summary, the combined evidence indicates that the chosen 
mitigation portfolio can have a distinct impact on the achievement 
of other societal policy objectives (high confidence); however, there is 
uncertainty regarding the specific extent of climate–SDG interactions.
2.6 
Knowledge Gaps
This section summarizes the knowledge gaps articulated in earlier 
sections of the chapter.
2.6.1 
Geophysical Understanding 
Knowledge gaps are associated with the carbon cycle response, the 
role of non-CO2 emissions and the evaluation of an appropriate historic 
baseline. 
Quantifying how the carbon cycle responds to negative emissions is 
an important knowledge gap for strong mitigation pathways (Section 
2.2). Earth system feedback uncertainties are important to consider for 
the longer-term response, particularly in how permafrost melting might 
affect the carbon budget (Section 2.2). Future research and ongoing 
observations over the next years will provide a better indication as to 
how the 2006-2015 base period compares with the long-term trends 
and might at present bias the carbon budget estimates.
The future emissions of short-lived climate forcers and their 
temperature response are a large source of uncertainty in 1.5°C 
pathways, having a greater relative uncertainty than in higher CO2 
emission pathways. Their global emissions, their sectoral and regional 
disaggregation, and their climate response are generally less well 
quantified than for CO2 (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). Emissions from the 
agricultural sector, including land-use based mitigation options, in 
1.5°C pathways constitute the main source of uncertainty here and 
are an important gap in understanding the potential achievement of 
stringent mitigation scenarios (Sections 2.3 and 2.4). This also includes 
uncertainties surrounding the mitigation potential of the long-lived 
GHG nitrous oxide (Sections 2.3 and 2.4).
There is considerable uncertainty in how future emissions of aerosol 
precursors will affect the effective radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud 
interaction. The potential future warming from mitigation of these 
emissions reduces remaining carbon budgets and increases peak 
temperatures (Section 2.2). The potential co-benefits of mitigating air 
pollutants and how the reduction in air pollution may affect the carbon 
sink are also important sources of uncertainty (Sections 2.2 and 2.5).
158
Chapter 2 
Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development
2
The pathway classification employed in this chapter employs results 
from the MAGICC model with its AR5 parameter sets. The alternative 
representation of the relationship between emissions and effective 
radiative forcing and response in the FAIR model would lead to a different 
classification that would make 1.5°C targets more achievable (Section 
2.2 and Supplementary Material 2.SM.1.1). Such a revision would 
significantly alter the temperature outcomes for the pathways and, if 
the result is found to be robust, future research and assessments would 
need to adjust their classifications accordingly. Any possible high bias in 
the MAGICC response may be partly or entirely offset by missing Earth 
system feedbacks that are not represented in either climate emulator and 
that would act to increase the temperature response (Section 2.2). For 
this assessment report, any possible bias in the MAGICC setup applied 
in this and earlier reports is not established enough in the literature to 
change the classification approach. However, we only place medium 
confidence in the classification adopted by the chapter. 
2.6.2 
Integrated Assessment Approaches
IAMs attempt to be as broad as possible in order to explore 
interactions between various societal subsystems, like the economy, 
land, and energy system. They hence include stylized and simplified 
representations of these subsystems. Climate damages, avoided 
impacts and societal co-benefits of the modelled transformations 
remain largely unaccounted for and are important knowledge gaps. 
Furthermore, rapid technological changes and uncertainties about 
input data present continuous challenges.
The IAMs used in this report do not account for climate impacts 
(Section 2.1), and similarly, none of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
projections in the mitigation pathway literature assessed in this chapter 
included the feedback of climate damages on economic growth (Section 
2.3). Although some IAMs do allow for climate impact feedbacks in 
their modelling frameworks, particularly in their land components, 
such feedbacks were by design excluded in pathways developed in the 
context of the SSP framework. The SSP framework aims at providing 
an integrative framework for the assessment of climate change 
adaptation and mitigation. IAMs are typically developed to inform 
the mitigation component of this question, while the assessment of 
impacts is carried out by specialized impact models. However, the use 
of a consistent set of socio-economic drivers embodied by the SSPs 
allows for an integrated assessment of climate change impacts and 
mitigation challenges at a later stage. Further integration of these 
two strands of research will allow a better understanding of climate 
impacts on mitigation studies.
Many of the IAMs that contributed mitigation pathways to this 
assessment include a process-based description of the land system in 
addition to the energy system, and several have been extended to cover 
air pollutants and water use. These features make them increasingly fit 
to explore questions beyond those that touch upon climate mitigation 
only. The models do not, however, fully account for all constraints that 
could affect realization of pathways (Section 2.1).
While the representation of renewable energy resource potentials, 
technology costs and system integration in IAMs has been updated 
since AR5, bottom-up studies find higher mitigation potentials in the 
industry, buildings, and transport sector in that realized by selected 
pathways from IAMs, indicating the possibility to strengthen sectoral 
decarbonization strategies compared to the IAM 1.5°C pathways 
assessed in this chapter (Section 2.1).
Studies indicate that a major shift in investment patterns is required 
to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This assessment would benefit from 
a more explicit representation and understanding of the financial 
sector within the modelling approaches. Assumptions in modelling 
studies imply low-to-zero transaction costs for market agents and 
that regulatory oversight mechanisms and fiduciary duty need to be 
highly robust to guarantee stable and credible financial markets in 
the long term. This area can be subject to high uncertainty, however. 
The heterogeneity of actors (e.g., banks, insurance companies, asset 
managers, or credit rating agencies) and financial products also needs 
to be taken into account, as does the mobilization of capital and 
financial flows between countries and regions (Section 2.5). 
The literature on interactions between 1.5˚C mitigation pathways 
and SDGs is an emergent field of research (Section 2.3.5, 2.5 and Chapter 
5). Whereas the choice of mitigation strategies can noticeably affect the 
attainment of various societal objectives, there is uncertainty regarding 
the extent of the majority of identified interactions. Understanding 
climate–SDG interactions helps inform the choice of mitigation options 
that minimize trade-offs and risks and maximize synergies towards 
sustainable development objectives and the 1.5°C goal (Section 2.5).
2.6.3 
Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) 
Most 1.5°C and 2°C pathways are heavily reliant on CDR at a 
speculatively large scale before mid-century. There are a number 
of knowledge gaps associated which such technologies. Chapter 4 
performs a detailed assessment of CDR technologies.
There is uncertainty in the future deployment of CCS given the 
limited pace of current deployment, the evolution of CCS technology 
that would be associated with deployment, and the current lack of 
incentives for large-scale implementation of CCS (Chapter 4, Section 
4.2.7). Technologies other than BECCS and afforestation have yet to 
be comprehensively assessed in integrated assessment approaches. No 
proposed technology is close to deployment at scale, and regulatory 
frameworks are not established. This limits how they can be realistically 
implemented within IAMs. (Section 2.3)
Evaluating the potential from BECCS is problematic due to large 
uncertainties in future land projections due to differences in modelling 
approaches in current land-use models, and these differences are 
at least as great as the differences attributed to climate scenario 
variations. (Section 2.3)
There is substantial uncertainty about the adverse effects of large-
scale CDR deployment on the environment and societal sustainable 
development goals. It is not fully understood how land-use and 
land-management choices for large-scale BECCS will affect various 
ecosystem services and sustainable development, and how they further 
translate into indirect impacts on climate, including GHG emissions 
other than CO2. (Section 2.3, Section 2.5.3)

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 2.1 | What Kind of Pathways Limit Warming to 1.5°C and are we on Track?
Summary: There is no definitive way to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This 
Special Report identifies two main conceptual pathways to illustrate different interpretations. One stabilizes 
global temperature at, or just below, 1.5°C. Another sees global temperature temporarily exceed 1.5°C before 
coming back down. Countries’ pledges to reduce their emissions are currently not in line with limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C.
Scientists use computer models to simulate the emissions of greenhouse gases that would be consistent with 
different levels of warming. The different possibilities are often referred to as ‘greenhouse gas emission 
pathways’. There is no single, definitive pathway to limiting warming to 1.5°C.
This IPCC special report identifies two main pathways that explore global warming of 1.5°C. The first involves 
global temperature stabilizing at or below before 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The second pathway sees 
warming exceed 1.5°C around mid-century, remain above 1.5°C for a maximum duration of a few decades, and 
return to below 1.5°C before 2100. The latter is often referred to as an ‘overshoot’ pathway. Any alternative 
situation in which global temperature continues to rise, exceeding 1.5°C permanently until the end of the 21st 
century, is not considered to be a 1.5°C pathway.
The two types of pathway have different implications for greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for climate change 
impacts and for achieving sustainable development. For example, the larger and longer an ‘overshoot’, the 
greater the reliance on practices or technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, on top of reducing 
the sources of emissions (mitigation). Such ideas for CO2 removal have not been proven to work at scale and, 
therefore, run the risk of being less practical, effective or economical than assumed. There is also the risk that 
the use of CO2 removal techniques ends up competing for land and water, and if these trade-offs are not 
appropriately managed, they can adversely affect sustainable development. Additionally, a larger and longer 
overshoot increases the risk for irreversible climate impacts, such as the onset of the collapse of polar ice shelves 
and accelerated sea level rise.
Countries that formally accept or ‘ratify’ the Paris Agreement submit pledges for how they intend to address 
climate change. Unique to each country, these pledges are known as Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs). Different groups of researchers around the world have analysed the combined effect of adding up all 
the NDCs. Such analyses show that current pledges are not on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-
industrial levels. If current pledges for 2030 are achieved but no more, researchers find very few (if any) ways to 
reduce emissions after 2030 sufficiently quickly to limit warming to 1.5°C. This, in turn, suggests that with the 
national pledges as they stand, warming would exceed 1.5°C, at least for a period of time, and practices and 
technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere at a global scale would be required to return warming to 
1.5°C at a later date.
A world that is consistent with holding warming to 1.5°C would see greenhouse gas emissions rapidly decline 
in the coming decade, with strong international cooperation and a scaling up of countries’ combined ambition 
beyond current NDCs. In contrast, delayed action, limited international cooperation, and weak or fragmented 
policies that lead to stagnating or increasing greenhouse gas emissions would put the possibility of limiting 
global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels out of reach.

Frequently Asked Questions 
FAQ 2.2 | What do Energy Supply and Demand have to do with Limiting Warming  
 
to 1.5°C?
Summary: Limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels would require major reductions in green-
house gas emissions in all sectors. But different sectors are not independent of each other, and making changes 
in one can have implications for another. For example, if we as a society use a lot of energy, then this could 
mean we have less flexibility in the choice of mitigation options available to limit warming to 1.5°C. If we use 
less energy, the choice of possible actions is greater – for example, we could be less reliant on technologies that 
remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.
To stabilize global temperature at any level, ‘net’ CO2 emissions would need to be reduced to zero. This means the 
amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere must equal the amount that is removed. Achieving a balance between 
CO2 ‘sources’ and ‘sinks’ is often referred to as ‘net zero’ emissions or ‘carbon neutrality’. The implication of net 
zero emissions is that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere would slowly decline over time until a new 
equilibrium is reached, as CO2 emissions from human activity are redistributed and taken up by the oceans and 
the land biosphere. This would lead to a near-constant global temperature over many centuries. 
Warming will not be limited to 1.5°C or 2°C unless transformations in a number of areas achieve the required 
greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Emissions would need to decline rapidly across all of society’s main sectors, 
including buildings, industry, transport, energy, and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU). Actions 
that can reduce emissions include, for example, phasing out coal in the energy sector, increasing the amount of 
energy produced from renewable sources, electrifying transport, and reducing the ‘carbon footprint’ of the food 
we consume.
The above are examples of ‘supply-side’ actions. Broadly speaking, these are actions that can reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions through the use of low-carbon solutions. A different type of action can reduce how much energy 
human society uses, while still ensuring increasing levels of development and well-being. Known as ‘demand-side’ 
actions, this category includes improving energy efficiency in buildings and reducing consumption of energy- 
and greenhouse-gas intensive products through behavioural and lifestyle changes, for example. Demand- and 
supply-side measures are not an either-or question, they work in parallel with each other. But emphasis can be 
given to one or the other. 
Making changes in one sector can have consequences for another, as they are not independent of each other. 
In other words, the choices that we make now as a society in one sector can either restrict or expand our 
options later on. For example, a high demand for energy could mean we would need to deploy almost all known 
options to reduce emissions in order to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, with 
the potential for adverse side-effects. In particular, a pathway with high energy demand would increase our 
reliance on practices and technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere. As of yet, such techniques have 
not been proven to work on a large scale and, depending on how they are implemented, could compete for land 
and water. By leading to lower overall energy demand, effective demand-side measures could allow for greater 
flexibility in how we structure our energy system. However, demand-side measures are not easy to implement 
and barriers have prevented the most efficient practices being used in the past.
