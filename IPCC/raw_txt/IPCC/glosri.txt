Activity data
Data on the magnitude of human activity resulting in emissions or removals
taking place during a given period of time. In the energy sector for example,
the annual activity data for fuel combustion sources are the total amounts
of fuel burned. Annual activity data for methane emissions from enteric
fermentation are the total number of animals being raised, by species.
Adipic acid
A material primarily used in the chemical industry as an intermediate step in
the production of nylon. The process of producing adipic acid also produces
nitrous oxide (N2O) as a by-product.
Afforestation
Planting of new forests on lands which, historically, have not contained
forests. These newly created forests are included in the category Changes
in Forest and Other Woody Biomass Stocks in the Land Use Change and
Forestry module of the emissions inventory calculations.
See also Reforestation.
Alcohol
For the purposes of the inventory preparation alcohols include methyl
alcohol (methanol), ethyl alcohol (ethanol) and tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA)
(2-methyl propan-2-ol).
Alcohol produced from non-biomass sources for use as a blending
component in fuels should be included with refinery feedstocks figures in
the inventory.
Bio-alcohol used in fuels should be reported as a liquid biomass for
information only.
Anaerobic
Conditions in which oxygen is not readily available. These are important for
the production of methane emissions. Whenever organic material

Anthracite
A high rank coal with generally less than 10 per cent volatile matter.
Anthropogenic
Man-made, resulting from human activities. In the Guidelines, anthropogenic
emissions are distinguished from natural emissions. Many of the greenhouse
gases are emitted naturally. It is only the man-made increments over natural
emissions which may be perturbing natural balances.

enables a linear scale to be used on the stem of a density-measuring device
like a hydrometer.
Apparent consumption
A concept used in the calculation of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel
consumption. This concept deals with apparent rather than actual
consumption because it tracks the consumption of primary fuels to an
economy with adjustments for net imports and stock changes in secondary
fuels. While this procedure ensures that all of the carbon in fuels is
accounted for, it is important to note that it does not produce actual
consumption by specific fuel or fuel product. In cases where exports of
secondary fuels exceed imports, it will produce negative numbers. This is
clearly not an accurate estimate of the consumption of secondary fuel. It is
merely an adjustment to the primary fuel supply calculated elsewhere in the
worksheet.
Aviation Gasoline
See Gasoline.
Base year
The year for which the inventory is to be taken. This is currently 1990. In some
cases (such as estimating CH4 from rice production) the base year is simply the

Bunker fuels (International)
Fuels consumed for international marine and air transportation.
Calcination
Chemical process in the manufacture of cement in which the raw materials
(primarily limestone – calcium carbonate) are heated in kilns producing lime
and CO2.
Calorific value
The calorific value of a fuel is a measure of its value for heating purposes.  It
is expressed in terms of the heat released from a specified unit quantity
under defined conditions of complete combustion.  The calorific value is
sometimes referred to as the heating value of the fuel.
Two measures of calorific value are possible and are referred to as the net
(NCV) and gross (GCV) calorific values.  Also termed the lower (LHV) and
higher (HHV) heating values.
The Gross Calorific Value is the total quantity of heat released during
combustion when all water formed by the combustion reaction is returned
to the liquid state.
The Net Calorific Value is the total quantity of heat released during
combustion when all water formed by the combustion reaction remains in
the vapour state.
The Net Calorific Value is therefore less than the Gross Calorific Value.
For natural gas this difference is approximately 9-10 per cent whilst for oils
and coals the difference is approximately 5 per cent.
Throughout the Guidelines net calorific values are used and expressed in SI
units, for example TJ/kt.  The term Conversion Factor has two uses.  First, as
net calorific value, to convert quantities expressed in natural units to energy
units and, secondly as a scaling factor to convert one form of energy unit to
another (e.g. Btus to GJ).
CFCs

Process emissions
Emissions from industrial processes involving chemical transformations
other than combustion.
Refinery Feedstocks and Blending Components
Refinery feedstocks are processed oils destined for further processing in
refineries (e.g. straight run fuel oil or vacuum gas oil).  For IPCC purposes
they include non-biomass alcohols as oxygenates for blending in motor
gasoline whether within or outside refineries.
Refinery Gas (not liquefied)
Refinery gas includes a mixture of non-condensable gases mainly consisting
of hydrogen, methane, ethane, and olefins obtained during distillation of
crude oil or treatment of oil products (e.g., cracking) in refineries.  This also
includes gases which are returned from the petrochemical industry.
Reforestation
Planting of forests on lands which have, historically, previously contained
forests but which have been converted to some other use. Replanted
forests are included in the category "Changes in Forest and Other Woody
Biomass Stocks" in the Land Use Change and Forestry module of the
emissions inventory calculations.
See also Afforestation.
Residual Fuel Oil
This covers all residual (heavy) fuel oils (including those obtained by
blending).  Kinematic viscosity is above 10 cSt at 80°C.  The flash point is
always above 50°C and density is always more than 0.90 kg/l.
Ruminant animals
Herbivores (grazing animals such as cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels)
which have a large free stomach or rumen. Digestion in anaerobic
conditions in the rumen can create significant emissions of methane from
ruminant animals.
Savanna
Savannas are tropical and subtropical formations with continuous grass
cover, occasionally interrupted by trees and shrubs.  Savannas are found in
Africa, Latin America, Asia and Australia.
Seasonal (forest)
Semi-deciduous forests with a distinct wet and dry season and rainfall
between 1200 and 2000 mm per year.
Season length (in rice agriculture)
The number of days during which rice is grown on a given field.  The field is
not necessarily flooded for the entire season.

Sequestered carbon
See Stored carbon.
Sludge Gas
Sewage gas and gas from the anaerobic decomposition of animal slurries.
Steam Coal
See Bituminous Coal.
Stored carbon
Carbon retained for long periods of time within non-fuel products
manufactured from fuels.
Sulphite Lies (Black Liquor)
An alkaline spent liquor from the digesters in the production of sulphate or
soda pulp during the manufacture of paper.  The energy content derives
from the lignin removed from the wood pulp.
Sub-bituminous Coal
Non-agglomerating coals with a gross calorific value between 17,435 kJ/kg
(4165 kcal/kg) and 23,865 kJ/kg (5700 cal/kg) containing more than 31 per
cent volatile matter on dry mineral matter free basis.
See also Lignite. The distinction between Sub-bituminous coal and Lignite is
not normally made in Europe.
Synthetic crude oil
Synthetic crude oil, including mineral oils extracted from shales, bituminous
sand etc. should be included with the figures for crude oil.
Temperate (Rain Forests)
Woodland of temperate but usually rather mild climate areas with heavy
rainfall, usually including numerous kinds of trees and distinguished from a
tropical rain forest by the presence of a dominant tree.
Temperate Zone
The area between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle or between
the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle.
Trace gas emission ratios (Non-CO2)
Ratios for carbon compounds are mass of carbon released as CH4 or CO
(in units of C) relative to mass of total carbon released from burning (in
units of C). Those for nitrogen compounds are expressed as the ratios of
nitrogen released as N2O and NOx relative to the nitrogen content of the
fuel (in units of N).

Tropical (Rain Forests)
Tropical woodland with an annual rainfall of at least 100 inches and marked
by lofty broad leafed evergreen trees forming a continuous canopy.

United Nations Environment Programme.
UNFCCC
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Vegetal Waste
Includes wood waste, straw, bagasse etc.
Venting
The release of gas to the atmosphere which cannot be contained or used
productively. In some cases, when associated natural gas is released along
with oil from production fields remote from energy users, the gas is
allowed to escape into the atmosphere.
The IPCC Guidelines classify emissions from venting and flaring as fugitive
emissions.
See also Flaring.
Volatile solids
The amount of organic material that disappears after drying.
Water management regime
A variety of practices used to classify rice production into categories for
estimating emissions of methane. The three major water management
regimes are irrigated, rainfed and deepwater.  Upland (dry) rice cultivation
produces little or no methane, while the continuously flooded category is a
significant source.
White Spirit and SBP
White Spirit and SBP are defined as refined distillate intermediates with a
distillation in the naphtha/kerosene range.  They are sub-divided as:
Industrial Spirit (SBP):  light oils distilling between 30°C and 200°C.  There
are 7 or 8 grades of industrial spirit, depending on the position of the cut in
the distillation range.  The grades are defined according to the temperature
difference between the 5 per cent volume and 90 per cent volume
distillation points (which is not more than 60°C).
