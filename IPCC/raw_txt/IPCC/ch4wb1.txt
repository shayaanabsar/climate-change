Introduction
The Agriculture module looks at greenhouse gas emissions from five
sources:
•
Domestic Livestock: Enteric Fermentation and Manure Management
•
Rice Cultivation: Flooded Rice Fields
•
Prescribed Burning of Savannas
•
Field Burning of Agricultural Residues
•  Agricultural Soils
4.2 
Domestic Livestock
4 . 2 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
This submodule deals with methane and nitrous oxide from two sources:
• enteric fermentation
• manure management
Methane from enteric fermentation is produced in herbivores as a
by-product of the digestive process by which carbohydrates are broken
down by micro-organisms into simple molecules for absorption into the
blood-stream.  Both ruminant animals (e.g., cattle, sheep) and some non-
ruminant animals (e.g., pigs, horses) produce methane, although ruminants
are the largest source.  The amount of CH4 that is released depends upon
the type, age and weight of the animal and the quantity and quality of the
feed consumed.
Methane from the management of animal manure occurs as the result of its
decomposition under anaerobic conditions.  These conditions often occur
when a large number of animals are managed in a confined area (e.g., dairy
farms, beef feedlots, and swine and poultry farms).
Emissions of methane from wild animals and termites are not included in this
submodule.  The focus in the IPCC Guidelines is on anthropogenic emissions.
While there are human interactions with natural sources such as wild
animals and termites, they are complex and highly uncertain.
4 . 2 . 2  D a t a  s o u r c e s
There are no individual sources that will provide all the data needed to
estimate methane emissions from domestic livestock.  The Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations publishes a series
entitled The FAO Production Yearbook (e.g., FAO, 1991).  This series has
information about livestock populations and the production and

consumption of livestock products.  The FAO data should be supplemented
with studies conducted for individual countries.  Many countries publish
results of their agricultural census that includes data on production levels in
addition to livestock populations.  Table 4-1 summarises the data needed.

Although the methodological issues are very complex, a simplified
methodology is used for the purposes of this Workbook.
For a detailed discussion of the methodology, see the Greenhouse Gas
Inventory Reference Manual.  Broadly, emissions are calculated by applying an
emission factor to the number of animals of each livestock type in the
country to produce a total for enteric fermentation.  Default emission
factors are provided for developed and developing countries with more
regional detail for cattle, the most important source from this activity.

The same basic methodology is used to estimate emissions from manure
management.  In this area default emission factors are provided by region
and for three different climate regimes.  Simple multiplication of populations
by emission factors produces emissions estimates.

For each type of livestock in the Worksheet, enter the number in
thousands in column A.
Refer to FAO Production Yearbooks (e.g., FAO 1991) if there are no
locally available data.  It is recommended that national experts use
three-year averages for activity data if available so that the data not be
skewed in the event that the base year of the inventory was an
exceptional year not representative of the country’s normal activity
level.
2
For each type of livestock, enter an average Emission Factor in column B
in kilograms per head per year (this is the same as tonnes per thousand
head per year).  Use a figure from the tables below or more precise
locally available data.  Because cattle are the most important source and
because the emission factors for cattle vary significantly among regions,
region-specific default factors are provided.  Choose emission factors
for cattle that are most appropriate for your national situation.

For each type of animal, enter the Emissions Factor for Manure
Management in column D in kilograms per head per year.  Use default
data in the tables which follow or more precise locally available data.
Table 4-4 provides default emission factors for most livestock types
with different values for developed and developing countries to reflect
different conditions and typical practices.  Factors are also provided for
3 different climates.  Users should select the factors which best
represent their conditions.  For large countries it may be necessary to
subdivide populations into more than one climate region.  In that case
the user can proceed with calculations in one of two ways.
a
Develop an average emissions factor.  For example:
If 25 per cent of sheep are in a temperate region and 75 per cent in
a warm region, then
EF= (0.25 x 0.16) + (0.75 x 0.21) = 0.20 kg/head/yr

If users do develop and average emission factors, they should state
what they have done and should document their sources.
b
An alternative approach is to make extra copies of the Worksheet
and complete one for each region for the manure portion, then add
the results and enter the sum on the main Worksheet.
Swine, buffalo and cattle are the most important source of manure
emissions and the most variable by region, therefore detailed
emission factors are provided in a separate table.

Multiply the Number of Animals by the Emission Factor for Manure
Management to give the Emissions from Manure Management in t/yr.

The range of estimates reflects cool to warm climates.  Climate regions are defined in terms of annual
average temperature as follows:  Cool = less than 15°C; Temperate = 15°C to 25°C inclusive; and
Warm = greater than 25°C. Cool, Temperate and Warm regions are estimated using Methane
Conversion Factors of 1%, 1.5% and 2%, respectively.
a Temp. = Temperate climate region.
b Chickens, ducks, and turkeys.
All estimates are ± 20 percent.
Sources: Emission factors developed from: feed intake values and feed digestibilities used to develop the
enteric fermentation emission factors (see Appendix A of the Reference Manual Chapter 4); MCF, and
Bo values reported in Woodbury and Hashimoto (1993).  All manure is assumed to be managed in dry
systems, which is consistent with the manure management system usage reported in Woodbury and
Hashimoto (1993).

Rice Cultivation
4 . 3 . 1  I n t r o d u c t i o n
Anaerobic decomposition of organic material in flooded rice fields produces
methane (CH4), which escapes to the atmosphere primarily by diffusive
transport through the rice plants during the growing season.  Upland rice
fields, which are not flooded and therefore do not produce significant
quantities of CH4, account for approximately 10 per cent of the global rice
production and about 15 per cent of the global rice area under cultivation.
The remaining area is grown for wetland rice, consisting of irrigated, rainfed,
and deepwater rice.  The global wetland rice area harvested annually in the
early 1980s was about 123.2 million hectares (total harvested area including
upland rice is 144 Mha), over 90 per cent of which was in Asia (Neue et al.,
1990).1
The measurements at various locations of the world show that there are
large temporal variations of CH4 fluxes and that the flux differs markedly
with soil type and texture, application of organic matter and mineral
fertiliser (Neue and Sass, 1994).  The wide variations in CH4 fluxes also
                                                     
     1 The term "harvested area" has a different meaning from "cultivated
area" in that the former accounts for double and triple cropping.  For
example, if a country has 10 million hectares of land under rice cultivation,
all of which are double-cropped (i.e., two crops of rice are grown on each
hectare each year), then this country has 20 million hectares of rice area
harvested annually.

indicate that the flux is critically dependent upon several factors including
climate, characteristics of soils and paddy, and agricultural practices,
particularly water regime.  The parameters that affect methane emissions
vary widely both spatially and temporally.  Multiple year data sets near the
same location and under similar conditions can lead to substantial differences
in seasonal methane emission levels, making it difficult to establish a single
number as the methane emission level from a field, let alone at a regional or
country level.  Thus, at the current level of understanding, a reported range
in methane emission levels for a country is more realistic than a single
number.

Area Statistics
Table 4-9 contains information on harvested area of rice according to
statistics from the FAO Yearbook (UN, 1992), China Agricultural Yearbook
(1990), IRRI RICE Almanac (IRRI, 1994) and World Rice Statistics (IRRI,
1993).  Allocation of areas to categories, e.g., irrigated, rainfed (flood prone
and lowland rainfed) and upland rice for main rice-producing countries were
based on the IRRI Rice Almanac (IRRI, 1994) and for other rice-producing
countries these categories were based on IRRI (1990), Huke (1982) and
Grist (1986).  Actual percentage of the irrigated, rainfed, and flood prone
areas which are continuously flooded or have an aeration period greater
than 3 days or multiple aerations, are to be obtained from the country
specific data.
Seasonally Integrated flux values
Tables 4-10 and 4-11 provides default emission factors, EF, for various
categories of water regimes and multiplication factors for organic
amendments.  Emissions from upland rice are assumed to be 0 and ignored
in the emission calculations.
See the Reference Manual for a more detailed discussion of available data
sources.
4 . 3 . 3  M e t h o d o l o g y
Emissions of methane from rice fields can be represented as follows:
EQUATION 1
Fc = EF × A × 10-12
where:
Fc
=
estimated annual emission of methane from a particular rice
water regime and for a given organic amendment, in Tg /yr;
EF
=
methane emission factor integrated over integrated cropping
season, in g/m2;
A
=
annual harvested area cultivated under conditions specified
above.  It is given by the cultivated area times the number of
cropping seasons per year, i.e., in m2/yr.
ESTIMATING HARVESTED AREA
The annual harvested area cultivated
under these conditions is given by
the cultivated area (in m2/yr) times
the number of cropping seasons per
year.  If some areas are double
cropped, they would be counted
twice as the harvested area.

Enter the Harvested Area by water management regime (in square
metres x 10-9) in column A.
The annual harvested area cultivated under these conditions is given by
the cultivated area (in m2/yr) times the number of cropping seasons per
year.  Area cultivated under upland (or dry conditions) is excluded from
methane calculations.  Table 4-9 provides some default information
which can be used if data are not locally available.  Note that the data
for area harvested provided in Table 4-9 are expressed in units of
thousands of hectares.  If these data are used they must first be
converted to square metres (1000h = 107 sq.m).
2
Enter the Scaling Factor for Methane Emissions in column B.  Default
factors are given for rice ecosystems relative to continuously flooded
fields, without organic amendments. Values are provided in Table 4-10
and can be used if more detailed data are not locally available.
3
For conversion to soils with organic amendment, enter a Correction
Factor for Organic Amendment  in column C.  The default value is 2.
For soils without organic amendment, correction is not necessary.  In
this case, enter 1 in column C.
4
Enter the Seasonally Integrated Methane Emission Factor for
Continuously Flooded Rice without Organic Amendment (in g/m2) in
column D.  Some country specific data are given in Table 4-11.  The
arithmetic mean of the dataset can be used as a default value, if no other
information is available.
5
For each category, multiply the Harvested Area (column A) by the
Scaling Factor for Methane Emissions (column B), the Correction Factor
for Organic Amendment (column C), and the Seasonally Integrated
Methane Emission Factor for Continuously Flooded Rice without
Organic Fertilisers (column D).  This gives CH4 Emissions in gigagrams
for each rice category.  Enter the result in column E.
6
Sum emissions and enter the total at the bottom of column E.
USING THE WORKSHEET
• 
Copy the Worksheet at the end
of this section to complete the
inventory.
• 
Keep 
the 
original 
of 
the
Worksheet blank so you can
make 
further 
copies 
if
necessary.
REFLECTING MORE DETAIL
If you have the necessary data, you
can sub-divide your data further to
account 
for 
different 
fertilising
practices.  Furthermore, if regional
variations in temperature, cultivation
practices, etc. justify it, calculations
can be done at sub-national regional
level.  In either case you should use
extra copies of the Worksheet and
label them clearly by subcategory or
region.  You should then aggregate
the results to provide a national
summary table from the basic
categories described in the method.
