4 FUGITIVE EMISSIONS 
4.1 
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM MINING, 
PROCESSING, STORAGE AND 
TRANSPORTATION OF COAL 
Intentional or unintentional release of greenhouse gases may occur during the extraction, processing and delivery 
of fossil fuels to the point of final use. These are known as fugitive emissions.  
4.1.1 
Overview and description of sources 
Fugitive emissions associated with coal can be considered in terms of the following broad categories.1 
4.1.1.1 
COAL MINING AND HANDLING 
The geological processes of coal formation also produce methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) may also be 
present in some coal seams. These are known collectively as seam gas, and remain trapped in the coal seam until 
the coal is exposed and broken during mining. CH4 is the major greenhouse gas emitted from coal mining and 
handling. 
The major stages for the emission of greenhouse gases for both underground and surface coal mines are: 
• 
Mining emissions – These emissions result from the liberation of stored gas during the breakage of coal, 
and the surrounding strata, during mining operations. 
• 
Post-mining emissions – Not all gas is released from coal during the process of coal breakage during 
mining. Emissions, during subsequent handling, processing and transportation of coal are termed post-
mining emissions. Therefore coal normally continues to emit gas even after it has been mined, although 
more slowly than during the coal breakage stage.  
• 
Low temperature oxidation - These emissions arise because once coal is exposed to oxygen in air, the coal 
oxidizes to produce CO2. However, the rate of formation of CO2 by this process is low. 
• 
Uncontrolled combustion – On occasions, when the heat produced by low temperature oxidation is trapped, 
the temperature rises and an active fire may result. This is commonly known as uncontrolled combustion and 
is the most extreme manifestation of oxidation. Uncontrolled combustion is characterised by rapid reactions, 
sometimes visible flames and rapid CO2 formation, and may be natural or anthropogenic. It is noted that 
uncontrolled combustion only due to coal exploitation activities is considered here. 
After mining has ceased, abandoned coal mines may also continue to emit methane. 
A brief description of some of the major processes that need to be accounted for in estimating emissions for the 
different types of coal mines follows: 
UNDERGROUND MINES 
Active Underground Coal Mines 
The following potential source categories for fugitive emissions for active underground coal mines are 
considered in this document: 
Seam gas emissions vented to the atmosphere from coal mine ventilation air and degasification systems 
• 
Post-mining emissions  
• 
Low temperature oxidation  
                                                           
1  Methods for determining emissions from peat extraction are described in Volume 4 AFOLU Chapter 7 ‘Wetlands’. 
 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.7 
• 
Uncontrolled combustion 
Coal mine ventilation air and degasification systems arise as follows: 
Coal Mine Ventilation Air  
Underground coal mines are normally ventilated by flushing air from the surface, through the underground 
tunnels in order to maintain a safe atmosphere. Ventilation air picks up the CH4 and CO2 released from the coal 
formations and transports these to the surface where they are emitted to atmosphere. The concentration of 
methane in the ventilation air is normally low, but the volume flow rate of ventilation air is normally large and 
therefore the methane emissions from this source can be very significant. 
Coal Mine Degasification Systems 
Degasification systems comprise wells drilled before, during, and after mining to drain gas (mainly CH4) from 
the coal seams that release gas into the mine workings. During active mining the major purpose of degasification 
is to maintain a safe working atmosphere for the coal miners, although the recovered gas may also be utilised as 
an energy source.  Degasification systems can also be used at abandoned underground coal mines to recover 
methane. The amount of methane recovered from coal mine degasification systems can be very significant and is 
accounted for, depending on its final use, as described in Section 4.1.3.2 of this chapter.  
Abandoned Underground Mines 
After closure, coal mines that were significant methane emitters during mining operations continue to emit 
methane unless there is flooding that cuts off the emissions. Even if the mines have been sealed, methane may 
still be emitted to the atmosphere as a result of gas migrating through natural or manmade conduits such as old 
portals, vent pipes, or cracks and fissures in the overlying strata. Emissions quickly decline until they reach a 
near-steady rate that may persist for an extended period of time.  
Abandoned mines may flood as a result of intrusion of groundwater or surface water into the mine void. These 
mines typically continue to emit gas for a few years before the mine becomes completely flooded and the water 
prevents further methane release to the atmosphere. Emissions from completely flooded abandoned mines can be 
treated as negligible. Mines that remain partially flooded can continue to produce methane emissions over a long 
period of time, as with mines that do not flood.   
A further potential source of emissions occurs when some of the coal from abandoned mines ignites through the 
mechanism of uncontrolled combustion.  However, there are currently no methodologies for estimating potential 
emissions from uncontrolled combustion at abandoned underground mines. 
SURFACE COAL MINES 
Active Surface Mines  
The potential source categories for surface mining considered in this chapter are:  
• 
Methane and CO2 emitted during mining from breakage of coal and associated strata and leakage from 
the pit floor and highwall 
• 
Post-mining emissions  
• 
Low temperature oxidation 
• 
Uncontrolled combustion in waste dumps 
Emissions from surface coal mining occur because the mined and surrounding seams may also contain methane 
and CO2. Although the gas contents are generally less than for deeper underground coal seams, the emission of 
seam gas from surface mines needs to be taken into account, particularly for countries where this mining method 
is widely practised. In addition to seam gas emissions, the waste coal that is dumped into overburden or reject 
dumps may generate CO2, either by low temperature oxidation or by uncontrolled combustion.  
Abandoned Surface Mines  
After closure, abandoned or decommissioned surface mines may continue to emit methane as the gas leaks from 
the coal seams that were broken or damaged during mining. There are at present no methods for estimating 
emissions from this source.

Methodological issues 
The following sections focus on methane emissions, as this gas is the most important fugitive emission for coal 
mining. CO2 emissions should also be included in the inventory where data are available.  
UNDERGROUND MINING 
Fugitive emissions from underground mining arise from both ventilation and degasification systems. These 
emissions are normally emitted at a small number of centralised locations and can be considered as point sources. 
They are amenable to standard measurement methods.  
SURFACE MINING 
For surface mining the emissions of greenhouse gases are generally dispersed over sections of the mine and are 
best considered area sources. These emissions may be the result of seam gases emitted through the processes of 
breakage of the coal and overburden, low temperature oxidation of waste coal or low quality coal in dumps, and 
uncontrolled combustion. Measurement methods for low temperature oxidation and uncontrolled combustion are 
still being developed and therefore estimation methods are not included in this chapter. 
ABANDONED MINES 
Abandoned underground mines present difficulties in estimating emissions, although a methodology for 
abandoned underground mines is included in this chapter. Methodologies do not yet exist for abandoned or 
decommissioned surface mines, and therefore they are not included in this chapter. 
METHANE RECOVERY AND UTILISATION  
Methane recovered from drainage, ventilation air, or abandoned mines may be mitigated in two ways: (1) direct 
utilization as a natural gas resource or (2) by flaring to produce CO2, which has a lower global warming potential 
than methane.    
TIERS 
Use of appropriate tiers to develop emissions estimates for coal mining in accordance with good practice 
depends on the quality of data available. For instance, if limited data are available and the category is not key, 
then Tier 1 is good practice. The Tier 1 approach requires that countries choose from a global average range of 
emission factors and use country-specific activity data to calculate total emissions. Tier 1 is associated with the 
highest level of uncertainty. The Tier 2 approach uses country- or basin-specific emission factors that represent 
the average values for the coals being mined. These values are normally developed by each country, where 
appropriate. The Tier 3 approach uses direct measurements on a mine-specific basis and, properly applied, has 
the lowest level of uncertainty. 
4.1.3 
Underground coal mines 
The general form of the equation for estimating emissions for Tier 1 and 2 approaches, based on coal production 
activity data from underground coal mining and post-mining emissions is given by Equation 4.1.1 below. 
Methods to estimate emissions from abandoned underground mines, included in the guidelines for the first time, 
are described in detail in Section 4.1.5. 
Equation 4.1.1 represents emissions before adjustment for any utilisation or flaring of recovered gas: 
EQUATION 4.1.1 
ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM UNDERGROUND COAL MINES FOR TIER 1 AND TIER 2 WITHOUT 
ADJUSTMENT FOR METHANE UTILISATION OR FLARING 
Greenhouse gas emissions = Raw coal production●Emission Factor● Units conversion factor 
 
The definition of the Emission Factor used in this equation depends on the activity data used. For Tier 1 and Tier 
2, the Emission Factor for underground, surface and post-mining emissions has units of m3tonne-1, the same 
units as in situ gas content. This is because these Emission Factors are used with activity data on raw coal 
production which has mass units (i.e. tonnes). However, the Emission Factor and the in situ gas content are not 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.10 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
the same and should not be confused. The Emission Factor is always larger than the in situ gas content, because 
the gas released during mining draws from a larger volume of coal and adjacent gas-bearing strata than simply 
the volume of coal produced. For abandoned underground mines, the Emission Factor has different units, 
because of the different methodologies employed, see section 4.1.5 for greater detail. 
The equation to be used along with Equation 4.1.1 in order to adjust for methane utilisation and flaring for Tier 1 
and Tier 2 approaches is shown in Equation 4.1.2. 
EQUATION 4.1.2 
 ESTIMATING EMISSIONS FROM UNDERGROUND COAL MINES  FOR TIER 1 AND TIER 2 WITH 
ADJUSTMENT FOR METHANE UTILISATION OR FLARING  
CH4 emissions from underground mining activities = Emissions from underground mining CH4 + 
Post-mining emission of CH4 – CH4 recovered and utilized for energy production or flared 
 
Emissions from underground mines in equations 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 include abandoned mines (see section 4.1.5) and 
both go into the total for 1.B. 1.a.i (Underground mines). 
Equation 4.1.2 is used for Tiers 1 and 2 because they use Emission Factors to account for emissions from coal 
mines on a national or coal-basin level. The emission factors already include all the methane likely to be released 
from mining activities. Thus, any methane recovery and utilization must be explicitly accounted for by the 
subtraction term in Equation 4.1.2. Tier 3 methods involve mine-specific calculations which take into account 
the methane drained and recovered from individual mines rather than emission factors, and therefore Equation 
4.1.2 is not appropriate for Tier 3 methods. 
4.1.3.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
UNDERGROUND MINING 
Figure 4.1.1 shows the decision tree for underground coal mining activities. For countries with underground 
mining, and where mine-specific measurement data are available it is good practice to use a Tier 3 method. 
Mine-specific data, based on ventilation air measurements and degasification system measurements, reflect 
actual emissions on a mine-by-mine basis, and therefore produce a more accurate estimate than using Emission 
Factors.  
Hybrid Tier 3 - Tier 2 approaches are appropriate in situations when mine-specific measurement data are 
available only for a subset of underground mines. For example, if only mines that are considered gassy report 
data, emissions from the remaining mines can be calculated with Tier 2 emission factors.  The definition of what 
constitutes a gassy mine will be determined by each country. For instance, in the United States, gassy mines 
refers to coal mines with average annual ventilation emissions exceeding the range of 2 800 to 14 000 cubic 
meters per day.  Emission factors can be based on specific emission rates derived from Tier 3 data if the mines 
are operating within the same basin as the Tier 3 mines, or on the basis of mine-specific properties, such as the 
average depth of the coal mines. 
When no mine-by-mine data are available, but country- or basin-specific data are, it is good practice to employ 
the Tier 2 method. 
Where no data (or very limited data) are available, it is good practice to use a Tier 1 approach, provided 
underground coal mining is not a key sub source category. If it is, then it is good practice to obtain emissions 
data to increase the accuracy of these emissions estimates (see Figure 4.1.1). 
POST-MINING 
Direct measurement (Tier 3) of all post-mining emissions is not feasible, so an emission factor approach must be 
used. The Tier 2 and Tier 1 methods described below represent good practice for this source, given the difficulty 
of obtaining better data. 
LOW TEMPERATURE OXIDATION 
Oxidation of coal when it is exposed to the atmosphere by coal mining releases CO2. This source will usually be 
insignificant when compared with the total emissions from gassy underground coal mines. Consequently, no 
methods are provided to estimate it. Where there are significant emissions of CO2 in addition to methane in the 
seam gas, these should be reported on a mine-specific basis.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS FOR UNDERGROUND MINES 
MINING 
Tier 1 Emission Factors for underground mining are shown below. The emission factors are the same as those 
described in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (BCTSRE, 1992; 
Bibler et al, 1991; Lama, 1992; Pilcher et al, 1991;USEPA, 1993a,b and Zimmermeyer, 1989).

This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67 ● 10-6 Gg m-3.  
Countries using the Tier 1 approach should consider country-specific variables such as the depth of major coal 
seams to determine the emission factor to be used. As gas content of coal usually increases with depth, the low 
end of the range should be chosen for average mining depths of <200 m, and for depths of > 400 m the high 
value is appropriate. For intermediate depths, average values can be used. 
For countries using a Tier 2 approach, basin-specific emission factors may be obtained from sample ventilation 
air data or from a quantitative relationship that accounts for the gas content of the coal seam and the surrounding 
strata affected by the mining process, along with raw coal production. For a typical longwall operation, the 
amount of gas released comes from the coal being extracted and from any other gas-bearing strata that are 
located within 150 m above and 50 m below the mined seam (Good Practice Guidance, 2000). 
POST-MINING EMISSIONS 
For a Tier 1 approach the post-mining emissions factors are shown below together with the estimation method: 
EQUATION 4.1.4  
TIER 1: GLOBAL AVERAGE METHOD – POST-MINING EMISSIONS – UNDERGROUND MINES

Conversion Factor: 
This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67●10-6 Gg m-3. 
Tier 2 methods to estimate post-mining emissions take into account the in situ gas content of the coal. 
Measurements on coal as it emerges on a conveyor from an underground mine without degasification prior to 
mining indicate that 25-40 percent of the in situ gas remains in the coal (Williams and Saghafi, 1993). For mines 
that practice pre-drainage, the amount of gas in coal will be less than the in situ value by some unknown amount. 
For mines with no pre-drainage, but with knowledge of the in situ gas content, the post-mining emission factor 
can be set at 30 percent of the in situ gas content. For mines with pre-drainage, an emission factor of 10 percent 
of the in situ gas content is suggested. 
Tier 3 methods are not regarded as feasible for post-mining operations.  
EMISSIONS FROM DRAINED METHANE  
Methane drained from working (or abandoned) underground (or surface) coal mines can be vented directly to the 
atmosphere, recovered and utilised, or converted to CO2 through combustion (flaring or catalytic oxidation) 
without any utilisation. The manner of accounting for drained methane varies, depending on the final use of the 
methane. 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.13 
In general: 
• 
Tier 1 represents an aggregate emissions estimate using emission factors. In general, it is not expected that 
emissions associated with drained methane would be applicable for Tier 1. Presumably, if methane were 
being drained, there would be better data to enable use of Tier 2 or even Tier 3 methods to make emissions 
estimates. However, Tier 1 has been included in the discussion below, in case Tier 1 methods are being used 
to estimate national emissions where there are methane drainage operations.  
• 
When methane is drained from coal seams as part of coal mining and subsequently flared or used as a fuel, it 
is good practice to subtract this amount from the total estimate of methane emissions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 
(Equation 4.1.2). Data on the amount of methane that is flared or otherwise utilised should be obtained from 
mine operators with the same frequency of measurement as pertains to underground mine emissions 
generally. 
• 
For Tiers 1 and 2, if methane is drained and vented to the atmosphere rather than utilized, it should not be 
re-counted as it already forms part of the emissions estimates for these approaches. 
• 
For Tier 3, methane recovered from degasification systems and vented to the atmosphere prior to mining 
should be added to the amount of methane released through ventilation systems so that the total estimate is 
complete. In some cases, because degasification system data are considered confidential, it may be necessary 
to estimate degasification system collection efficiency, and then subtract known reductions to arrive at the 
net degasification system emissions. 
• 
All methane emissions associated with coal seam degasification related to coal mining activities should be 
accounted for in the inventory year in which the emissions and recovery operations occur. Thus, the total 
emissions from all ventilation shafts and from all degasification operations that emit methane to the 
atmosphere are reported for each year, regardless of when the coal seam is mined through, as long as the 
emissions are associated with mining activities. This represents a departure from the previous guidelines 
where the drained methane was accounted for in the year in which the coal seam was mined through. 
When recovered methane is utilized as an energy source: 
• 
Any emissions resulting from use of recovered coal mine methane as an energy source should be accounted 
for based on its final end-use, for example in the Energy Volume, Chapter 2, ‘Stationary Combustion’ when 
used for stationary energy production.  
• 
Where recovered methane from coal seams is fed into a gas distribution system and used as natural gas, the 
fugitive emissions are dealt with in the oil and natural gas source category (Section 4.2).  
When recovered methane is flared: 
• 
When the methane is simply combusted with no useful energy, as in flaring or catalytic oxidation to CO2, 
the corresponding CO2 production should be added to the total greenhouse gas emissions (expressed as CO2 
equivalents) from coal mining activities. Such emissions should be accounted for as shown by Equation 
4.1.5, below. Amounts of nitrous oxide and non-methane volatile organic compounds emitted during flaring 
will be small relative to the overall fugitive emissions and need not be estimated.

4.14 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.1.3.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The activity data required for Tiers 1 and 2 are raw coal production. If the data on raw coal production are 
available these should be used directly. If coal is not sent to a coal preparation plant or washery for upgrading by 
removal of some of the mineral matter, then raw coal production equals the amount of saleable coal. Where coal 
is upgraded, some coal is rejected in the form of coarse discards containing high mineral matter and also in the 
form of unrecoverable fines. The amount of waste is typically around 20 percent of the weight of raw coal feed, 
but may vary considerably by country. Where activity data are in the form of saleable coal, an estimate should be 
made of the amount of production that is washed. Raw coal production is then estimated by increasing the 
amount of ‘saleable coal’ by the fraction lost through washing.  
An alternative approach that may be more suitable for mines whose raw coal output contains rock from the roof 
or floor as a deliberate part of the extraction process, is to use saleable coal data in conjunction with emission 
factors referenced to the clean fraction of the coal, not raw coal. This should be noted in the inventory. 
For the Tier 3 methods, coal production data are unnecessary because actual emissions measurements are 
available. However, it is good practice to collect and report these data to illustrate the relationship, if any, 
between underground coal production and actual emissions on an annual basis. 
High quality measurements of methane drained by degasification systems should also be available from mine 
operators for mines where drainage is practised. If detailed data on drainage rates are absent, good practice is to 
obtain data on the efficiency of the systems (i.e. the fraction of gas drained) or to make an estimate using a range 
(e.g. 30-50 percent, typical of many degasification systems). If associated mines have data available these may 
also be used to provide guidance. Annual total gas production records for previous years should be maintained; 
these records may be available from appropriate agencies or from individual mines.   
Where data on methane recovery from coal mines and utilisation are not directly available from mine operators, 
gas sales could be used as a proxy. If gas sales are unavailable, the alternative is to estimate the amount of 
utilised methane from the known efficiency specifications of the drainage system. Only methane that would have 
been emitted from coal mining activities should be considered as recovered and utilized. These emissions should 
be accounted for in Volume 2, Chapter 4, Section 4.2, ‘Fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas’, or if the 
emissions are combusted for energy, in Volume 2, Chapter 2 ‘Stationary Combustion’. 
4.1.3.4 
COMPLETENESS FOR UNDERGROUND COAL MINES 
The estimate of emissions from underground mining should include: 
• 
Drained gas produced from degasification systems  
• 
Ventilation emissions 
• 
Post-mining emissions 
• 
Estimates of volume of methane recovered and utilized or flared 
• 
Abandoned underground coal mines (see Section 4.1.5 for methodological guidance) 
These sub sources categories are included in the current Guidelines. 
4.1.3.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Comprehensive mine-by-mine (i.e. Tier 3) data may be available for some but not all years. If there have been no 
major changes in the number of active mines, emissions can be scaled to production for missing years, if any. If 
there were changes in the mine number, the mines involved can be removed from the scaling extrapolation and 
handled separately. However, care must be taken in scaling because the coal being mined, the virgin exposed 
coal and the disturbed mining zone each have different emission rates. Furthermore, mines may have a high 
background emission level that is independent of production. 
The inventory guidelines recommend that methane emissions associated with coal seam degasification related to 
mining should be accounted for in the inventory year in which the emissions and recovery operations occur. This 
is a departure from previous guidelines which suggested that the methane emissions or reductions only be 
accounted for during the year in which the coal was produced (e.g. the degasification wells were “mined 
through.”) Thus, if feasible, re-calculation of previous inventory years is desirable to make a consistent time 
series.  
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.15 
In cases where an inventory compiler moves from a Tier 1 or Tier 2 to a Tier 3 method, it may be necessary to 
calculate implied emissions factors for years with measurement data, and apply these emission factors to coal 
production for years in which these data do not exist. It is important to consider if the composition of the mine 
population has changed dramatically during the interim period, because this could introduce uncertainty. For 
mines that have been abandoned since 1990, data may not be archived if the company disappears. These mines 
should be treated separately when adjusting the time series for consistency.  
For situations where the emissions of greenhouse gases from active underground mines have been well 
characterized and the mines have passed from being considered 'active' to 'abandoned', care should be  taken so 
as not to introduce  major discontinuities in the total emissions record from coal mining. 
4.1.3.6 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT  
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Emission Factors for Tiers 1 and 2 
The major sources of uncertainty for a Tier 1 approach arise from two sources. These are:  
• 
The applicability of global emission factors to individual countries   
• 
Inherent uncertainties in the emission factors themselves 
The uncertainty due to the first point above is difficult to quantify, but could be significant. The inherent 
uncertainty in the emission factor is also difficult to quantify because of natural variability within the same coal 
region is known to occur.  
For a Tier 2 approach, the same broad comments apply, although basin-specific data will reduce the inherent 
uncertainty in the Emission Factor compared with a Tier 1 approach. With regard to the inherent variability in 
the Emission Factor, ‘Expert Judgement’ in the Good Practice Guidance (2000) suggested that this was likely to 
be at least ±50 percent.  
Table 4.1.2 shows the Tier 1 and Tier 2 uncertainties associated with emissions from underground coal mining. 
The uncertainties for these Tiers are based on expert judgement.

 (2000) 
Tier 3  
Methane emissions from underground mines have a significant natural variability due to variations in the rate of 
mining and drainage of gas. For instance, the gas liberated by longwall mining can vary by a factor of up to two 
during the life of a longwall panel. Frequent measurements of underground mine emissions can account for such 
variability and also reduce the intrinsic errors in the measurement techniques. As emissions vary over the course 
of a year due to variations in coal production rate and associated drainage, good practice is to collect 
measurement data as frequently as practical, preferably biweekly or monthly to smooth out variations. Daily 
measurements would ensure a higher quality estimate. Continuous monitoring of emissions represents the 
highest stage of emission monitoring, and is implemented in some modern longwall mines. 
Spot measurements of methane concentration in ventilation air are probably accurate to ±20 percent depending 
on the equipment used. Time series data or repeat measurements will significantly reduce the uncertainty of 
annual emissions to ±5 percent for continuous monitoring, and 10-15 percent for monitoring conducted every 
two weeks. Ventilation airflows are usually fairly accurately known (±2 percent). When combining the 
inaccuracies in emissions concentration measurements with the imprecision due to measurement and calculation 
of instantaneous measurements, overall emissions for an individual mine may be under-represented by as much 
as 10 percent or over-represented by as much as 30 percent (Mutmansky and Wang, 2000).  
Volume 2: Energy 
4.16 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Spot measurement of methane concentration in drained gas (from degasification systems) is likely to be accurate 
to ±2 percent because of its higher concentration. Measurements should be made with a frequency comparable to 
those for ventilation air to obtain representative sampling. Measured degasification flowrates are probably 
known to be ±5 percent. Degasification flowrates that are estimated based on gas sales are also likely to have an 
uncertainty of at least ±5 percent due to the tolerances in pipeline gas quality.  
For a single longwall operation, with continuous or daily emission measurements, the accuracy of monthly or 
annual average emissions data is probably ±5 percent. The accuracy of spot measurements performed every two 
weeks is ±10 percent, at 3-monthly intervals: ±30 percent. Aggregating emissions from mines based on the less 
frequent type of measurement procedures will reduce the uncertainty caused by fluctuations in gas production. 
However, as fugitive emissions are often dominated by contributions from only a small number of mines, it is 
difficult to estimate the extent of this improvement. 
The uncertainty estimates for underground mines are shown in Table 4.1.3.

ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Coal production: Country-specific tonnages are likely to be known to 1-2 percent, but if raw coal data are not 
available, then the uncertainty will increase to about ±5 percent, when converting from saleable coal production 
data. The data are also influenced by moisture content, which is usually present at levels between 5-10 percent, 
and may not be determined with great accuracy. 
Apart from measurement uncertainty, there can be further uncertainties introduced by the nature of the statistical 
databases that are not considered here. In countries with a mix of regulated and unregulated mines, activity data 
may have an uncertainty of ±10 percent

EQUATION 4.1.6  
GENERAL EQUATION FOR ESTIMATING FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM SURFACE COAL MINING 
CH4 emissions = Surface mining emissions of CH4 + Post-mining emission of CH4  
4.1.4.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD  
It is not yet feasible to collect mine-specific Tier 3 measurement data for surface mines. The alternative is to 
collect data on surface mine coal production and use emission factors. For countries with significant coal 
production and multiple coal basins, disaggregation of data and emission factors to the coal basin level will 
improve accuracy. Given the uncertainty of production-based emission factors, choosing emission factors from 
the range specified within these guidelines can provide reasonable estimates for a Tier 1 approach.  
As with underground mining, direct measurement of post-mining emissions is infeasible so an emission factor 
approach is recommended. Tier 2 and Tier 1 methods should be reasonable for this source, given the difficulty of 
obtaining better data.  
Oxidation of coal in the atmosphere to produce CO2 is known to occur at surface mines, but emissions from this 
are not expected to be significant, especially taking into account the effects of rehabilitation of the waste dumps. 
Rehabilitation practices, which involve covering the dumps with topsoil and re-vegetation, act to reduce oxygen 
fluxes into the dump and hence reduce the rate of CO2 production.  
Uncontrolled combustion in waste piles is a feature for some surface mines. However, these emissions, where 
they occur, are extremely difficult to quantify and it is infeasible to include a methodology.

EMISSION FACTORS FOR SURFACE MINING 
Although measurements of methane emissions from surface mining are increasingly available, they are difficult 
to make and at present no routine widely applicable methods exist. Data on in situ gas contents before 
overburden removal are also scarce for many surface mining operations.  
The Tier 1 emission factors are shown together with the estimation method in Equation 4.1.7.

This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of  0.67 ● 10-6 Gg m-3.  
For the Tier 1 approach, it is good practice to use the low end of the specific emission range for those mines with 
average overburden depths of less than 25 meters and the high end for overburden depths over 50 meters. For 
intermediate depths, average values for the emission factors may be used. In the absence of data on overburden 
thickness, it is good practice to use the average emission factor, namely 1.2 m3/tonne.  
The Tier 2 method uses the same equation as for Tier 1, but with data disaggregated to the coal basin level. 
POST-MINING EMISSIONS – SURFACE MINING 
For a Tier 1 approach the post-mining emissions can be estimated using the emission factors shown in Equation

high emission factor. 
4.1.4.3 
ACTIVITY DATA 
As with underground coal mines, the activity data required for Tiers 1 and 2 are raw coal production. The 
comments relating to coal production data, made for Tier 1 and Tier 2 for underground mining in Section 4.1.3.3 
also apply to surface mining. 
4.1.4.4 
COMPLETENESS FOR SURFACE MINING 
The estimate of emissions from surface mining should include: 
• 
Emissions during mining through the breaking of coal and from surrounding strata  
• 
Post-mining emissions  
• 
Waste pile/ overburden dump fires 
At present only the first two sources above are taken into account. While there will be some emissions from low 
temperature oxidation, these are expected to be insignificant for this source.  
4.1.4.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
There may be missing inventory data for surface mines for certain inventory years. If there have been no major 
changes in the number of active surface mines, emissions can be scaled to production for the missing years. If 
there were changes in the number of mines, the mines involved can be removed from the scaling extrapolation 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.20

and handled separately. Where new mines have started production in new coalfields, it is important that the 
emissions applicable to these mines be assessed as each coal basin will have different characteristic in situ gas 
contents and emission rates.  
If coal seam degasification is practiced at surface mines, the methane should be estimated and reported in the 
inventory year in which the emissions and recovery operations occur.  
4.1.4.6 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT IN EMISSIONS 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTY 
Uncertainties in the emissions from surface mines are less well quantified than for underground mining. Briefly, 
the sources of the uncertainty are the same as described in Section 4.1.3.6 for underground coal mines. However, 
the variability in the emission factors for large surface mines may be expected to be greater than for underground 
coal mines, because surface mines can show significant variability across the extent of the mine as a result of 
local geological features.   
Table 4.1.4 shows the Tier 1 and Tier 2 uncertainties associated with surface mining emissions.

4.1.5 
Abandoned underground coal mines 
Closed, or abandoned, underground coal mines may continue to be a source of greenhouse gas emissions for 
some time after the mines have been closed or decommissioned. For the purpose of the emissions inventory, it is 
critical that each mine is classified in one and only one inventory database (e.g., active or abandoned). 
As abandoned mines appear in these guidelines for the first time, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches are described 
in some detail. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches presented below are largely based on an approach originally 
developed by the USEPA (Franklin et al, 2004) and have been adapted to be more globally applicable. It is 
anticipated that, where country-specific data exists for abandoned mines, the country-specific data will be used. 
The Tier 3 approach provides flexibility for use of mine-specific data. The Tier 3 methodology outlined below 
has been adapted from the USA methodology (Franklin et al 2004; US EPA 2004). Other relevant work has been 
sponsored by the UK (Kershaw, 2005), which provides another example of a Tier 3 approach.

Developing emissions estimates from abandoned underground coal mines requires historical records. Figure 
4.1.3 is a decision tree that shows how to determine which Tier to use.  
Tier 1 and 2 
  
The two key parameters used to estimate abandoned mine emissions for each mine (or group of mines) are the 
time (in years) elapsed since the mine was abandoned, relative to the year of the emissions inventory, and 
emission factors that take into account the mine’s gassiness. If applicable and appropriate, methane recovery at 
specific mines can be incorporated for specific mines in a hybrid Tier 2 – Tier 3 approach (see below). 
• 
Tier 2 incorporates coal-type-specific information and narrower time intervals for abandonment of coal 
mines. 
• 
Tier 1 includes default values and broader time intervals. 
For a Tier 1 approach, the emissions for a given inventory year can be calculated from Equation 4.1.10.

and post-mining emissions. This is because of the different method for estimating emissions from 
abandoned mines compared with underground or surface mining. 
This equation is applied for each time interval, and emissions from each time interval are added to calculate the 
total emissions. 
Conversion Factor: 
This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67●10-6 Gg m-3.

Tier 3 
The Tier 3 approaches (Franklin et al, 2004 and Kershaw, 2005) require mine-specific information such as 
ventilation emissions from the mine when active, characteristics of the mined coal seam, mine size and depth, 
and the condition of the abandoned mine (e.g., hydrologic status, flooding or flooded, and whether sealed or 
vented). Each country may generate its own profiles of abandoned mine emissions as a function of time (also 
known as emission decline curves) based on known national- or basin-specific coal properties, or it may use 
more generic curves based on coal rank, or measurements possibly in combination with mathematical modelling 
methods. If there are any methane recovery projects occurring at abandoned mines, data on these projects are 
expected to be available. A mine-specific Tier 3 methodology would be appropriate for calculating emissions 
from a mine that has associated methane recovery projects and could be incorporated as part of a hybrid 
approach with a national level Tier 2 emissions inventory. 
In general, the Tier 3 process for developing a national inventory of abandoned mine methane (AMM) emissions 
consists of the following steps: 
1. Creating a database of gassy abandoned coal mines. 
2. Identifying key factors affecting methane emissions: hydrologic (flooding) status, permeability mine 
condition (whether sealed or vented) and time elapsed since abandonment. 
3.  Developing mine- or coal basin-specific emission rate decline curves, or equivalent models. 
4. Validating mathematical models through a field measurement programme. 
5. Calculating a national emissions inventory for each year.  
6. Adjusting for emissions reductions due to methane recovery and utilization. 
7. Determining the net total emissions. 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.23 
Hybrid Approaches 
A combination of different Tier methodologies may be used to reflect the best data availability for different 
historical periods. For example, for a given country, emissions from mines abandoned in the distant past may 
need to be determined using a Tier 1 method. For that same country, it may be possible to determine emissions 
from mines abandoned more recently using a Tier 2 or 3 method if more accurate data are available.  
Fully Flooded Mines   
It is good practice to include mines that are known to be fully flooded in databases and other records used for 
inventory development, but they should be assigned an emission of zero as the emissions from such mines are 
negligible. 
Emissions Reductions through Recovery and Utilization 
In some cases, methane from closed or abandoned mines may be recovered and utilised or flared. Methane 
recovery from abandoned mines generally entails pumping which increases, or “accelerates”, the amount of 
methane recovered above the amount that would have been emitted had pumping not taken place. 
Under a mine-specific (Tier 3) approach in which emissions decline curves or models are used to estimate 
emissions, if emissions reductions are less than the projected emissions that would have occurred at the mine had 
recovery not taken place for a given year, then the emissions reductions from the recovery and utilization should 
be subtracted from the projected emissions to provide the net emissions. If the methane recovered and utilized in 
a given year exceeds the emission that would have occurred had recovery not taken place, then the net emissions 
from that mine for that year are considered to be zero. 
If a Tier 3 method is not used (singly or in combination with Tier 2), the total amount of methane recovered and 
utilized from abandoned mines should be subtracted from the total emissions inventory for abandoned mines, per 
Equation 4.1.9, subject to the reported emissions being no less than zero. The Tier 3 method should be used 
where suitable data are available. 
4.1.5.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1: Global Average Approach – Abandoned Underground Mines 
A Tier 1 approach for determining emissions from abandoned underground mines is described below and is 
largely based on methods developed by the USEPA (Franklin et al , 2004). It incorporates a factor to account for 
the fraction of those mines that, when they were actively producing coal, were considered gassy. Thus, this 
methodology is based on the total number of coal mines abandoned, adjusted for the fraction considered gassy, 
as described below. Abandoned mines that were considered non-gassy when they were actively mined are 
presumed to have negligible emissions. In the US methodology, the term gassy mines refers to coal mines that, 
when they were active, had average annual ventilation emissions that exceeded the range of 2 800 to 14 000 
cubic meters per day (m3/d), or 0.7 to 3.4 Gg per year. 
The Tier 1 – approach for abandoned underground coal mines is as follows: 
1. Determine the approximate time (year interval) from the following time intervals when gassy coal 
mines were abandoned: 
a. 
1901 – 1925 
b. 1926 – 1950 
c. 
1951 – 1975 
d. 1976 – 2000 
e. 
2001 - present 
 
2. Multiple intervals may be used where appropriate. It is recommended that the number of gassy coal 
mines abandoned during each time interval be estimated using the smallest time intervals possible based 
on available data. Ideally, for more recent periods, time intervals will decrease (e.g., intervals of ten 
years prior to 1990; annual intervals since 1990). Information for different coal mine-clusters 
abandoned during different time periods should be considered, since multiple time periods may be 
combined in the Tier 1 approach  
3. Estimate the total number of abandoned mines in each time band since 1901 remaining unflooded. If 
there is no knowledge on the extent of flooding it is good practice to assume that 100 percent of mines 
remain unflooded. For the purposes of estimating the number of abandoned mines, prospect excavations 
and hand cart mines of only a few acres in size should be disregarded. 
4. Determine the percentage of coal mines that would be considered gassy at the time of mine closure. 
Based on the time intervals selected above, choose an estimated percentage of gassy coal mines from 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.24 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
the high and low default values listed in Table 4.1.5. Actual estimates can range anywhere from 0 to 
100 percent. When choosing within the high and low default values listed in Table 4.1.5, a country 
should consider all available historical information that may contribute to the percentage of gassy mines, 
such as coal rank, gas content, and depth of mining. Countries with recorded instances of gassy mines 
(e.g., methane explosions or outbursts) should choose the high default values in the early part of the 
century. From 1926 to 1975, countries where mines were relatively deep and hydraulic equipment was 
used should choose the high default value. Countries with deep longwall mines or with evidence of 
gassiness should choose the high values for the time periods after 1975. The low range of the default 
values may be appropriate for a given time interval for specific regions, coal basins, or nations, based 
on geologic conditions or known mining practices.  
5. For the inventory year of interest (between 1990 and the present), select the appropriate emissions 
factor from Table 4.1.6. For example, for mines abandoned in the interval 1901 to 1925 and for the 
inventory reporting year 2005, the Emission Factor for these mines would have a value of 0.256 million 
m3 of methane per mine. 
6. Calculate for each time band the total methane emissions from Equation 4.1.10 to the inventory year of 
interest. 
7. Sum the emissions for each time interval to derive the total abandoned mine emissions for each 
inventory year.

Tier 2 – Country- or Basin-Specific Approach 
The Tier 2 approach for developing an abandoned mine methane emission inventory follows a similar approach 
to Tier 1, but it incorporates country- or basin-specific data. The methodology presented below is intended to 
utilize coal basin-specific or country-specific data wherever possible (for example, for active mine emissions 
prior to abandonment, for basin-specific parameters for emissions factors, etc.). 
In some cases, default parameters have been provided for these values but these should be used only if country-
specific or basin-specific data are not available. 
Calculate emissions for a given inventory year using Equation 4.1.11: 
EQUATION 4.1.11 
TIER 2 APPROACH FOR ABANDONED UNDERGROUND MINES WITHOUT METHANE RECOVERY AND 
UTILIZATION  
Methane Emissions    = Number of Coal Mines Abandoned Remaining Unflooded ● Fraction of 
Gassy Mines ● Average Emissions Rate ● Emission Factor ● Conversion Factor 
Where units are: 
Emissions of methane (Gg year-1) 
Emission Rate (m3 year-1 ) 
Emission Factor (dimensionless, see Equation 4.1.12)  
Conversion Factor: 
This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67●10-6 Gg m-3 
If individual mines are known to be completely flooded, they may be assigned an emissions value of zero. 
Methane emissions reductions due to recovery projects that utilize or flare methane at abandoned mines should 
be subtracted from the emissions estimate. For either of these cases, it is recommended that a hybrid Tier 2 – 
Tier 3 approach be used to incorporate such mine-specific information (see the discussion of methane recovery 
and utilization projects from abandoned mines, Sections 4.1.5.1 and 4.1.5.3). 
The basic steps in the Tier 2 approach for abandoned underground coal mines are as follows: 
• 
Determine the approximate time interval(s) when significant numbers of gassy coal mines were closed. 
Multiple intervals may be used where appropriate. It is recommended that the number of gassy coal mines 
abandoned during each time interval be estimated using the smallest time intervals possible based on 
available data. Ideally, for more recent periods, time intervals will decrease (e.g., intervals of ten years prior 
to 1990; annual intervals since 1990). 
• 
Estimate the total number of abandoned mines in each time interval selected remaining unflooded. If there is 
no available information on the flooded status of the abandoned mines, assume 100 percent remain 
unflooded. 
• 
Determine the number (or percentage) of coal mines that would be considered gassy at the time of mine 
closure. 
• 
For each time interval, determine the average emissions rate.  If country or basin-specific data do not exist, 
low and high estimates for active mine emissions prior to abandonment can be selected from Table 4.1.8.   
• 
For each time interval, calculate an appropriate emissions factor using Equation 4.1.12, based on the 
difference in years between the estimated data of abandonment and the year of the emissions inventory. Note 
that default values for this emissions factor equation are provided in Table 4.1.9, but these default values 
should be used only where country- or basin-specific information are not available. 
• 
Calculate the emissions for each time interval using Equation 4.1.11. 
• 
Sum the emissions for each time interval to derive the total abandoned mine emissions for each inventory 
year.

Tier 3-Mine-Specific Approach 
Tier 3 provides a great deal of flexibility. Directly measured emissions, where available, can be used in place of 
estimates and calculations. Models may be used in conjunction with measured data to estimate time series 
emissions. Each country may generate their own decline curves or other characterizations based on 
measurements, known basin-specific coal properties, and/or hydrological models. Equation 4.1.13 describes one 
possible, approach.

The basic steps in the Tier 3 methodology involve the following: 
• 
Determine a database of mine closures with relevant geological and hydrological information and the 
approximate abandonment dates (when all active mine ventilation ceased) consistently for all mines in the 
country’s inventory. 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.28 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• 
Estimate emissions based on measured emissions and/or an emissions model. This may be based on the 
average emission rate at time of mine closure, determined by the last measured emission rate (or preferably, 
an average of several measurements taken the year prior to abandonment), or estimated methane reserves 
susceptible to release. 
• 
If actual measurements have not been taken at a given mine, emissions may be calculated using an 
appropriate decline curve or modelling approach for openly vented mines, sealed mines, or flooded mines. 
Use the selected decline equation or modelling approach for the mine and the number of years between 
abandonment and the inventory year to calculate emissions or an appropriate emission factor for each mine. 
• 
Sum abandoned mine emissions to develop an annual inventory. 
4.1.5.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Estimating emissions from abandoned mines requires historical data, rather than current activity data. For Tier 1, 
country experts should estimate the number of mines abandoned by time interval in Table 4.1.5, on the basis of 
historical data available from appropriate national international agencies or regional experts. 
For Tier 2, the total number of abandoned mines and the time period of their abandonment are required. These 
data may be obtained from appropriate national, state, or provincial agencies, or companies active in the coal 
industry. If a country consists of more than one coal region or basin, production and emissions data may be 
disaggregated by region. Expert judgment and statistical analysis may be used to estimate ventilation emissions 
or specific emissions based on measurements from a limited number of mines (see Franklin et al (2004)). 
For Tier 3, abandoned coal mine emissions estimates should be based on detailed data about the characteristics, 
data of abandonment and geographical location of individual mines. In the absence of direct measurements of the 
abandoned mine, Tier 3 emissions factors may be based on mine-specific emissions data, including historical 
emissions data from degasification and ventilation systems when the mine(s) were active (see Franklin et al, 
2004).  
EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FROM METHANE RECOVERY AT ABANDONED MINES  
Abandoned mines where recovery and utilisation or flaring of abandoned mine methane is taking place should be 
accounted for by comparing the amount of methane recovered and utilized with the amount expected to have 
been emitted naturally. The method for accounting for methane recovered from abandoned coal mines is 
described in Section 4.1.5.1. 
The CO2 emissions produced from combustion of methane from abandoned mine recovery and utilization 
projects should be included in the energy sector estimates where there is utilisation, or under fugitive abandoned 
mine emissions where there is flaring. To make this estimate, abandoned mine methane project recovery or 
production data may be publicly available through appropriate government agencies depending on the end use. 
This information may be in the form of metered gas sales and is often publicly available in oil and gas industry 
or governmental databases. An additional 3 to 8 percent of undocumented abandoned mine methane is typically 
recovered and used as fuel for compression of the gas. The actual percentage of methane used will depend on the 
efficiency of the compression equipment. The emissions from this energy use should be reported under Volume 
2, Chapter 2 ‘Stationary Combustion’. For projects that use recovered methane from abandoned mines for 
electricity generation, metered flow rates and compression factors, if available, can be used. If public data 
accurately reflect electricity produced, then the heat rate or efficiency of the electricity generator can be used to 
determine its fuel consumption rate. 
4.1.5.4 
COMPLETENESS 
The emissions estimates from abandoned underground mines should include all emissions leaking from the 
abandoned mines. Until recently, there were no methods by which these emissions could be estimated. Good 
practice is to record the date of mine closure and the method of sealing. Data on the size and depth of such mines 
would be useful for any subsequent estimation. 
4.1.5.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
It is unlikely that comprehensive mine-by-mine (Tier 3) data will be available for all years. Therefore, in order to 
prepare hybrid Tier 2 – Tier 3 inventories, as well as Tier 1 or Tier 2 inventories, the number of abandoned 
mines may need to be estimated for years for which there are sparse data. 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.29 
These inventory guidelines recommend that methane emissions associated with abandoned mines should be 
accounted for in the inventory year in which the emissions and recovery operations occur. 
For situations where the emissions of greenhouse gases from active underground mines have been well 
characterized and the mines have passed from being considered ‘active’ to ‘abandoned’, data from the active 
mine emissions (during the year in which the mine was closed) should be collected. Great care should be taken 
in  transferring mines from the active to the abandoned inventory so that no double-counting or omissions occur. 
4.1.5.6 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT  
TIER 1 
The primary causes of the uncertainty related to the Tier 1 methodology include the following: 
• 
The global nature of the emission factors. The range of uncertainty of these emission factors is intentionally 
large to account for the uncertainty in the determining parameters such as mine size, mine depth, and coal 
rank. 
• 
Time of abandonment. Because emissions from abandoned mines are strongly time dependent, selecting a 
single interval that best represents the dates of closure for all mines is critical in establishing an emissions 
rate. 
• 
The activity data. Both the number of gassy abandoned mines and the amount of coal that has been 
produced from gassy mines are strongly country-dependent. The uncertainty will be defined by the 
availability of historic mining and production records.  
The total estimated range of uncertainty associated with Tier 1 estimations will depend on each of the factors 
discussed above. Actual emissions are likely to be in the range of one-third to three times the estimated 
emissions value. 
TIER 2 
The primary causes of uncertainty related to the Tier 2 approaches include the following: 
• 
The country- or basin-specific emission factors. Uncertainty is associated with the emission factor decline 
equations for each coal rank. This uncertainty is a function of the inherent variability of gas content, 
adsorption characteristics, and permeability within a given coal rank. 
• 
The number of mines producing a given coal rank. 
• 
The number of mines abandoned through time. 
• 
The percentage of gassy mines as a function of time. 
The total estimated uncertainty associated with Tier 2 estimations depends on the range of uncertainty associated 
with each of these factors. These parameters should be more narrowly defined than for Tier 1. Thus, total actual 
emissions are likely to be in the range of one-half to twice the estimated value.  
TIER 3 
The primary uncertainties associated with emissions inventories generated using the Tier 3 methodology include 
the following: 
• 
Active mine emission rate 
• 
Decline curve equation or modelling approach that describes the function relating adsorption characteristics 
and gas content of the coal, mine size, and coal permeability 
• 
Hydrological status of the abandoned mine (flooded or flooding) and condition (sealed or vented). 
 The Tier 3 methodology has lower associated uncertainty than Tiers 1 and 2 because the emissions inventory is 
based either on direct measurements or on mine-specific information including active emission rates and mine 
closure dates. Although the range of uncertainty associated with estimated emissions from an individual mine 
may be large (in the ±50 percent range), summing the uncertainty range of a sufficient number of individual 
mine emissions actually reduces the range of uncertainty of the final inventory, per the central limits theorem 
(Murtha, 2002), provided the uncertainties are independent. Given the expected range of the number of 
abandoned coal mines across different countries, the overall uncertainty associated with Tier 3 methodology for 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.30 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
abandoned mines may vary from ±20 percent for countries with a large number of abandoned mines to ±30 
percent for a country with a fewer number of abandoned mines whose emissions are included in the inventory. 
A combination of different Tiers may be used. For example, the emissions from mines abandoned during the first 
half of the twentieth century may be determined using a Tier 1 method, while emissions from mines abandoned 
after 1950 may be determined using a Tier 2 method. The Tier 1 and Tier 2 methods will each have their own 
uncertainty distribution. It is important to properly sum these distributions in order to arrive at the appropriate 
range of uncertainty for the final emissions inventory. 
4.1.6 
Completeness for coal mining 
There are three remaining gaps in developing a complete inventory for fugitive emissions from coal mining. 
These are abandoned surface mines, uncontrolled combustion and CO2 in coal seam gas.  
ABANDONED SURFACE MINES 
After closure, emissions from abandoned surface mines may include the following:  
• 
The standing highwall 
• 
Leakage from the pit floor 
• 
Low temperature oxidation 
• 
Uncontrolled combustion  
At present, no comprehensive methods to quantify these emissions have been developed and therefore they have 
not been included in these guidelines. They remain subjects for further research. 
EMISSIONS FROM UNCONTROLLED COMBUSTION AND BURNING COAL 
DEPOSITS  
While emissions from this source may be significant for an individual coal mine, it is unclear as to how 
significant these emissions may be for an individual country. In some countries where such fires are widespread, 
the emissions may be very significant. There are no clear methods available at present to systematically measure 
or precisely estimate the activity data, though where countries have data on amounts of coal burned, the CO2 
should be estimated on the basis of the carbon content of the coal and reported in the relevant subcategory of 
1.B.1.b. It is noted that uncontrolled combustion only due to coal exploration activities is considered here. Care 
should be taken to avoid double counting with fugitive CH4 and low oxidation CO2 emissions. 
CO 2 IN COAL MINE GAS 
Countries with data available on CO2 in their coal mine gas should include it with the sub-category used for the 
corresponding methane emissions.

emissions.

INVENTORY COMPILER REVIEW (QA)  
The inventory compiler should ensure that suitable methodologies are used to calculate emissions from coal 
mining, including use of the highest applicable Tier for a given country, taking into account what are considered 
key category for that country as well as the availability of data. The inventory compiler should ensure that 
appropriate emission factors are used. For active underground and surface mines, the best available activity data 
should be used in accordance with the appropriate Tiers, especially the amount of methane recovered and 
utilized wherever possible. For abandoned mines, the compiler should ensure the most accurate available 
historical information is used.  
INVENTORY COMPILER QC ON COMPILING NATIONAL EMISSIONS 
Methods the inventory compiler can employ to provide quality control for the national inventory may include, 
for example: 
• 
Back-calculating national and regional emission factors from Tier 3 measurement data, where applicable 
• 
Ensuring that emission factors are representative of the country (for Tier 1 and Tier 2) 
• 
Ensuring that all mines are included 
• 
Comparing with national trends to look for anomalies 
EXTERNAL INVENTORY QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA/QC) SYSTEMS 
The inventory compiler should arrange for an independent, objective review of calculations, assumptions, and/or 
documentation of the emissions inventory to be performed to assess the effectiveness of the QC programme. The 
peer review should be performed by expert(s) who are familiar with the source category and who understand 
inventory requirements. 
4.1.7.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, chapter 8 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
 The national inventory report should include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that 
the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. However, to 
ensure transparency, the following information should be supplied: 
• 
Emissions by underground, surface, and post-mining components of CH4 and CO2 (where appropriate), the 
method used for each of the sub-source categories, the number of active mines in each sub-source category 
and the reasons for the chosen emission factors (e.g. depth of mining, data on in situ gas contents etc.). The 
amount of drained gas and the degree of any mitigation or utilisation should be presented with a description 
of the technology used, where appropriate. 
• 
Activity data: Specify the amount and type of production, underground and surface coal, listing raw and 
saleable amounts where available. 
• 
Where issues of confidentiality arise, the name of the mine need not be disclosed. Most countries will have 
more than three mines, so mine-specific production cannot be back calculated from the emission estimates. 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.32 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 
It is important to ensure that in the transition of mines from ‘active’ to ‘abandoned’ each mine is included once 
and only once in the national inventory. 
4.2 
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM OIL AND 
NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS 
Fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems are accounted for in IPCC subcategory 1.B.2 of the energy 
sector. For reporting purposes, this subcategory is subdivided as shown in Table 4.2.1. The main distinction is 
made between oil and natural gas systems, with each being subdivided according to the primary type of 
emissions source, namely: venting, flaring and all other types of fugitive emissions. The latter category is further 
subdivided into the different parts (or segments) of the oil or gas system according to the type of activity.  
 
The term fugitive emissions is broadly applied here to mean all greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas 
systems except contributions from fuel combustion. Oil and natural gas systems comprise all infrastructure 
required to produce, collect, process or refine and deliver natural gas and petroleum products to market. The 
system begins at the well head, or oil and gas source, and ends at the final sales point to the consumer. Emissions 
excluded from this category are as follows: 
 
• 
 Fuel combustion for the production of useful heat or energy by stationary or mobile sources (see Chapters 2 
and 3 of the Energy Volume). 
• 
Fugitive emissions from carbon capture and storage projects, the transport and disposal of acid gas from oil 
and gas facilities by injection into secure underground formations, or the transport, injection and 
sequestering of CO2 as part of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), enhanced gas recovery (EGR) or enhanced 
coal bed methane (ECBM) projects (see Chapter 5 of the Energy Volume on carbon dioxide capture and 
storage systems). 
• 
Fugitive emissions that occur at industrial facilities other than oil and gas facilities, or that are associated 
with the end use of oil and gas products at anything other than oil and gas facilities (see the Industrial 
Processes and Product Use Volume). 
• 
Fugitive emissions from waste disposal activities that occur outside the oil and gas industry (see the Waste 
Volume). 
Fugitive emissions from the oil and gas production portions of EOR, EGR and ECBM projects are part of 
Category 1.B.2. 
 
When determining fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems it may, primarily in the areas of 
production and processing, be necessary to apply greater disaggregation than is shown in Table 4.2.1 to account 
better for local factors affecting the amount of emissions (i.e., reservoir conditions, processing/treatment 
requirements, design and operating practices, age of the industry, market access, regulatory requirements and the 
level of regulatory enforcement), and to account for changes in activity levels in progressing through the 
different parts of the system. The percentage contribution by each category in Table 4.2.1 to total fugitive 
emissions by the oil and gas sector will vary according to a country’s circumstances and the amount of oil and 
gas imported and exported. Typically, production and processing activities tend to have greater amounts of 
fugitive emissions as a percentage of throughput than downstream activities. Some examples of the potential 
distribution of fugitive emissions by subcategory are provided in the API (2004) Compendium. 
4.2.1 
Overview, description of sources 
The sources of fugitive emissions on oil and gas systems include, but are not limited to, equipment leaks, 
evaporation and flashing losses, venting, flaring, incineration and accidental releases (e.g., pipeline dig-ins, well 
blow-outs and spills). While some of these emission sources are engineered or intentional (e.g., tank, seal and 
process vents and flare systems), and therefore relatively well characterised, the quantity and composition of the 
emissions is generally subject to significant uncertainty. This is due, in part, to the limited use of measurement 
systems in these cases, and where measurement systems are used, the typical inability of these to cover the wide 
range of flows and variations in composition that may occur. Even where some of these losses or flows are 
tracked as part of routine production accounting procedures, there are often inconsistencies in the activities 
which get accounted for and whether the amounts are based on engineering estimates or measurements. 
Throughout this chapter, an effort is made to state the precise type of fugitive emission source being discussed, 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.33 
and to only use the term fugitive emissions or fugitive emission sources when discussing these emissions or 
sources at a higher, more aggregated, level. 
 
Streams containing pure or high concentrations of CO2 may occur at oil production facilities where CO2 is being 
injected into an oil reservoir for EOR, ECBM or EGR. They may also occur at gas processing, oil refining and 
heavy oil upgrading facilities as a by-product of gas treating to meet sales or fuel gas specifications, and at 
refineries and heavy oil upgraders as a by-product of hydrogen production. Where CO2 occurs as a process by-
product it is usually vented to the atmosphere, injected into a suitable underground formation for disposal or 
supplied for use in EOR projects. Fugitive CO2 emissions from these streams should be accounted for under the 
appropriate subcategories of 1.B.2. Fugitive CO2 emissions from CO2 capture should be accounted for in the 
industry where capture occurs, while the fugitive CO2 emissions from transport, injection and storage activities 
should be accounted for separately in category 1.C (refer to Chapter 5). 
  
EOR is the recovery of oil from a reservoir by means other than using the natural reservoir pressure. It can begin 
after a secondary recovery process or at any time during the productive life of an oil reservoir. EOR generally 
results in increased amounts of oil being removed from a reservoir in comparison to methods using natural 
pressure or pumping alone. The three major types of enhanced oil recovery operations are chemical flooding 
(alkaline flooding or micellar-polymer flooding), miscible displacement (CO2 injection or hydrocarbon injection), 
and thermal recovery (steamflood or in-situ combustion).

Production and 
Upgrading 
Fugitive emissions from oil production (excluding venting 
and flaring) occur at the oil wellhead or at the oil sands or 
shale oil mine through to the start of the oil transmission 
system. This includes fugitive emissions related to well 
servicing, oil sands or shale oil mining, transport of untreated 
production (i.e , well effluent, emulsion, oil shale and 
oilsands) to treating or extraction facilities, activities at 
extraction and upgrading facilities, associated gas re-injection 
systems and produced water disposal systems. Fugitive 
emissions from upgraders are grouped with those from 
production rather than those from refining since the upgraders 
are often integrated with extraction facilities and their relative 
emission contributions are difficult to establish. However, 
upgraders may also be integrated with refineries, co-
generation plants or other industrial facilities and their 
relative emission contributions can be difficult to establish in 
these cases  
1 B 2 a iii 3 
Transport 
Fugitive emissions (excluding venting and flaring) related to 
the transport of marketable crude oil (including conventional, 
heavy and synthetic crude oil and bitumen) to upgraders and

Evaporation losses from storage, filling and unloading 
activities and fugitive equipment leaks are the primary 
sources of these emissions

Fugitive emissions (excluding venting and flaring) at 
petroleum refineries. Refineries process crude oils, natural

Energy Production 
Emissions from geo thermal energy production and other

Methodological issues 
Fugitive emissions are a direct source of greenhouse gases due to the release of methane (CH4) and formation 
carbon dioxide (CO2) (i.e., CO2 present in the produced oil and gas when it leaves the reservoir), plus some CO2 
and nitrous oxide (N2O) from non-productive combustion activities (primarily waste gas flaring). As is done for 
fuel combustion (see Chapter 1 of this Volume), CO2 emissions are calculated in Tier 1 assuming that all 
hydrocarbons are fully oxidized. If information is available on partial oxidation, this can be taken into account in 
higher Tiers. 
Venting comprises all engineered or intentional discharges of waste gas streams and process by-products to the 
atmosphere, including emergency discharges. These releases may occur on either a continuous or intermittent 
basis, and may include the following: 
• 
Use of pressurized natural gas instead of compressed air as the supply medium for pneumatic devices (e.g., 
chemical injection pumps, starter motors on compressor engines and instrument control loops). 
• 
Pressure relief and disposal of off-specification product during process upsets. 
• 
Purging and blowdown events related to maintenance and tie-in activities. 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.36 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
• 
Disposal of off-gas streams from oil and gas treatment units (e.g., still-column off-gas from glycol 
dehydrators, emulsion treater overheads and stabilizer overheads). 
• 
Gas releases from drilling, well-testing and pipeline pigging activities. 
• 
Disposal of waste associated gas at oil production facilities and casing-head gas at heavy oil wells where 
there is no gas conservation or re-injection. 
• 
Solution gas emissions from storage tanks, evaporation losses from process sewers, API separators, 
dissolved air flotation units, tailings ponds and storage tanks, and biogenic gas formation from tailings 
ponds. 
• 
Discharge of CO2 extracted from the produced natural gas or produced as a process byproduct. 
Some or all of the vented gas may be captured for storage or utilization. In this instance, the inventory of vented 
emissions should include only the net emissions to the atmosphere. 
Flaring means broadly all burning of waste natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids by flares or incinerators as a 
disposal option rather than for the production of useful heat or energy. The decision on whether to vent or flare 
depends largely on the amount of gas to be disposed of and the specific circumstances (e.g., public, 
environmental and safety issues as well as local regulatory requirements). Normally, waste gas is only vented if 
it is non-odourous and non-toxic, and even then may often be flared. Flaring is most common at production, 
processing, upgrading and refining facilities. Waste gas volumes are usually vented on gas transmission systems 
and may be either vented or flared on gas distribution systems, depending on the circumstances and the 
company’s policies. Sometimes fuel gas may be used to enrich a waste gas stream; so it will support stable 
combustion during flaring. Fuel gas may also be used for other purposes where it may ultimately be vented or 
flared, such as purge or blanket gas and supply gas for gas-operated devices (e.g., for instrument controllers). 
The emissions from these types of fuel uses should be reported under the appropriate venting and flaring 
subcategories rather than under Category 1.A (Fuel Combustion Activities).  
 
Formation CO2 removed from natural gas by the sweetening units at gas processing plants and released to the 
atmosphere is a fugitive emission and should be reported under subcategory 1.B.2.b.i. The CO2 resulting from 
the production of hydrogen at refineries and heavy oil/bitumen upgraders should be reported under subcategory 
1.B.2.a.i. Care should be taken to ensure that the feedstock for the hydrogen plant is not also reported as fuel in 
these cases. 
Fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems are often difficult to quantify accurately. This is largely due 
to the diversity of the industry, the large number and variety of potential emission sources, the wide variations in 
emission-control levels and the limited availability of emission-source data. The main emission assessment 
issues are:  
• 
The use of simple production-based emission factors introduces large uncertainty; 
• 
The application of rigorous bottom-up approaches requires expert knowledge and detailed data that may be 
difficult and costly to obtain; 
• 
Measurement programmes are time consuming and very costly to perform. 
If a rigorous bottom-up approach is chosen, then it is good practice to involve technical representatives from the 
industry in the development of the inventory. 
4.2.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD, DECISION TREES, TIERS 
There are three methodological tiers for determining fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems, as set 
out in Section 4.2.2.2. It is good practice to disaggregate the activities into Major Categories and Subcategories 
in the Oil and Gas Industry (see Table 4.2.2 in Section 4.2.2.2), and then evaluate the emissions separately for 
each of these. The methodological tier applied to each segment should be commensurate with the amount of 
emissions and the available resources. Consequently, it may be appropriate to apply different methodological 
tiers to different categories and subcategories, and possibly even include actual emission measurement or 
monitoring results for some larger sources. The overall approach, over time, should be one of progressive 
refinement to address the areas of greatest uncertainty and consequence, and to capture the impact of control 
measures. 
Figure 4.2.1 provides a general decision tree for selecting an appropriate approach for a given segment of the 
natural gas industry. The decision tree is intended to be applied successively to each subcategory within the 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.37 
natural gas system (e.g., gas production, then gas processing, then gas transmission, then gas distribution). The 
basic decision process is as follows: 
• 
check if the detailed data needed to apply a Tier 3 approach are readily available, and if so, then apply a Tier 
3 approach (i.e., regardless of whether the category is key and the subcategory is significant), otherwise, if   
these data are not readily available: 
• 
check if the detailed data needed to apply a Tier 2 approach are readily available, and if so, then apply a Tier 
2 approach, otherwise, if these data are not readily available: 
• 
check to see if the category is key and the specific subcategory being considered is significant based on the 
IPCC definitions of key and significant, and if so, go back and gather the data needed to apply a Tier 3 or 
Tier 2 approach, otherwise, if the subcategory is not significant: 
• 
apply a Tier 1 approach. 
 
The ability to use a Tier 3 approach will depend on the availability of detailed production statistics and 
infrastructure data (e.g., information regarding the numbers and types of facilities and the amount and type of 
equipment used at each site), and it may not be possible to apply it under all circumstances. A Tier 1 approach is 
the simplest method to apply but is susceptible to substantial uncertainties and may easily be in error by an 
order-of-magnitude or more. For this reason, it should only be used as a last resort option. Where a Tier 3 
approach is used in one year and the results are used to develop Tier 2 emission factors for use in other years, the 
applied methodology should be reported as Tier 2 in those other years. 
Similarly, Figures 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 apply to crude oil production and transport systems, and to oil upgraders and 
refineries, respectively. 
Where a country has estimated fugitive emissions from oil and gas systems based on a compilation of estimates 
reported by individual oil and gas companies, this may either be a Tier 2 or Tier 3 approach, depending on the 
actual approaches applied by individual companies and facilities. In both cases, care needs to be taken to ensure 
there is no omitting or double counting of emissions.

TIER 1 
Tier 1 comprises the application of appropriate default emission factors to a representative activity parameter 
(usually throughput) for each applicable segment or subcategory of a country’s oil and natural gas industry and 
should only be used for non-key sources. The application of a Tier1 approach is done using Equations 4.2.1 and 
4.2.2 presented below:

Where:  
Egas,industry segement

EFgas,industry segement = emission factor (Gg/unit of activity), 
A industry segement 
= activity value (units of activity), 
The industry segments to be considered are listed in Table 4.2.2. Not all segments will necessarily apply to all 
countries. For example, a country that only imports natural gas and does not produce any will probably only 
have gas transmission and distribution. The available Tier 1 default emission factors are presented in Tables 
4.2.4 and 4.2.5 in Section 4.2.2.3. These factors have been related to throughput, because production, imports 
and exports are the only national oil and gas statistics that are consistently available. On a small scale, fugitive 
emissions are completely independent of throughput. The best relation for estimating emissions from fugitive 
equipment leaks is based on the number and type of equipment components and the type of service, which is a 
Tier-3 approach. On a larger scale, there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of production and the 
amount of infrastructure that exists. Consequently, the reliability of the presented Tier 1 factors for oil and gas 
systems will depend on the size of a country's oil and gas industry. The larger the industry, the more important 
its fugitive emissions contribution will be and the more reliable the presented Tier 1 emission factors will be. 
Besides having a high degree of uncertainty, the Tier 1 approach for oil and natural gas systems does not allow 
countries to show any real changes in emission intensities over time (e.g., due to the implementation of control 
measures or changing source characteristics). Rather, emissions become fixed in proportion to the activity levels, 
and the changes in reported emissions over time simply reflect the changes in activity levels. Tier 2 and 3 
approaches are needed to capture real changes in emission intensities. However, going to these higher tier 
approaches requires considerably more effort and, for Tier 3 approaches, more detailed activity data. The 
completeness and accuracy of the input information used for higher tier approaches will generally need to be 
comparable to, or better than, the values of the input information used for the lower methodological tiers in order 
to achieve more accurate results. 
Fugitive greenhouse gas  emissions from oil and gas related CO2 capture and injection activities (e.g., acid gas 
injection and EOR projects involving CO2 floods) will normally be small compared to the amount of CO2 being 
injected (e.g., less than 1 percent of the injection volumes). At the Tier 1 or 2 methodology levels they are 
indistinguishable from fugitive greenhouse gas emissions by the associated oil and gas activities. The emission 
contributions from CO2 capture and injection were included in the original data upon which the presented Tier 1 
factors were developed (i.e., through the inclusion of acid gas injection and EOR activities, along with 
conventional oil and gas activities, with consideration of CO2 concentrations in the leaked, vented and flared 
natural gases, vapours and acid gases). Losses from CO2 capture should be accounted for in the industry where 
capture occurs, while losses from, transport, injection and storage activities are assessed separately in Chapter 5.

a Dry gas is natural gas that does not require any hydrocarbon dew-point control to meet sales gas specifications. 
 However, it may still require treating to meet sales specifications for water and acid gas (i.e. H2S and CO2) content. Dry 
 gas is usually produced from shallow (less than 1000 m deep) gas wells.  
b Sweet gas is natural gas that does not contain any appreciable amount of H2S (i.e. does not require any treatment to 
 meet sales gas requirements for H2S). 
c Sour gas is natural gas that must be treated to satisfy sales gas restrictions on H2S content. 
d Deep-cut extraction plants are gas processing plants located on gas transmission systems which are used to recover 
 residual ethane and heavier hydrocarbons present in the natural gas. 
 
TIER 2 
Tier 2 consists of using Tier 1 equations (4.2.1 and 4.2.2) with country-specific, instead of default, emission 
factors. It should be applied to key categories where the use of a Tier 3 approach is not practicable. The country-
specific values may be developed from studies and measurement programmes, or be derived by initially applying 
a Tier 3 approach and then back-calculating Tier 2 emission factors using Equations 4.2.1 and 4.2.2. For 
example, some countries have been applying Tier 3 approaches for particular years and have then used these 
results to develop Tier 2 factors for use in subsequent years until the next Tier 3 assessment is performed. In 
general, all emission factors (including Tier 1 and Tier 2 values) should be periodically re-affirmed or updated. 
The frequency at which such updates are performed should be commensurate with the rates at which new 
technologies, practices, standards and other relevant factors (e.g., changes in the types of oil and gas activities, 
aging of the fields and facilities, etc.) are penetrating the industry. Since new emission factors developed in this 
manner account for real changes within the industry, they should not be applied backwards through the time 
series.  
An alternative Tier 2 approach that may be applied to estimate the amount of venting and flaring emissions from 
the production segment of oil systems consists of performing a mass balance using country-specific production 
volumes, gas-to-oil ratios (GORs), gas compositions and information regarding the level of gas conservation. 
This approach may be applied using equations 4.2.3 to 4.2.8 below and is appropriate where reliable venting and 
flaring values are unavailable but representative GOR data can be obtained and venting and flaring emissions are 
expected to be the dominant sources of fugitive emissions (i.e., most of the associated gas production is not 
being captured/conserved or utilized). Under these circumstances, the alternative Tier 2 approach may also be 
used to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from EOR activities provided representative associated gas 
and vapour analyses are available and contributions due to fugitive emissions from the CO2 transport and 
injection systems are small in comparison (as would normally be expected). Where the alternative Tier 2 
approach is applied, any reported venting or flaring data that may be available for the target sources should not 
also be accounted for as this would result in double counting. However, it is good practice to compare the 
estimated gas vented and flared volumes determined using the GOR data to the available reported vented and 
flared data to identify and resolve any potential anomalies (i.e., the calculated volumes should be comparable to 
the available reported data, or greater if these latter data are believed to be incomplete). 
Table 4.2.3 shows examples of typical GOR values for oil wells from selected locations. Actual GOR values 
may vary from 0 to very high values depending on the local geology, state of the producing reservoir and the rate 
of production. Notwithstanding this, average GOR values for large numbers of oil wells tend to be more 
predictable. A review of limited data for a number of countries and regions indicates that average GOR values 
for conventional oil production would usually be in the range of about 100 to 350 m3/m3, depending on the 
location.

 significant gas cap present and the gas would normally be reinjected until all the recoverable oil had been produced.

5 Values as high as 7,160 m3/m3 have been observed for some wells where there is a significant gas cap present. Gas 
 reinjection is not done in these applications. The gas is conserved, vented or flared. 
6 Referenced at standard conditions of 15°C and 101.325 kPa. 
 
To apply a mass balance method in the alternative Tier 2 approach, it is necessary to consider the fate of all of 
the produced gas and vapour. This is done, in part, through the application of a conservation efficiency (CE) 
factor which expresses the amount of the produced gas and vapour that is captured and used for fuel, produced 
into gas gathering systems or re-injected. A CE value of 1.0 means all gas is conserved, utilized or re-injected 
and a value of 0 means all of the gas is either vented or flared. Values may be expected to range from about 0.1 
to 0.95. The lower limit applies where only process fuel is drawn from the produced gas and the rest is vented or 
flared. A value of 0.95 reflects circumstances where there is, generally, good access to gas gathering systems and 
local regulations emphasize vent and flare gas reduction.

The values of ECH4, oil prod, venting and ECO2, oil prod, venting in Equations 4.2.6 and 4.2.7 are estimated using Equation 
4.2.3. 
It should be noted that Equation 4.2.5 accounts for emissions of CO2 using a similar approach to what is done for 
fuel combustion in Section 1.3 of the Introduction chapter of the Energy Volume. The term yCO2 in this 
equation effectively accounts for the amount of raw (or formation CO2) present in the waste gas being flared. 
The terms NcCH4 ● yCH4 and NcNMVOC ● yNMVOC in Equation 4.2.5 account for the amount of CO2 
produced per unit of CH4 and NMVOC oxidized.  
TIER 3 
Tier 3 comprises the application of a rigorous bottom-up assessment by primary type of source (e.g., venting, 
flaring, fugitive equipment leaks, evaporation losses and accidental releases) at the individual facility level with 
appropriate accounting of contributions from temporary and minor field or well-site installations. It should be 
used for key categories where the necessary activity and infrastructure data are readily available or are 
reasonable to obtain. Tier 3 should also be used to estimate emissions from surface facilities where EOR, EGR 
and ECBM are being used in association with CCS. Approaches that estimate emissions at a less disaggregated 
level than this (e.g., relate emissions to the number of facilities or the amount of throughput) are deemed to be 
equivalent to a Tier 1 approach if the applied factors are taken from the general literature, or a Tier 2 approach if 
they are country-specific values.  
The key types of data that would be utilized in a Tier 3 assessment would include the following: 
• 
 Facility inventory, including an assessment of the type and amount of equipment or process units at each 
facility, and major emission controls (e.g., vapour recovery, waste gas incineration, etc.). 
• 
Inventory of wells and minor field installations (e.g., field dehydrators, line heaters, well site metering, etc.). 
• 
Country-specific flare, vent and process gas analyses for each subcategory. 
• 
Facility-level acid gas production, analyses and disposition data. 
• 
Reported atmospheric releases due to well blow-outs and pipeline ruptures. 
• 
Country-specific emission factors for fugitive equipment leaks, unaccounted/unreported venting and flaring, 
flashing losses at production facilities, evaporation losses, etc. 
• 
The amount and composition of acid gas that is injected into secure underground formations for disposal. 
Oil and gas projects that involve CO2 injection as a means of enhancing production (e.g., EOR, EGR and ECBM 
projects) or as a disposal option (e.g., acid gas injection at sour gas processing plants) should distinguish 
between the CO2 capture, transport, injection and sequestering part of the project, and the oil and gas production 
portion of the project. The net amount of CO2 sequestered and the fugitive emissions from the CO2 systems 
should be determined based on the criteria specified in Chapter 5 for CO2 capture and storage. Any fugitive 
emissions from the oil and gas systems in these projects should be assessed based on the guidance provided here 
in Chapter 4 and will exhibit increasing concentrations of CO2 over time in the emitted natural gas and 
hydrocarbon vapours. Accordingly, the applied emission factors may need to be periodically updated to account 
for this fact. Also, care should be taken to ensure that proper total accounting of all CO2 between the two 
portions of the project occurs. 
4.2.2.3 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTOR 
 
TIER 1 
The available Tier 1 default emission factors are presented in Tables 4.2.4 and 4.2.5. All of the presented 
emission factors are expressed in units of mass emissions per unit volume of oil or gas throughput. While some 
types of fugitive emissions correlate poorly with, or are unrelated to, throughput on an individual source basis 
(e.g., fugitive equipment leaks), the correlations with throughput become more reasonable when large 
populations of sources are considered. Furthermore, throughput statistics are the most consistently available 
activity data for use in Tier 1 calculations. 
 
Table 4.2.4 should only be applied to systems designed, operated and maintained to North American and 
Western European standards. Table 4.2.5 generally applies to systems in developing countries and countries with 
economies in transition where there are much greater amounts of fugitive emissions per unit of activity (often by 
an order of magnitude or more). The reasons for the greater emissions in these cases may include less stringent 
design standards, use of lower quality components, restricted access to natural gas markets, and, in some cases,

artificially low energy pricing resulting in reduced energy conservation. Reference should also be made to the 
IPCC emission factor database (EFDB) since it would contain the values for higher tier emission factors.

TABLE 4.2.4(CONTINUED) 
TIER 1 EMISSION FACTORS FOR FUGITIVE EMISSIONS (INCLUDING VENTING AND FLARING) FROM OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS 
IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIESa,b 
NA - Not Applicable  ND - Not Determined 
a While the presented emission factors may all vary appreciably between countries, the greatest differences are expected to occur with respect to venting and flaring, particularly for oil production due to the potential for 
 significant differences in the amount of gas conservation and utilisation practised. 
b The range in values for fugitive emissions is attributed primarily to differences in the amount of process infrastructure (e.g. average number and sizes of facilities) per unit of gas throughput. 
c ‘All’ denotes all fugitive emissions as well as venting and flaring emissions. 
d ‘Fugitives’ denotes all fugitive emissions including those from fugitive equipment leaks, storage losses, use of natural gas as the supply medium for gas-operated devices (e.g. instrument control loops, chemical injection 
 pumps, compressor starters, etc.), and venting of still-column off-gas from glycol dehydrators. The presented range in values reflects the difference between fugitive emissions at offshore (the smaller value) and onshore 
 (the larger value) emissions. 
e ‘Flaring’ denotes emissions from all continuous and emergency flare systems. The specific flaring rates may vary significantly between countries. Where actual flared volumes are known, these should be used to 
 determine flaring emissions rather than applying the presented emission factors to production rates. The emission factors for direct estimation of CH4, CO2 and N2O emissions from reported flared volumes are 0.012, 2.0 
 and 0.000023 Gg, respectively, per 106 m3 of gas flared based on a flaring efficiency of 98% and a typical gas analysis at a gas processing plant (i.e. 91.9% CH4, 0.58% CO2, 0.68% N2 and 6.84% non-methane 
 hydrocarbons by volume).  
f The larger factor reflects the use of mostly reciprocating compressors on the system while the smaller factor reflects mostly centrifugal compressors. 
g ‘Venting’ denotes reported venting of waste associated and solution gas at oil production facilities and waste gas volumes from blowdown, purging and emergency relief events at gas facilities. Where actual vented 
 volumes are known, these should be used to determine venting emissions rather than applying the presented emission factors to production rates. The emission factors for direct estimation of CH4 and CO2 emissions 
 from reported vented volumes are 0.66 and 0.0049 Gg, respectively, per 106 m3 of gas vented based on a typical gas analysis for gas transmission and distribution systems (i.e. 97.3% CH4, 0.26% CO2, 1.7% N2 and 
 0.74% non-methane hydrocarbons by volume).  
h While no factors are available for marine loading of offshore production for North America, Norwegian data indicate a CH4 emission factor of 1.0 to 3.6 Gg/103 m3 of oil transferred (derived from data provided by 
 Norwegian Pollution Control Authority, 2000).  
I Estimated based on an aggregated emission factors for fugitive equipment leaks, fluid catalytic cracking and storage and handling of 0.53 kg/m3 (CPPI and Environment Canada, 1991), 0.6 kg/m3 ( US EPA, 1995) and 
 0.2 g/kg (assuming the majority of the volatile products are stored in floating roof tanks with secondary seals) (EMEP/CORINAIR, 1996).  
j Estimated based on assumed average evaporation losses of 0.15 percent of throughput at the distribution terminal and additional losses of 0.15 percent of throughput at the retail outlet. These values will be much lower 
 where Stage 1 and Stage 2 vapour recovery occurs and may be much greater in warm climates. 
k NMVOC values are derived from methane values based on the ratio of the mass fractions of NMVOC to CH4. Values of 0.0144 kg/kg for gas transmission and distribution, 9.951 kg/kg for oil and condensate 
 transportation and 0.3911 kg/kg for synthetic crude oil production are used. 
l The presented CO2 emissions factors account for direct CO2 emissions only, except for flaring, in which case the presented values account for the sum of direct CO2 emissions and indirect contributions due to the 
 atmospheric oxidation of gaseous non-CO2 carbon emissions.

TIER 1 EMISSION FACTORS FOR FUGITIVE EMISSIONS (INCLUDING VENTING AND FLARING) FROM OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS 
IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND COUNTRIES WITH ECONOMIES IN TRANSITIONa,b 
 
NA - Not Applicable  ND – Not Determined  
a While the presented emission factors may all vary appreciably between countries, the greatest differences are expected to occur with respect to venting and flaring, particularly for oil production due to the potential for 
 significant differences in the amount of gas conservation and utilisation practised. 
b The range in values for fugitive emissions is attributed primarily to differences in the amount of process infrastructure (e.g. average number and sizes of facilities) per unit of gas throughput. 
c ‘All’ denotes all fugitive emissions as well as venting and flaring emissions. 
d ‘fugitives’ denotes all fugitive emissions including those from fugitive equipment leaks, storage losses, use of natural gas as the supply medium for gas-operated devices (e.g. instrument control loops, chemical injection 
 pumps, compressor starters, etc.), and venting of still-column off-gas from glycol dehydrators. 
e ‘Flaring’ denotes emissions from all continuous and emergency flare systems. The specific flaring rates may vary significantly between countries. Where actual flared volumes are known, these should be used to 
 determine  
flaring emissions rather than applying the presented emission factors to production rates. The emission factors for direct estimation of CH4, CO2 and N2O emissions from reported flared volumes are 
 0.012, 2.0 and 0.000023  
Gg, respectively, per 106 m3 of gas flared based on a flaring efficiency of 98% and a typical gas analysis at a gas processing plant (i.e. 91.9% CH4, 0.58% CO2, 0.68% N2 and 6.84% non-
 methane hydrocarbons by volume).  
f The larger factor reflects the use of mostly reciprocating compressors on the system while the smaller factor reflects mostly centrifugal compressors. 
g ‘Venting’ denotes reported venting of waste associated and solution gas at oil production facilities and waste gas volumes from blowdown, purging and emergency relief events at gas facilities. Where actual vented 
 volumes  are known, these should be used to determine venting emissions rather than applying the presented emission factors to production rates. The emission factors for direct estimation of CH4 and CO2 emissions 
 from reported  
vented volumes are 0.66 and 0.0049 Gg, respectively, per 106 m3 of gas vented based on a typical gas analysis for gas transmission and distribution systems (i.e. 97.3% CH4, 0.26% CO2, 1.7% N2 
 and 0.74% non-methane  
hydrocarbons by volume).  
h While no factors are available for marine loading of offshore production for North America, Norwegian data indicate a CH4 emission factor of 1.0 to 3.6 Gg/103 m3 of oil transferred (derived from data provided by 
 Norwegian Pollution Control Authority, 2000).  
I  The presented CO2 emissions factors account for direct CO2 emissions only, except for flaring, in which case the presented values account for the sum of direct CO2 emissions and indirect contributions due to the 
 atmospheric oxidation of gaseous non-CO2 carbon emissions. 
 Sources: The factors presented in this table have been determined by setting the lower limit of the range for each category equal to at least the values published in Table 4.2.4 for North America. Otherwise, all presented 
 values have been adapted from applicable data provided in the 1996 IPCC Guidelines and from limited measurement data available from more recent unpublished studies of natural gas systems in China, Romania and 
 Uzbekistan. 
 
 
Volume 2 : Energy 
4.64 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
The factors in Table 4.2.4 for North America are derived from detailed emission inventory results for Canada 
and the United States and, where possible, have been updated from the values previously presented in the IPCC 
Good Practice Guidance (2000) document to reflect the results of more current and refined emissions inventories. 
Where applicable, factors from the API Compendium of Emissions Estimating Methodologies for the Petroleum 
Industry have been indicated.  
The factors in Table 4.2.4 are presented as examples and reflect the following practices and state of the oil and 
gas industry: 
• 
Most associated gas is conserved; 
• 
Sweet waste gas is flared or vented; 
• 
Sour waste gas is flared; 
• 
Many gas transmission companies are voluntarily implementing programmes to reduce methane losses due 
to fugitive equipment leaks; 
• 
The oil and gas industry is mature and actually in decline in many areas; 
• 
System reliability is high; 
• 
Equipment is generally well maintained and high-quality components are used; 
• 
Line breaks and well blowouts are rare; 
• 
The industry is highly regulated and these regulations are generally well enforced. 
The emission factors presented in Table 4.2.5 have been set so that the lower limit of each range is at least equal 
to the corresponding value from Table 4.2.4. Otherwise, all values have been adapted from the factors presented 
in the 1996 Revised IPCC Guidelines and from limited measurement data available for several recent 
unpublished studies of natural gas systems in developing countries or countries with economies in transition. 
Where ranges in values are presented, these are either based on the relative ranges given in the 1996 Revised 
IPCC Guidelines or are estimated based on expert judgement and data from unpublished reports.  
A similar approach has also been used to estimate the uncertainty values given for the presented emission factors. 
The large uncertainties given for some of the emission factors reflect the corresponding high variability between 
individual sources, the types and extent of applied controls and, in some cases, the limited amount of data 
available. For many source categories (e.g., equipment leaks), the fugitive emissions have a skewed distribution 
where most of the emissions are emitted by only a small percentage of the population. Where uncertainties are 
less than or equal to ±100 percent, a normal distribution has been assumed, resulting in a symmetric distribution 
about the mean. Wherever the reported uncertainty U percent for a quantity Q is greater than 100 percent, the 
upper limit is Q(100+U)/100 and the lower limit is 100Q/(100+U).  
TIER 3 AND 2 
Emission factors for conducting Tier 3 and Tier 2 assessments are not provided in the IPCC Guidelines due to 
the large amount of such information and the fact these data are continually being updated to include additional 
measurement results and to reflect development and penetration of new control technologies and requirements. 
Rather, the IPCC has developed an Emission Factor Database (EFDB) which will be periodically updated and is 
available through the Internet at www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php. In addition regular reviews of the 
literature should still be conducted to ensure that the best available factors are being used. The references for the 
chosen values should be clearly documented. Typically, emission factors are developed and published by 
environmental agencies and industry associations. It may be necessary to develop inventory estimates in 
consultation with these organisations. For example, the American Petroleum Institute(API) maintains a 
Compendium of Emissions Estimating Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry, most recently updated in 
2004.  The API Compendium is available at: 
http://api-ec.api.org/policy/index.cfm. 
A software tool for estimating greenhouse gas emissions using equations from the API Compendium is available 
at: 
http://ghg.api.org 
Guidance for estimating greenhouse gas emissions has also been developed by a number of national oil and gas 
industry associations. Such documents may be useful supplemental references and often provide tiered source-
specific calculation procedures. Guidance on inventory accounting principles as they apply to the oil and gas 
industry, and boundary definitions is available in the Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions (International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association, 2003):

When selecting emission factors, the chosen values must be valid for the given application and be expressed on 
the same basis as the activity data. It also may be necessary to apply other types of factors to correct for site and 
regional differences in operating conditions and design and maintenance practices, for example: 
• 
Composition profiles of gases from particular oil and gas fields to correct for the amount of CH4, formation 
CO2 and other target emissions; 
• 
Annual operating hours to correct for the amount of time a source is in active service; 
• 
Efficiencies of the specific control measures used. 
The following are additional matters to consider in choosing emission factors: 
• 
It is important to assess the applicability of the selected factors for the target application to ensure similar or 
comparable source behaviour and characteristics; 
• 
In the absence of better data, it may sometimes be necessary to apply factors reported for other regions that 
practice similar levels of emission control and feature comparable types of equipment; 
• 
Where measurements are performed to develop new emission factors, only recognised or defensible test 
procedures should be applied. The method and quality assurance (QA)/quality control (QC) procedures 
should be documented, the sampled sources should be representative of typical variations in the overall 
source population and a statistical analysis should be conducted to establish the 95 percent confidence 
interval on the average results. 
 4.2.2.4 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA  
The activity data required to estimate fugitive emissions from oil and gas activities includes production statistics, 
infrastructure data (e.g., inventories of facilities/installations, process units, pipelines, and equipment 
components), and reported emissions from spills, accidental releases, and third-party damages. The basic activity 
data required for each tier and each type of primary source are summarised in Table 4.2.6, Typical Activity Data 
Requirements for each Assessment Approach by Type of Primary Source Category.  
TIER 1 
The activity data required at the Tier 1 level has been limited to information that may either be obtained directly 
from typical national oil and gas statistics or easily estimated from this information. Table 4.2.7 below lists the 
activity data required by each of the Tier 1 emission factors presented in Tables 4.2.4 and 4.2.5, and gives 
appropriate guidance for obtaining or estimating each of the required activity values. 
TIER 2 
The activity data required for the standard Tier 2 methodological approach is the same as that required for the 
Tier 1 approach. If the alternative Tier 2 approach described in Section 4.2.2.2 for crude oil systems is used, then 
additional, more detailed, information is required including average GOR values, information on the extent of 
gas conservation and factors for apportioning waste associated gas volumes between venting and flaring. This 
additional information should be developed based on input from the industry.

TIER 3 
Specific matters to consider in compiling the detailed activity data required for use in a Tier 3 approach include 
the following: 
• 
Production statistics should be disaggregated to capture changes in throughputs (e.g., due to imports, exports, 
reprocessing, withdrawals, etc.) in progressing through oil and gas systems. 
• 
Production statistics provided by national bureaux should be used in favour of those available from 
international bodies, such as the IEA or the UN, due to their generally better reliability and disaggregation. 
Regional, provincial/state and industry reporting groups may offer even more disaggregation. 
• 
Production data used in estimating fugitive emissions should be corrected, where applicable, to account for 
any net imports or exports. It is possible that import and export data may be available for a country while 
production data are not; however, it is unlikely that the opposite would be true. 
• 
Where coalbed methane is produced into a natural gas gathering system, any associated fugitive emissions 
should be reported under the appropriate natural gas exploration and production categories. This will occur 
by default since the produced gas becomes a commodity once it enters the gas gathering system and 
automatically gets accounted for the same way gas from any other well does when it enters the gathering 
system. The fact that gas is coming from a coal formation would only be discernable at a very disaggregated 
level. Where a coal formation is degassed, regardless of the reason, and the gas is not produced into a 
gathering system, the associated emissions should be allocated to the coal sector under the appropriate 
section of IPCC category 1.B.1. 
• 
Vented and flared volumes from oil and gas statistics may be highly suspect since these values are usually 
estimates and not based on actual measurements. Additionally, the values are often aggregated and simply 
reported as flared volumes. Operating practices of each segment of the industry should be reviewed with 
industry representatives to determine if the reported volumes are actually vented or flared, or to develop 
appropriate apportioning of venting relative to flaring. Audits or reviews of each industry segment should 
also be conducted to determine if all vented and flared volumes are actually reported (for example, solution 
gas emissions from storage tanks and treaters, emergency flaring/venting, leakage into vent/flare systems, 
and blowdown and purging volumes may not necessarily be accounted for). 
• 
Infrastructure data are more difficult to obtain than production statistics. Information concerning the 
numbers and types of major facilities and the types of processes used at these facilities may often be 
available from regulatory agencies and industry groups, or directly from the actual companies.  
• 
Information on minor facilities (e.g., numbers of field dehydrators and field compressors) usually is not 
available, even from oil and gas companies. Consequently, assumptions must be made, based on local 
design practices, to estimate the numbers of these facilities. This may require some fieldwork to develop 
appropriate estimation factors or correlations. 
• 
Many companies use computerised inspection-and-maintenance information management systems. These 
systems can be a very reliable means of counting major equipment units (e.g., compressor units, process 
heaters and boilers, etc.) at selected facilities. Also, some departments within a company may maintain 
databases of certain types of equipment or facilities for various internal reasons (e.g., tax accounting, 
Volume 2 : Energy 
4.70 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
production accounting, insurance records, quality control programmes, safety auditing, license renewals, 
etc.). Efforts should be made to identify these potentially useful sources of information. 
• 
Component counts by type of process unit may vary dramatically between facilities and countries due to 
differences in design and operating practices. Thus, while initially it may be appropriate to use values 
reported in the general literature, countries should strive to develop their own values. 
• 
Use of consistent terminology and clear definitions is critical in developing counts of facilities and 
equipment components, and to allow any meaningful comparisons of the results with others. 
• 
Some production statistics may be reported in units of energy (based on their heating value) and will need to 
be converted to a volume basis, or vice versa, for application of the available emission factors. Typically, 
where production values are expressed in units of energy, it is in terms of the gross (or higher) heating value 
of the product. However, where emission factors are expressed on an energy basis it is normally in terms of 
the net (or lower) heating value of the product. To convert from energy data on a GCV basis to a NCV basis, 
the International Energy Agency assumes a difference of 5 percent for oil and 10 percent for natural gas. 
Individual natural gas streams that are either very rich or high in impurities may differ from these average 
values. Emission factors and activity data must be consistent with each other. 
• 
Oil and gas imports and exports will change the activity levels in corresponding downstream portions of 
these systems. 
• 
Production activities will tend to be the major contributor to fugitive emissions from oil and gas activities in 
countries with low import volumes relative to consumption and export volumes. Gas transmission and 
distribution and petroleum refining will tend to be the major contributors to these emissions in countries 
with high relative import volumes. Overall, net importers will tend to have lower specific emissions than net 
exporters. 
4.2.2.5 
COMPLETENESS  
Completeness is a significant issue in developing an inventory of fugitive emissions for the oil and gas industry. 
It can be addressed through direct comparisons with other countries and, for refined inventories, through 
comparisons between individual companies in the same industry segment and subcategory. This requires the use 
of consistent definitions and classification schemes. For example, in Canada, the upstream petroleum industry 
has adopted a benchmarking scheme that compares the emission inventory results of individual companies in 
terms of production-energy intensity and production-carbon intensity. Such benchmarking allows companies to 
assess their relative environmental performance. It also flags, at a high level, anomalies or possible errors that 
should be investigated and resolved. 
The indicative factors presented in Table 4.2.8 may be used to qualify specific methane losses as being low, 
medium or high and help assess their reasonableness. If specific methane losses are appreciably less than the low 
benchmark or greater than the high benchmark, this should be explained; otherwise, it may be an indication of 
possible missed or double counted contributions, respectively. The ranking of specific methane losses relative to 
the presented indicative factors should not be used as a basis for choosing the most appropriate assessment 
approach; rather, total emissions (i.e. the product of activity data and emission factors), the complexity of the 
industry and available assessment resources should all be considered. 
Where emission inventories are developed based on a compilation of individual company-level inventories, care 
should be taken to ensure that all companies are included. Appropriate extrapolations may be needed to account 
for any non-reporting companies. 
 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.71 
 
Smaller individual sources, when aggregated nationally over the course of a year, may often be significant total 
contributors. Therefore, good practice is not to disregard them. Once a thorough assessment has been done, a 
basis exists for simplifying the approach and better allocating resources in the future to best reduce uncertainties 
in the results. 
Where a country has estimated its fugitive emissions from part or all of its oil and natural gas system based on a 
roll-up of estimates reported by individual oil and gas companies, it is good practice to document the steps taken 
to ensure that these results are complete, transparent and consistent across the time series. Corrections made to 
account for companies or facilities that did not report, and measures taken to avoid missed or double counting 
(particularly where ownership changes have occurred) and to assess uncertainties should be highlighted. 
4.2.2.6 
DEVELOPING CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
 
Ideally, emission estimates will be prepared for the base year and subsequent years using the same method. The 
aim is to have emission estimates across the time series reflect true trends in greenhouse gas emissions. Emission 
or control factors that change over time (e.g., due to changes in source demographics or the penetration of 
control technologies) should be regularly updated and, each time, only applied to the period for which they are 
valid. For, example, if an emission control device is retrofit to a source then a new emission factor will apply to 
that source from then onwards; however, the previously applied emission factor reflecting conditions before the 
retrofit should still be applied for all previous years in the time series. If an emission factor has been refined

through further testing and now reflects a better understanding of the source or source category, then all previous 
estimates should be updated to reflect the use of the improved factor and be reported in a transparent manner. 
Where some historical data are missing, it should still be possible to use source-specific measurement results 
combined with back-casting techniques to establish an acceptable relationship between emissions and activity 
data in the base year. Approaches for doing this will depend on the specific situation, and are discussed in 
general terms in Volume 1 Chapter 5 of the 2006 Guidelines. 
If emission estimates are developed based on a roll-up of individual company estimates, greater effort will be 
required to maintain time series consistency, particularly where frequent facility ownership changes occur and 
different methodologies and emission factors are applied by each new owner without also carrying these changes 
back through the time series. 
4.2.2.7 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Sources of error that may occur include the following: 
• 
Measurement errors;  
• 
Extrapolation errors; 
• 
Inherent uncertainties of the selected estimation techniques; 
• 
Missing or incomplete information regarding the source population and activity data; 
• 
Poor understanding of temporal and seasonal variations in the sources; 
• 
Over or under accounting due to confusion or inconsistencies in category divisions and source definitions;  
• 
Misapplication of activity data or emission factors; 
• 
Errors in reported activity data; 
• 
Missed accounting of intermediate transfer operations and reprocessing activities (for example, re-treating 
of slop oil, treating of foreign oil receipts and repeated dehydration of gas streams: in the field, at the plant, 
and then following storage); 
• 
Differences in the effectiveness of control devices, potential deterioration of their performance over time 
and missed accounting of control measures.  
Guidance regarding the assessment of uncertainties in emission factors and activity data are presented in the 
subsections below.  
4.2.2.7.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
The uncertainty in an emission factor will depend both on the accuracy of the measurements upon which it is 
based and the degree to which these results reflect the average behaviour of the target source population. 
Accordingly, emission factors developed based on data measured in one country may have one set of 
uncertainties when the factors are applied in that country and another set of uncertainties when they are applied 
similarly in a different country. Thus, while it is difficult to establish one set of uncertainties that will always 
apply, a set of default values has been provided for the default factors provided in Tables 4.2.4 and 4.2.5. These 
uncertainties are estimated based on expert judgement and reflect the level of uncertainty that may be expected 
when the corresponding emission factors are used to develop emission estimates at the national level. Use of the 
presented factors to estimate emissions from individual facilities or sources would be expected to result in much 
greater uncertainties. 
4.2.2.7.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
The percentages cited in this section are based on expert judgement and aim to approximate the 95 percent 
confidence interval around the central estimate. Gas compositions are usually accurate to within ±5 percent on 
individual components. Flow rates typically have errors of ±3 percent or less for sales volumes and ±15 percent 
or more for other volumes. Production statistics or disposition analyses 2 may not agree between different 
                                                           
2  A disposition analysis provides a reconciled accounting of produced hydrocarbons from the wellhead, or point of receipt, 
through to the final sales point or point of export. Typical disposition categories include flared/vented volumes, fuel usage, 
system losses, volumes added to/removed from inventory/storage, imports, exports, etc. 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.73 
reporting agencies even though they are based on the same original measurement results (e.g. due to possible 
differences in terminology and potential errors in summarising these data). These discrepancies may be used as 
an indication of the uncertainty in the data. Additional uncertainty will exist if there is any inherent bias in the 
original measurement results (for example, sales meters are often designed to err in favour of the customer, and 
liquid handling systems will have a negative bias due to evaporation losses). Random metering and accounting 
errors may be assumed to be negligible when aggregated over the industry. 
Counts of major facilities (e.g., gas plants, refineries and transmission compressor stations) will usually be 
known with little if any error (e.g., less than 5 percent). Where errors in these counts occur it is usually due to 
some uncertainties regarding the number of new facilities built and old facilities decommissioned during the time 
period. 
Counts of well site facilities, minor field installations and gas gathering compressor stations, as well as the type 
and amount of equipment at each site, will be much less accurately known, if known at all (e.g., at least ±25 
percent uncertainty or more). 
Estimates of emission reductions from individual control actions may be accurate to within a few percent to ±25 
percent depending on the number of subsystems or sources considered. 
4.2.3 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 6 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines, Tier 1 General Inventory Level QC Procedures, and expert review of the emission estimates. 
Additional quality control checks, as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 5 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and quality 
assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions 
from this source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as 
identified in Volume 1 Chapter 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
In addition to the guidance in Volume 1 Chapter 6 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, specific procedures of 
relevance to this source category are outlined below. 
INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT 
Emission inventories for large, complex oil and gas industries will be susceptible to significant errors due to 
missed or unaccounted for sources. To minimise such errors, it is important to obtain active industry 
involvement in the preparation and refinement of these inventories. 
REVIEW OF DIRECT EMISSION MEASUREMENTS 
If direct measurements are used to develop country-specific emission factors, the inventory compiler should 
establish whether measurements at the sites were made according to recognised standard methods. If the 
measurement practices fail this criterion, then the use of these emissions data should be carefully evaluated, 
estimates reconsidered and qualifications documented.  
EMISSION FACTORS CHECK 
The inventory compiler should compare measurement-based factors to IPCC default factors and factors 
developed by other countries with similar industry characteristics. If IPCC default factors are used, the inventory 
compiler should ensure that they are applicable and relevant to the category. If possible, the IPCC default factors 
should be compared to national or local data to provide further indication that the factors are applicable. 
ACTIVITY DATA CHECK 
Several different types of activity data may be required for this source category, depending on which 
methodological tier is used to estimate the emissions. Where activity data are available from multiple sources (i.e. 
from national statistics and industry organisations) these data sets should be checked against each other to assess 
reasonableness. Significant differences in data should be explained and documented. Trends in the main 
emission drivers and activity data over time should be checked and any anomalies investigated. 
EXTERNAL REVIEW 
Emission inventories for large, complex oil and gas industries will be susceptible to significant errors due to 
missed or unaccounted for sources, or due to customization of average emission factors taken from a data source 
Volume 2 : Energy 
4.74 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
that represents estimates from another country or region with operating characteristics different from those in the 
country where the emission factor is being applied. To minimise such errors, it is important to obtain active 
industry involvement in the preparation and refinement of these inventories. 
4.2.4 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates, as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 8 of the 2006 Guidelines. 
It may not be practical to include all supporting documentation in the inventory report. However, at a minimum, 
the inventory report should include summaries of the methods used and references to source data such that the 
reported emissions estimates are transparent and the steps in their calculation may be retraced. It is expected that 
many countries will use a combination of methodological tiers to evaluate the amount of fugitive greenhouse gas 
emissions from the different parts of their oil and natural gas systems. The specific choices should reflect the 
relative importance of the different subcategories and the availability of the data and resources needed to support 
the corresponding calculations. Table 4.2.9 is a sample template, with some example data entries, that may be 
used to conveniently summarize the applied methodologies and sources of emission factors and activity data.  
Since emission factors and estimation procedures are continually being improved and refined, it is possible for 
changes in reported emissions to occur without any real changes in actual emissions. Accordingly, the basis for 
any changes in results between inventory recalculations should be clearly discussed and those due strictly to 
changes in methods and factors should be highlighted.  
The issue of confidential business information will vary from region to region depending on the number of firms 
in the market and the nature of the business. The significance of this issue tends to increase in progressing 
downstream through the oil and gas industry. A common means to address such issues where they do arise is to 
aggregate the data using a reputable independent third party. 
The above reporting and documentation guidance is applicable to all methodological choices. Where Tier 3 
approaches are employed, it is important to ensure that either the applied procedures are detailed in the inventory 
report or that available references for these procedures are cited since the IPCC Guidelines do not describe a 
standard Tier 3 approach for the oil and gas sector. There is a wide range in what potentially may be classified as 
a Tier 3 approach, and correspondingly, in the amount of uncertainty in the results. If available, summary 
performance and activity indicators should be reported to help put the results in perspective (e.g. total production 
levels and transportation distances, net imports and exports, and specific energy, carbon and emission intensities). 
Reported emission results should also include a trend analysis to show changes in emissions, activity data and 
emission intensities (i.e., average emissions per unit of activity indicator) over time. The expected accuracy of 
the results should be stated and the areas of greatest uncertainty clearly noted. This is critical for proper 
interpretation of the results and any claims of net reductions.  
The current trend by some government agencies and industry associations is to develop detailed methodology 
manuals and reporting formats for specific segments and subcategories of the industry. This is perhaps the most 
practical means of maintaining, documenting and disseminating the subject information. However, all such 
initiatives must conform to the common framework established in the IPCC Guidelines so that the emission 
results can be compared across countries.
