Executive summary
Land degradation affects people and ecosystems throughout 
the planet and is both affected by climate change and 
contributes to it. In this report, land degradation is defined as 
a  negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect 
human-induced processes including anthropogenic climate change, 
expressed as long-term reduction or loss of at least one of the 
following: biological productivity, ecological integrity, or value to 
humans. Forest degradation is land degradation that occurs in forest 
land. Deforestation is the conversion of forest to non-forest land and 
can result in land degradation. {4.1.3}
Land degradation adversely affects people’s livelihoods (very 
high confidence) and occurs over a  quarter of the Earth’s 
ice-free land area (medium confidence). The majority of 
the  1.3 to  3.2  billion affected people (low confidence) are 
living in poverty in developing countries (medium confidence). 
Land-use changes and unsustainable land management are direct 
human causes of land degradation (very high confidence), with 
agriculture being a dominant sector driving degradation (very high 
confidence). Soil loss from conventionally tilled land exceeds the rate 
of soil formation by >2 orders of magnitude (medium confidence). 
Land degradation affects humans in multiple ways, interacting 
with social, political, cultural and economic aspects, including 
markets, technology, inequality and demographic change (very high 
confidence). Land degradation impacts extend beyond the land 
surface itself, affecting marine and freshwater systems, as well as 
people and ecosystems far away from the local sites of degradation 
(very high confidence). {4.1.6, 4.2.1, 4.2.3, 4.3, 4.6.1, 4.7, Table 4.1} 
Climate change exacerbates the rate and magnitude of 
several ongoing land degradation processes and introduces 
new degradation patterns (high confidence). Human-induced 
global warming has already caused observed changes in two drivers 
of land degradation: increased frequency, intensity and/or amount 
of heavy precipitation (medium confidence); and increased heat 
stress (high confidence). In some areas sea level rise has exacerbated 
coastal erosion (medium confidence). Global warming beyond 
present day will further exacerbate ongoing land degradation 
processes through increasing floods (medium confidence), drought 
frequency and severity (medium confidence), intensified cyclones 
(medium confidence), and sea level rise (very high confidence), 
with outcomes being modulated by land management (very high 
confidence). Permafrost thawing due to warming (high confidence), 
and coastal erosion due to sea level rise and impacts of changing 
storm paths (low confidence), are examples of land degradation 
affecting places where it has not typically been a problem. Erosion of 
coastal areas because of sea level rise will increase worldwide (high 
confidence). In cyclone prone areas, the combination of sea level rise 
and more intense cyclones will cause land degradation with serious 
consequences for people and livelihoods (very high confidence). 
{4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.9.6, Table 4.1} 
Land degradation and climate change, both individually 
and in combination, have profound implications for natural 
resource-based livelihood systems and societal groups (high 
confidence). The number of people whose livelihood depends on 
degraded lands has been estimated to be about 1.5 billion worldwide 
(very low confidence). People in degraded areas who directly depend 
on natural resources for subsistence, food security and income, 
including women and youth with limited adaptation options, are 
especially vulnerable to land degradation and climate change 
(high confidence). Land degradation reduces land productivity and 
increases the workload of managing the land, affecting women 
disproportionally in some regions. Land degradation and climate 
change act as threat multipliers for already precarious livelihoods 
(very high confidence), leaving them highly sensitive to extreme 
climatic events, with consequences such as poverty and food 
insecurity (high confidence) and, in some cases, migration, conflict 
and loss of cultural heritage (low confidence). Changes in vegetation 
cover and distribution due to climate change increase the risk of land 
degradation in some areas (medium confidence). Climate change will 
have detrimental effects on livelihoods, habitats and infrastructure 
through increased rates of land degradation (high confidence) and 
from new degradation patterns (low evidence, high agreement). 
{4.1.6, 4.2.1, 4.7} 
Land degradation is a  driver of climate change through 
emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and reduced rates of 
carbon uptake (very high confidence). Since 1990, globally the 
forest area has decreased by 3% (low confidence) with net decreases 
in the tropics and net increases outside the tropics (high confidence). 
Lower carbon density in re-growing forests, compared to carbon stocks 
before deforestation, results in net emissions from land-use change 
(very high confidence). Forest management that reduces carbon 
stocks of forest land also leads to emissions, but global estimates 
of these emissions are uncertain. Cropland soils have lost 20–60% 
of their organic carbon content prior to cultivation, and soils under 
conventional agriculture continue to be a source of GHGs (medium 
confidence). Of the land degradation processes, deforestation, 
increasing wildfires, degradation of peat soils, and permafrost 
thawing contribute most to climate change through the release of 
GHGs and the reduction in land carbon sinks following deforestation 
(high confidence). Agricultural practices also emit non-CO2  GHGs 
from soils and these emissions are exacerbated by climate change 
(medium confidence). Conversion of primary to managed forests, 
illegal logging and unsustainable forest management result in 
GHG emissions (very high confidence) and can have additional 
physical effects on the regional climate including those arising from 
albedo shifts (medium confidence). These interactions call for more 
integrative climate impact assessments. {4.2.2, 4.3, 4.5.4, 4.6}
Large-scale implementation of dedicated biomass production 
for bioenergy increases competition for land with potentially 
serious consequences for food security and land degradation 
(high confidence). Increasing the extent and intensity of biomass 
production, for example, through fertiliser additions, irrigation or 
monoculture energy plantations, can result in local land degradation. 
Poorly implemented intensification of land management contributes 
to land degradation (e.g., salinisation from irrigation) and disrupted 
livelihoods (high confidence). In areas where afforestation and 
reforestation occur on previously degraded lands, opportunities 
exist to restore and rehabilitate lands with potentially significant 
348

co-benefits (high confidence) that depend on whether restoration 
involves natural or plantation forests. The total area of degraded 
lands has been estimated at 10–60  Mkm2 (very low confidence). 
The extent of degraded and marginal lands suitable for dedicated 
biomass production is highly uncertain and cannot be established 
without due consideration of current land use and land tenure. 
Increasing the area of dedicated energy crops can lead to land 
degradation elsewhere through indirect land-use change (medium 
confidence). Impacts of energy crops can be reduced through 
strategic integration with agricultural and forestry systems 
(high confidence) but the total quantity of biomass that can be 
produced through synergistic production systems is unknown. 
{4.1.6, 4.4.2, 4.5, 4.7.1, 4.8.1, 4.8.3, 4.8.4, 4.9.3} 
Reducing unsustainable use of traditional biomass reduces 
land degradation and emissions of CO2 while providing social 
and economic co-benefits (very high confidence). Traditional 
biomass in the form of fuelwood, charcoal and agricultural residues 
remains a  primary source of energy for more than one-third of 
the global population, leading to unsustainable use of biomass 
resources and forest degradation and contributing around  2% of 
global GHG emissions (low confidence). Enhanced forest protection, 
improved forest and agricultural management, fuel-switching and 
adoption of efficient cooking and heating appliances can promote 
more sustainable biomass use and reduce land degradation, with 
co-benefits of reduced GHG emissions, improved human health, 
and reduced workload especially for women and youth (very high 
confidence). {4.1.6, 4.5.4} 
Land degradation can be avoided, reduced or reversed by 
implementing sustainable land management, restoration 
and rehabilitation practices that simultaneously provide 
many co-benefits, including adaptation to and mitigation of 
climate change (high confidence). Sustainable land management 
involves a  comprehensive array of technologies and enabling 
conditions, which have proven to address land degradation at 
multiple landscape scales, from local farms (very high confidence) 
to entire watersheds (medium confidence). Sustainable forest 
management can prevent deforestation, maintain and enhance 
carbon sinks and can contribute towards GHG emissions-reduction 
goals. Sustainable forest management generates socio-economic 
benefits, and provides fibre, timber and biomass to meet society’s 
growing needs. While sustainable forest management sustains high 
carbon sinks, the conversion from primary forests to sustainably 
managed forests can result in carbon emission during the transition 
and loss of biodiversity (high confidence). Conversely, in areas of 
degraded forests, sustainable forest management can increase 
carbon stocks and biodiversity (medium confidence). Carbon storage 
in long-lived wood products and reductions of emissions from use of 
wood products to substitute for emissions-intensive materials also 
contribute to mitigation objectives. {4.8, 4.9, Table 4.2}
Lack of action to address land degradation will increase 
emissions and reduce carbon sinks and is inconsistent with 
the emissions reductions required to limit global warming 
to 1.5°C or 2°C. (high confidence). Better management of soils 
can offset 5–20% of current global anthropogenic GHG emissions 
(medium confidence). Measures to avoid, reduce and reverse land 
degradation are available but economic, political, institutional, legal 
and socio-cultural barriers, including lack of access to resources 
and knowledge, restrict their uptake (very high confidence). Proven 
measures that facilitate implementation of practices that avoid, 
reduce, or reverse land degradation include tenure reform, tax 
incentives, payments for ecosystem services, participatory integrated 
land-use planning, farmer networks and rural advisory services. 
Delayed action increases the costs of addressing land degradation, 
and can lead to irreversible biophysical and human outcomes 
(high confidence). Early actions can generate both site-specific and 
immediate benefits to communities affected by land degradation, 
and contribute to long-term global benefits through climate change 
mitigation (high confidence). {4.1.5, 4.1.6, 4.7.1, 4.8, Table 4.2} 
Even with adequate implementation of measures to avoid, 
reduce and reverse land degradation, there will be residual 
degradation in some situations (high confidence). Limits to 
adaptation are dynamic, site specific and determined through the 
interaction of biophysical changes with social and institutional 
conditions. Exceeding the limits of adaptation will trigger escalating 
losses or result in undesirable changes, such as forced migration, 
conflicts, or poverty. Examples of potential limits to adaptation due 
to climate-change-induced land degradation are coastal erosion 
(where land disappears, collapsing infrastructure and livelihoods 
due to thawing of permafrost), and extreme forms of soil erosion. 
{4.7, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.9.6, 4.9.7, 4.9.8} 
Land degradation is a serious and widespread problem, yet 
key uncertainties remain concerning its extent, severity, and 
linkages to climate change (very high confidence). Despite 
the difficulties of objectively measuring the extent and severity of 
land degradation, given its complex and value-based characteristics, 
land degradation represents  – along with climate change  – one 
of the biggest and most urgent challenges for humanity (very 
high confidence). The current global extent, severity and rates 
of land degradation are not well quantified. There is no single 
method by which land degradation can be measured objectively 
and consistently over large areas because it is such a  complex 
and value-laden concept (very high confidence). However, many 
existing scientific and locally-based approaches, including the use 
of indigenous and local knowledge, can assess different aspects of 
land degradation or provide proxies. Remote sensing, corroborated 
by other data, can generate geographically explicit and globally 
consistent data that can be used as proxies over relevant time 
scales (several decades). Few studies have specifically addressed 
the impacts of proposed land-based negative emission technologies 
on land degradation. Much research has tried to understand how 
livelihoods and ecosystems are affected by a particular stressor – for 
example, drought, heat stress, or waterlogging. Important knowledge 
gaps remain in understanding how plants, habitats and ecosystems 
are affected by the cumulative and interacting impacts of several 
stressors, including potential new stressors resulting from large-scale 
implementation of negative emission technologies. {4.10}

Introduction
1.1.1 
Scope of the chapter
This chapter examines the scientific understanding of how climate 
change impacts land degradation, and vice versa, with a focus on 
non-drylands. Land degradation of drylands is covered in Chapter 3. 
After providing definitions and the context (Section 4.1) we proceed 
with a  theoretical explanation of the different processes of land 
degradation and how they are related to climate and to climate 
change, where possible (Section 4.2). Two sections are devoted to 
a  systematic assessment of the scientific literature on status and 
trend of land degradation (Section  4.3) and projections of land 
degradation (Section 4.4). Then follows a section where we assess 
the impacts of climate change mitigation options, bioenergy and 
land-based technologies for carbon dioxide removal (CDR), on land 
degradation (Section 4.5). The ways in which land degradation can 
impact on climate and climate change are assessed in Section 4.6. 
The impacts of climate-related land degradation on human and 
natural systems are assessed in Section 4.7. The remainder of the 
chapter assesses land degradation mitigation options based on 
the concept of sustainable land management: avoid, reduce and 
reverse land degradation (Section 4.8), followed by a presentation 
of eight illustrative case studies of land degradation and remedies 
(Section 4.9). The chapter ends with a discussion of the most critical 
knowledge gaps and areas for further research (Section 4.10).
1.1.2 
Perspectives of land degradation
Land degradation has accompanied humanity at least since the 
widespread adoption of agriculture during Neolithic time, some 10,000 
to  7,500  years ago (Dotterweich 2013; Butzer 2005; Dotterweich 
2008) and the associated population increase (Bocquet-Appel 2011). 
There are indications that the levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) – 
particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane  (CH4) – in the 
atmosphere already started to increase more than 3,000 years ago as 
a result of expanding agriculture, clearing of forests, and domestication 
of wild animals (Fuller et al. 2011; Kaplan et al. 2011; Vavrus 
et al. 2018; Ellis et al. 2013). While the development of agriculture 
(cropping and animal husbandry) underpinned the development of 
civilisations, political institutions and prosperity, farming practices led 
to conversion of forests and grasslands to farmland, and the heavy 
reliance on domesticated annual grasses for our food production 
meant that soils started to deteriorate through seasonal mechanical 
disturbances (Turner et al. 1990; Steffen et al. 2005; Ojima et al. 1994; 
Ellis et al. 2013). More recently, urbanisation has significantly altered 
ecosystems (Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2). Since around 1850, 
about 35% of human-caused CO2  emissions to the atmosphere 
has come from land as a combined effect of land degradation and 
land-use change (Foley et al. 2005) and about 38% of the Earth’s 
land area has been converted to agriculture (Foley et al. 2011). See 
Chapter 2 for more details. 
Not all human impacts on land result in degradation according to the 
definition of land degradation used in this report (Section 4.1.3). There 
are many examples of long-term sustainably managed land around 
the world (such as terraced agricultural systems and sustainably 
managed forests) although degradation and its management are the 
focus of this chapter. We also acknowledge that human use of land 
and ecosystems provides essential goods and services for society 
(Foley et al. 2005; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). 
Land degradation was long subject to a polarised scientific debate 
between disciplines and perspectives in which social scientists often 
proposed that natural scientists exaggerated land degradation as 
a global problem (Blaikie and Brookfield 1987; Forsyth 1996; Lukas 
2014; Zimmerer 1993). The elusiveness of the concept in combination 
with the difficulties of measuring and monitoring land degradation 
at global and regional scales by extrapolation and aggregation of 
empirical studies at local scales, such as the Global Assessment of 
Soil Degradation database (GLASOD) (Sonneveld and Dent 2009) 
contributed to conflicting views. The conflicting views were not 
confined to science only, but also caused tension between the scientific 
understanding of land degradation and policy (Andersson et al. 2011; 
Behnke and Mortimore 2016; Grainger 2009; Toulmin and Brock 2016). 
Another weakness of many land degradation studies is the exclusion 
of the views and experiences of the land users, whether farmers or 
forest-dependent communities (Blaikie and Brookfield 1987; Fairhead 
and Scoones 2005; Warren 2002; Andersson et al. 2011). More 
recently, the polarised views described above have been reconciled 
under the umbrella of Land Change Science, which has emerged as 
an interdisciplinary field aimed at examining the dynamics of land 
cover and land-use as a coupled human-environment system (Turner 
et al. 2007). A comprehensive discussion about concepts and different 
perspectives of land degradation was presented in Chapter 2 of the 
recent report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform 
on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) on land degradation 
(Montanarella et al. 2018). 
In summary, agriculture and clearing of land for food and wood 
products have been the main drivers of land degradation for millennia 
(high confidence). This does not mean, however, that agriculture and 
forestry always cause land degradation (high confidence); sustainable 
management is possible but not always practised (high confidence). 
Reasons for this are primarily economic, political and social. 
1.1.3 
Definition of land degradation 
To clarify the scope of this chapter, it is important to start by 
defining land itself. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land 
(SRCCL) defines land as ‘the terrestrial portion of the biosphere that 
comprises the natural resources (soil, near surface air, vegetation 
and other biota, and water), the ecological processes, topography, 
and human settlements and infrastructure that operate within that 
system’ (Henry et al. 2018, adapted from FAO 2007; UNCCD 1994). 
Land degradation is defined in many different ways within the 
literature, with differing emphases on biodiversity, ecosystem 
functions and ecosystem services (e.g., Montanarella et al. 2018). In 
this report, land degradation is defined as a negative trend in land 
condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes 
including anthropogenic climate change, expressed as long-term 
350
Chapter 4

reduction or loss of at least one of the following: biological 
productivity, ecological integrity or value to humans. This definition 
applies to forest and non-forest land: forest degradation is land 
degradation that occurs in forest land. Soil degradation refers to 
a subset of land degradation processes that directly affect soil.
The SRCCL definition is derived from the IPCC AR5 definition of 
desertification, which is in turn taken from the United Nations 
Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD): ’Land degradation 
in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas resulting from various 
factors, including climatic variations and human activities. Land 
degradation in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas is a reduction 
or loss of the biological or economic productivity and integrity of 
rainfed cropland, irrigated cropland, or range, pasture, forest, and 
woodlands resulting from land uses or from a process or combination 
of processes, including processes arising from human activities and 
habitation patterns, such as (i) soil erosion caused by wind and/
or water; (ii) deterioration of the physical, chemical, biological, 
or economic properties of soil; and (iii) long-term loss of natural 
vegetation’ (UNCCD 1994, Article 1).
For this report, the SRCCL definition is intended to complement the 
more detailed UNCCD definition above, expanding the scope to all 
regions, not just drylands, providing an operational definition that 
emphasises the relationship between land degradation and climate. 
Through its attention to the three aspects – biological productivity, 
ecological integrity and value to humans  – the SRCCL definition 
is consistent with the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) concept, 
which aims to maintain or enhance the land-based natural capital, 
and the ecosystem services that flow from it (Cowie et al. 2018). 
In the SRCCL definition of land degradation, changes in land condition 
resulting solely from natural processes (such as volcanic eruptions 
and tsunamis) are not considered land degradation, as these are 
not direct or indirect human-induced processes. Climate variability 
exacerbated by human-induced climate change can contribute to 
land degradation. Value to humans can be expressed in terms of 
ecosystem services or Nature’s Contributions to People. 
The definition recognises the reality presented in the literature that 
land-use and land management decisions often result in trade-offs 
between time, space, ecosystem services, and stakeholder groups 
(e.g., Dallimer and Stringer 2018). The interpretation of a negative 
trend in land condition is somewhat subjective, especially where 
there is a trade-off between ecological integrity and value to humans. 
The definition also does not consider the magnitude of the negative 
trend or the possibility that a negative trend in one criterion may 
be an acceptable trade-off for a positive trend in another criterion. 
For example, reducing timber yields to safeguard biodiversity by 
leaving on site more wood that can provide habitat, or vice versa, 
is a trade-off that needs to be evaluated based on context (i.e. the 
broader landscape) and society’s priorities. Reduction of biological 
productivity or ecological integrity or value to humans can constitute 
degradation, but any one of these changes need not necessarily 
be considered degradation. Thus, a  land-use change that reduces 
ecological integrity and enhances sustainable food production 
at a  specific location is not necessarily degradation. Different 
stakeholder groups with different world views value ecosystem 
services differently. As Warren (2002) explained: land degradation is 
contextual. Further, a decline in biomass carbon stock does not always 
signify degradation, such as when caused by periodic forest harvest. 
Even a decline in productivity may not equate to land degradation, 
such as when a  high-intensity agricultural system is converted to 
a lower-input, more sustainable production system. 
In the SRCCL definition, degradation is indicated by a negative trend 
in land condition during the period of interest, thus the baseline is 
the land condition at the start of this period. The concept of baseline 
is theoretically important but often practically difficult to implement 
for conceptual and methodological reasons (Herrick et al. 2019; 
Prince et al. 2018; also Sections 4.3.1 and 4.4.1). Especially in biomes 
characterised by seasonal and interannual variability, the baseline 
values of the indicators to be assessed should be determined by 
averaging data over a number of years prior to the commencement 
of the assessment period (Orr et al. 2017) (Section 4.2.4). 
Forest degradation is land degradation in forest remaining forest. 
In contrast, deforestation refers to the conversion of forest to 
non-forest that involves a loss of tree cover and a change in land use. 
Internationally accepted definitions of forest (FAO 2015; UNFCCC 
2006) include lands where tree cover has been lost temporarily, due 
to disturbance or harvest, with an expectation of forest regrowth. 
Such temporary loss of forest cover, therefore, is not deforestation. 
1.1.4 
Land degradation in previous IPCC reports 
Several previous IPCC assessment reports include brief discussions 
of land degradation. In AR5 WGIII land degradation is one factor 
contributing to uncertainties of the mitigation potential of land-based 
ecosystems, particularly in terms of fluxes of soil carbon (Smith et al. 
2014, p. 817). In AR5 WGI, soil carbon was discussed comprehensively 
but not in the context of land degradation, except forest degradation 
(Ciais et al. 2013) and permafrost degradation (Vaughan et al. 2013). 
Climate change impacts were discussed comprehensively in AR5 WGII, 
but land degradation was not prominent. Land-use and land-cover 
changes were treated comprehensively in terms of effects on the 
terrestrial carbon stocks and flows (Settele et al. 2015) but links to 
land degradation were, to a large extent, missing. Land degradation 
was discussed in relation to human security as one factor which, in 
combination with extreme weather events, has been proposed to 
contribute to human migration (Adger et al. 2014), an issue discussed 
more comprehensively in this chapter (Section  4.7.3). Drivers and 
processes of degradation by which land-based carbon is released to 
the atmosphere and/or the long-term reduction in the capacity of the 
land to remove atmospheric carbon and to store this in biomass and 
soil carbon, have been discussed in the methodological reports of 
IPCC (IPCC 2006, 2014a) but less so in the assessment reports.
The Special Report on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry 
(SR-LULUCF) (Watson et al. 2000) focused on the role of the biosphere 
in the global cycles of GHG. Land degradation was not addressed in 
a comprehensive way. Soil erosion was discussed as a process by which 
soil carbon is lost and the productivity of the land is reduced. Deposition 
351

of eroded soil carbon in marine sediments was also mentioned as 
a  possible mechanism for permanent sequestration of terrestrial 
carbon (Watson et al. 2000, p. 194). The possible impacts of climate 
change on land productivity and degradation were not discussed 
comprehensively. Much of the report was about how to account for 
sources and sinks of terrestrial carbon under the Kyoto Protocol.
The IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events 
and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) (IPCC 
2012) did not provide a definition of land degradation. Nevertheless, 
it addressed different aspects related to some types of land 
degradation in the context of weather and climate extreme events. 
From this perspective, it provided key information on both observed 
and projected changes in weather and climate (extremes) events that 
are relevant to extreme impacts on socio-economic systems and on 
the physical components of the environment, notably on permafrost 
in mountainous areas and coastal zones for different geographic 
regions, but few explicit links to land degradation. The report also 
presented the concept of sustainable land management as an 
effective risk-reduction tool. 
Land degradation has been treated in several previous IPCC 
reports, but mainly as an aggregated concept associated with GHG 
emissions, or as an issue that can be addressed through adaptation 
and mitigation. 
1.1.5 
Sustainable land management (SLM) 
and sustainable forest management (SFM)
Sustainable land management (SLM) is defined as ‘the stewardship 
and use of land resources, including soils, water, animals and plants, 
to meet changing human needs, while simultaneously ensuring the 
long-term productive potential of these resources and the maintenance 
of their environmental functions’ – adapted from World Overview of 
Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT n.d.). Achieving 
the objective of ensuring that productive potential is maintained in 
the long term will require implementation of adaptive management 
and ‘triple loop learning’, that seeks to monitor outcomes, learn from 
experience and emerging new knowledge, modifying management 
accordingly (Rist et al. 2013).
Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) is defined as ‘the stewardship 
and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains 
their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and 
their potential to fulfill, now and in the future, relevant ecological, 
economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, 
and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems’ (Forest Europe 
1993; Mackey et al. 2015). This SFM definition was developed by the 
Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe and 
has since been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
Forest management that fails to meet these sustainability criteria can 
contribute to land degradation. 
Land degradation can be reversed through restoration and 
rehabilitation. These terms are defined in the Glossary, along with 
other terms that are used but not explicitly defined in this section of 
the report. While the definitions of SLM and SFM are very similar and 
could be merged, both are included to maintain the subtle differences 
in the existing definitions. SFM can be considered a subset of SLM – 
that is, SLM applied to forest land.
Climate change impacts interact with land management to determine 
sustainable or degraded outcome (Figure 4.1). Climate change can 
exacerbate many degradation processes (Table 4.1) and introduce 
novel ones (e.g., permafrost thawing or biome shifts). To avoid, reduce 
or reverse degradation, land management activities can be selected 
to mitigate the impact of, and adapt to, climate change. In some 
cases, climate change impacts may result in increased productivity 
and carbon stocks, at least in the short term. For example, longer 
growing seasons due to climate warming can lead to higher forest 
productivity (Henttonen et al. 2017; Kauppi et al. 2014; Dragoni et al. 
2011), but warming alone may not increase productivity where other 
factors such a water supply are limiting (Hember et al. 2017). 
The types and intensity of human land-use and climate change 
impacts on lands affect their carbon stocks and their ability to 
operate as carbon sinks. In managed agricultural lands, degradation 
can result in reductions of soil organic carbon stocks, which also 
adversely affects land productivity and carbon sinks (Figure 4.1).
The transition from natural to managed forest landscapes usually 
results in an initial reduction of landscape-level carbon stocks. The 
magnitude of this reduction is a function of the differential in frequency 
of stand-replacing natural disturbances (e.g., wildfires) and harvest 
disturbances, as well as the age-dependence of these disturbances 
(Harmon et al. 1990; Kurz et al. 1998; Trofymow et al. 2008). 
SFM applied at the landscape scale to existing unmanaged forests can 
first reduce average forest carbon stocks and subsequently increase 
the rate at which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere, because net 
ecosystem production of forest stands is highest in intermediate 
stand ages (Kurz et al. 2013; Volkova et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2014). 
The net impact on the atmosphere depends on the magnitude of the 
reduction in carbon stocks, the fate of the harvested biomass (i.e. use 
in short – or long-lived products and for bioenergy, and therefore 
displacement of emissions associated with GHG-intensive building 
materials and fossil fuels), and the rate of regrowth. Thus, the impacts 
of SFM on one indicator (e.g.,  past reduction in carbon stocks in 
the forested landscape) can be negative, while those on another 
indicator (e.g., current forest productivity and rate of CO2 removal 
from the atmosphere, avoided fossil fuel emissions) can be positive. 
Sustainably managed forest landscapes can have a lower biomass 
carbon density than unmanaged forest, but the younger forests can 
have a higher growth rate, and therefore contribute stronger carbon 
sinks than older forests (Trofymow et al. 2008; Volkova et al. 2018; 
Poorter et al. 2016). 
Selective logging and thinning can maintain and enhance forest 
productivity and achieve co-benefits when conducted with due 
care for the residual stand and at intensity and frequency that 
does not exceed the rate of regrowth (Romero and Putz 2018). In 
contrast, unsustainable logging practices can lead to stand-level 
degradation. For example, degradation occurs when selective logging 
352

(high-grading) removes valuable large-diameter trees, leaving behind 
damaged, diseased, non-commercial or otherwise less productive 
trees, reducing carbon stocks and also adversely affecting subsequent 
forest recovery (Belair and Ducey 2018; Nyland 1992). 
SFM is defi ned using several criteria (see above) and its 
implementation will typically involve trade-offs among these criteria. 
The conversion of primary forests to sustainably managed forest 
ecosystems increases relevant economic, social and other functions 
but often with adverse impacts on biodiversity (Barlow et al. 2007). In 
regions with infrequent or no stand-replacing natural disturbances, 
the timber yield per hectare harvested in managed secondary forests 
is typically lower than the yield per hectare from the fi rst harvest in 
the primary forest (Romero and Putz 2018).
The sustainability of timber yield has been achieved in temperate 
and boreal forests where intensifi cation of management has resulted 
in increased growing stocks and increased harvest rates in countries 
where forests had previously been overexploited (Henttonen et al. 
2017; Kauppi et al. 2018). However, intensifi cation of management 
to increase forest productivity can be associated with reductions in 
biodiversity. For example, when increased productivity is achieved 
by periodic thinning and removal of trees that would otherwise die 
due to competition, thinning reduces the amount of dead organic 
matter of snags and coarse woody debris that can provide habitat, 
and this loss reduces biodiversity (Spence 2001; Ehnström 2001) 
and forest carbon stocks (Russell et al. 2015; Kurz et al. 2013). 
Recognition of adverse biodiversity impacts of high-yield forestry 
is leading to modifi ed management aimed at increasing habitat 
availability through, for example, variable retention logging and 
continuous cover management (Roberts et al. 2016) and through 
the re-introduction of fi re disturbances in landscapes where fi res 
have been suppressed (Allen et al. 2002). Biodiversity losses are also 
observed during the transition from primary to managed forests in 
tropical regions (Barlow et al. 2007) where tree species diversity can 
be very high – for example, in the Amazon region, about 16,000 tree 
species are estimated to exist (ter Steege et al. 2013). 
Forest certifi cation schemes have been used to document SFM 
outcomes (Rametsteiner and Simula 2003) by assessing a  set of

Figure 4.1 |  Conceptual fi gure illustrating that climate change impacts interact with land management to determine sustainable or degraded outcome. 
Climate change can exacerbate many degradation processes (Table 4.1) and introduce novel ones (e.g., permafrost thawing or biome shifts), hence management needs to 
respond to climate impacts in order to avoid, reduce or reverse degradation. The types and intensity of human land-use and climate change impacts on lands affect their carbon 
stocks and their ability to operate as carbon sinks. In managed agricultural lands, degradation typically results in reductions of soil organic carbon stocks, which also adversely 
affects land productivity and carbon sinks. In forest land, reduction in biomass carbon stocks alone is not necessarily an indication of a reduction in carbon sinks. Sustainably 
managed forest landscapes can have a lower biomass carbon density but the younger forests can have a higher growth rate, and therefore contribute stronger carbon sinks, 
than older forests. Ranges of carbon sinks in forest and agricultural lands are overlapping. In some cases, climate change impacts may result in increased productivity and carbon 
stocks, at least in the short term.

criteria and indicators (e.g., Lindenmayer et al. 2000). While many 
of the certified forests are found in temperate and boreal countries 
(Rametsteiner and Simula 2003; MacDicken et al. 2015), examples 
from the tropics also show that SFM can improve outcomes. For 
example, selective logging emits 6% of the tropical GHG annually 
and improved logging practices can reduce emissions by 44% while 
maintaining timber production (Ellis et al. 2019). In the Congo Basin, 
implementing reduced impact logging (RIL-C) practices can cut 
emissions in half without reducing the timber yield (Umunay et al. 
2019). SFM adoption depends on the socio-economic and political 
context, and its improvement depends mainly on better reporting 
and verification (Siry et al. 2005).
The successful implementation of SFM requires well-established and 
functional governance, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms to 
eliminate deforestation, illegal logging, arson, and other activities 
that are inconsistent with SFM principles (Nasi et al. 2011). Moreover, 
following human and natural disturbances, forest regrowth must be 
ensured through reforestation, site rehabilitation activities or natural 
regeneration. Failure of forests to regrow following disturbances will 
lead to unsustainable outcomes and long-term reductions in forest 
area, forest cover, carbon density, forest productivity and land-based 
carbon sinks (Nasi et al. 2011). 
Achieving all of the criteria of the definitions of SLM and SFM is an 
aspirational goal that will be made more challenging where climate 
change impacts, such as biome shifts and increased disturbances, 
are predicted to adversely affect future biodiversity and contribute 
to forest degradation (Warren et al. 2018). Land management to 
enhance land sinks will involve trade-offs that need to be assessed 
within their spatial, temporal and societal context. 
1.1.6 
The human dimension of land degradation and 
forest degradation 
Studies of land and forest degradation are often biased towards 
biophysical aspects, both in terms of its processes, such as erosion 
or nutrient depletion, and its observed physical manifestations, such 
as gullying or low primary productivity. Land users’ own perceptions 
and knowledge about land conditions and degradation have often 
been neglected or ignored by both policymakers and scientists (Reed 
et al. 2007; Forsyth 1996; Andersson et al. 2011). A growing body 
of work is nevertheless beginning to focus on land degradation 
through the lens of local land users (Kessler and Stroosnijder 2006; 
Fairhead and Scoones 2005; Zimmerer 1993; Stocking et al. 2001) 
and the importance of local and indigenous knowledge within land 
management is starting to be appreciated (Montanarella et al. 2018). 
Climate change impacts directly and indirectly on the social reality, 
the land users, and the ecosystem, and vice versa. Land degradation 
can also have an impact on climate change (Section 4.6). 
The use and management of land is highly gendered and is expected 
to remain so for the foreseeable future (Kristjanson et al. 2017). 
Women often have less formal access to land than men and less 
influence over decisions about land, even if they carry out many of 
the land management tasks (Jerneck 2018a; Elmhirst 2011; Toulmin 
2009; Peters 2004; Agarwal 1997; Jerneck 2018b). Many oft-cited 
general statements about women’s subordination in agriculture are 
difficult to substantiate, yet it is clear that gender inequality persists 
(Doss et al. 2015). Even if women’s access to land is changing formally 
(Kumar and Quisumbing 2015), the practical outcome is often limited 
due to several other factors related to both formal and informal 
institutional arrangements and values (Lavers 2017; Kristjanson 
et al. 2017; Djurfeldt et al. 2018). Women are also affected differently 
than men when it comes to climate change, having lower adaptive 
capacities due to factors such as prevailing land tenure frameworks, 
less access to other capital assets and dominant cultural practices 
(Vincent et al. 2014; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Gabrielsson et al. 2013). 
This affects the options available to women to respond to both land 
degradation and climate change. Indeed, access to land and other 
assets (e.g., education and training) is key in shaping land-use and 
land management strategies (Liu et al. 2018b; Lambin et al. 2001). 
Young people are also often disadvantaged in terms of access to 
resources and decision-making power, even though they carry out 
much of the day-to-day work (Wilson et al. 2017; Kosec et al. 2018; 
Naamwintome and Bagson 2013).
Land rights differ between places and are dependent on the 
political-economic and legal context (Montanarella et al. 2018). 
This means that there is no universally applicable best arrangement. 
Agriculture in highly erosion-prone regions requires site-specific 
and long-lasting soil and water conservation measures, such as 
terraces (Section  4.8.1), which may benefit from secure private 
land rights (Tarfasa et al. 2018; Soule et al. 2000). Pastoral modes 
of production and community-based forest management systems 
are often dominated by, and benefit from, communal land tenure 
arrangements, which may conflict with agricultural/forestry 
modernisation policies implying private property rights (Antwi-Agyei 
et al. 2015; Benjaminsen and Lund 2003; Itkonen 2016; Owour et al. 
2011; Gebara 2018).
Cultural ecosystem services, defined as the non-material benefits 
people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, 
cognitive development, reflection, recreation and aesthetic 
experiences (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005) are closely 
linked to land and ecosystems, although often under-represented 
in the literature on ecosystem services (Tengberg et al. 2012; 
Hernández-Morcillo et al. 2013). Climate change interacting with 
land conditions can impact on cultural aspects, such as sense of place 
and sense of belonging (Olsson et al. 2014).
1.2 
Land degradation in the context 
of climate change 
Land degradation results from a complex chain of causes making the 
clear distinction between direct and indirect drivers difficult. In the 
context of climate change, an additional complex aspect is brought 
by the reciprocal effects that both processes have on each other 
(i.e.  climate change influencing land degradation and vice versa). 
In this chapter, we use the terms ‘processes’ and ‘drivers’ with the 
following meanings: 
354
Chapter 4 
Land degradation
4
Processes of land degradation are those direct mechanisms 
by which land is degraded and are similar to the notion of ‘direct 
drivers’ in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework 
(Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). A comprehensive list of 
land degradation processes is presented in Table 4.1.
Drivers of land degradation are those indirect conditions which 
may drive processes of land degradation and are similar to the 
notion of ‘indirect drivers’ in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 
framework. Examples of indirect drivers of land degradation are 
changes in land tenure or cash crop prices, which can trigger land-use 
or management shifts that affect land degradation. 
An exact demarcation between processes and drivers is not possible. 
Drought and fires are described as drivers of land degradation 
in the next section but they can also be a process: for example, if 
repeated fires deplete seed sources, they can affect regeneration and 
succession of forest ecosystems. The responses to land degradation 
follow the logic of the LDN concept: avoiding, reducing and reversing 
land degradation (Orr et al. 2017; Cowie et al. 2018).
In research on land degradation, climate and climate variability are 
often intrinsic factors. The role of climate change, however, is less 
articulated. Depending on what conceptual framework is used, 
climate change is understood either as a process or a driver of land 
degradation, and sometimes both. 
1.2.1 
Processes of land degradation 
A large array of interactive physical, chemical, biological and human 
processes lead to what we define in this report as land degradation 
(Johnson and Lewis 2007). The biological productivity, ecological 
integrity (which encompasses both functional and structural attributes 
of ecosystems) or the human value (which includes any benefit that 
people get from the land) of a  given territory can deteriorate as 
the result of processes triggered at scales that range from a single 
furrow (e.g., water erosion under cultivation) to the landscape level 
(e.g., salinisation through raising groundwater levels under irrigation). 
While pressures leading to land degradation are often exerted on 
specific components of the land systems (i.e., soils, water, biota), once 
degradation processes start, other components become affected 
through cascading and interactive effects. For example, different 
pressures and degradation processes can have convergent effects, 
as can be the case of overgrazing leading to wind erosion, landscape 
drainage resulting in wetland drying, and warming causing more 
frequent burning; all of which can independently lead to reductions 
of the soil organic matter (SOM) pools as a second-order process. 
Still, the reduction of organic matter pools is also a first-order process 
triggered directly by the effects of rising temperatures (Crowther 
et al. 2016) as well as other climate changes such as precipitation 
shifts (Viscarra Rossel et al. 2014). Beyond this complexity, a practical 
assessment of the major land degradation processes helps to reveal 
and categorise the multiple pathways in which climate change exerts 
a degradation pressure (Table 4.1). 
Conversion of freshwater wetlands to agricultural land has historically 
been a common way of increasing the area of arable land. Despite 
the small areal extent – about 1% of the earth’s surface (Hu et al. 
2017; Dixon et al. 2016) – freshwater wetlands provide a very large 
number of ecosystem services, such as groundwater replenishment, 
flood protection and nutrient retention, and are biodiversity hotspots 
(Reis et al. 2017; Darrah et al. 2019; Montanarella et al. 2018). The loss 
of wetlands since 1900 has been estimated at about 55% globally 
(Davidson 2014) (low confidence) and 35% since 1970 (Darrah et al. 
2019) (medium confidence) which in many situations pose a problem 
for adaptation to climate change. Drainage causes loss of wetlands, 
which can be exacerbated by climate change, further reducing the 
capacity to adapt to climate change (Barnett et al. 2015; Colloff et al. 
2016; Finlayson et al. 2017) (high confidence). 
1.2.1.1 
Types of land degradation processes
Land degradation processes can affect the soil, water or biotic 
components of the land as well as the reactions between them 
(Table 4.1). Across land degradation processes, those affecting the 
soil have received more attention. The most widespread and studied 
land degradation processes affecting soils are water and wind 
erosion, which have accompanied agriculture since its onset and are 
still dominant (Table 4.1). Degradation through erosion processes is 
not restricted to soil loss in detachment areas but includes impacts 
on transport and deposition areas as well (less commonly, deposition 
areas can have their soils improved by these inputs). Larger-scale 
degradation processes related to the whole continuum of soil 
erosion, transport and deposition include dune field expansion/
displacement, development of gully networks and the accumulation 
of sediments in natural and artificial water-bodies (siltation) (Poesen 
and Hooke 1997; Ravi et al. 2010). Long-distance sediment transport 
during erosion events can have remote effects on land systems, as 
documented for the fertilisation effect of African dust on the Amazon 
(Yu et al. 2015).
Coastal erosion represents a  special case among erosional 
processes, with reports linking it to climate change. While human 
interventions in coastal areas (e.g., expansion of shrimp farms) and 
rivers (e.g.,  upstream dams cutting coastal sediment supply), and 
economic activities causing land subsidence (Keogh and Törnqvist 
2019; Allison et al. 2016) are dominant human drivers, storms and 
sea-level rise have already left a significant global imprint on coastal 
erosion (Mentaschi et al. 2018). Recent projections that take into 
account geomorphological and socioecological feedbacks suggest 
that coastal wetlands may not be reduced by sea level rise if their 
inland growth is accommodated with proper management actions 
(Schuerch et al. 2018). 
Other physical degradation processes in which no material 
detachment and transport are involved include soil compaction, 
hardening, sealing and any other mechanism leading to the loss 
of porous space crucial for holding and exchanging air and water 
(Hamza and Anderson 2005). A very extreme case of degradation 
through pore volume loss, manifested at landscape or larger scales, is 
ground subsidence. Typically caused by the lowering of groundwater 
or oil levels, subsidence involves a sustained collapse of the ground 
355

surface, which can lead to other degradation processes such as 
salinisation and permanent flooding. Chemical soil degradation 
processes include relatively simple changes, like nutrient depletion 
resulting from the imbalance of nutrient extraction on harvested 
products and fertilisation, and more complex ones, such as 
acidification and increasing metal toxicity. Acidification in croplands 
is increasingly driven by excessive nitrogen fertilisation and, to 
a lower extent, by the depletion of cation like calcium, potassium 
or magnesium through exports in harvested biomass (Guo et al. 
2010). One of the most relevant chemical degradation processes of 
soils in the context of climate change is the depletion of its organic 
matter pool. Reduced in agricultural soils through the increase of 
respiration rates by tillage and the decline of below-ground plant 
biomass inputs, SOM pools have been diminished also by the direct 
effects of warming, not only in cultivated land, but also under natural 
vegetation (Bond-Lamberty et al. 2018). Debate persists, however, on 
whether in more humid and carbon-rich ecosystems the simultaneous 
stimulation of decomposition and productivity may result in the lack 
of effects on soil carbon (Crowther et al. 2016; van Gestel et al. 2018). 
In the case of forests, harvesting – particularly if it is exhaustive, as 
in the case of the use of residues for energy generation – can also 
lead to organic matter declines (Achat et al. 2015). Many other 
degradation processes (e.g.,  wildfire increase, salinisation) have 
negative effects on other pathways of soil degradation (e.g., reduced 
nutrient availability, metal toxicity). SOM can be considered a ‘hub’ 
of degradation processes and a critical link with the climate system 
(Minasny et al. 2017). 
Land degradation processes can also start from alterations in the 
hydrological system that are particularly important in the context 
of climate change. Salinisation, although perceived and reported in 
soils, is typically triggered by water table-level rises, driving salts to 
the surface under dry to sub-humid climates (Schofield and Kirkby 
2003). While salty soils occur naturally under these climates (primary 
salinity), human interventions have expanded their distribution, 
secondary salinity with irrigation without proper drainage being 
the predominant cause of salinisation (Rengasamy 2006). Yet, it has 
also taken place under non-irrigated conditions where vegetation 
changes (particularly dry forest clearing and cultivation) have 
reduced the magnitude and depth of soil water uptake, triggering 
water table rises towards the surface. Changes in evapotranspiration 
and rainfall regimes can exacerbate this process (Schofield and 
Kirkby 2003). Salinisation can also result from the intrusion of sea 
water into coastal areas, both as a result of sea level rise and ground 
subsidence (Colombani et al. 2016).
Recurring flood and waterlogging episodes (Bradshaw et al. 2007; 
Poff 2002), and the more chronic expansion of wetlands over dryland 
ecosystems, are mediated by the hydrological system, on occasions 
aided by geomorphological shifts as well (Kirwan et al. 2011). This 
is also the case for the drying of continental water bodies and 
wetlands, including the salinisation and drying of lakes and inland 
seas (Anderson et al. 2003; Micklin 2010; Herbert et al. 2015). In the 
context of climate change, the degradation of peatland ecosystems 
is particularly relevant given their very high carbon storage and their 
sensitivity to changes in soils, hydrology and/or vegetation (Leifeld 
and Menichetti 2018). Drainage for land-use conversion together 
with peat mining are major drivers of peatland degradation, yet other 
factors such as the extractive use of their natural vegetation and the 
interactive effects of water table levels and fires (both sensitive to 
climate change) are important (Hergoualc’h et al. 2017a; Lilleskov 
et al. 2019). 
The biotic components of the land can also be the focus of 
degradation processes. Vegetation clearing processes associated with 
land-use changes are not limited to deforestation but include other 
natural and seminatural ecosystems such as grasslands (the most 
cultivated biome on Earth), as well as dry steppes and shrublands, 
which give place to croplands, pastures, urbanisation or just barren 
land. This clearing process is associated with net carbon losses from 
the vegetation and soil pool. Not all biotic degradation processes 
involve biomass losses. Woody encroachment of open savannahs 
involves the expansion of woody plant cover and/or density over 
herbaceous areas and often limits the secondary productivity of 
rangelands (Asner et al. 2004; Anadon et al. 2014). These processes 
have accelerated since the mid-1800s over most continents (Van 
Auken 2009). Change in plant composition of natural or semi-natural 
ecosystems without any significant vegetation structural changes is 
another pathway of degradation affecting rangelands and forests. 
In rangelands, selective grazing and its interaction with climate 
variability and/or fire can push ecosystems to new compositions with 
lower forage value and a higher proportion of invasive species (Illius 
and O´Connor 1999; Sasaki et al. 2007), in some cases with higher 
carbon sequestration potential, yet with very complex interactions 
between vegetation and soil carbon shifts (Piñeiro et al. 2010). In 
forests, extractive logging can be a pervasive cause of degradation, 
leading to long-term impoverishment and, in extreme cases, a full 
loss of the forest cover through its interaction with other agents such 
as fires (Foley et al. 2007) or progressive intensification of land use. 
Invasive alien species are another source of biological degradation. 
Their arrival into cultivated systems is constantly reshaping crop 
production strategies, making agriculture unviable on occasions. In 
natural and seminatural systems such as rangelands, invasive plant 
species not only threaten livestock production through diminished 
forage quality, poisoning and other deleterious effects, but have 
cascading effects on other processes such as altered fire regimes and 
water cycling (Brooks et al. 2004). In forests, invasions affect primary 
productivity and nutrient availability, change fire regimes, and alter 
species composition, resulting in long-term impacts on carbon pools 
and fluxes (Peltzer et al. 2010).
Other biotic components of ecosystems have been shown as a focus of 
degradation processes. Invertebrate invasions in continental waters 
can exacerbate other degradation processes such as eutrophication, 
which is the over-enrichment of nutrients, leading to excessive algal 
growth (Walsh et al. 2016a). Shifts in soil microbial and mesofaunal 
composition – which can be caused by pollution with pesticides or 
nitrogen deposition and by vegetation or disturbance regime shifts – 
alter many soil functions, including respiration rates and carbon 
release to the atmosphere (Hussain et al. 2009; Crowther et al. 2015). 
The role of the soil biota in modulating the effects of climate change 
on soil carbon has been recently demonstrated (Ratcliffe et al. 2017), 
highlighting the importance of this lesser-known component of the 
biota as a focal point of land degradation. Of special relevance as both

indicators and agents of land degradation recovery are mycorrhiza, 
which are root-associated fungal organisms (Asmelash et al. 2016; 
Vasconcellos et al. 2016). In natural dry ecosystems, biological soil 
crusts composed of a broad range of organisms, including mosses, 
are a particularly sensitive focus for degradation (Field et al. 2010) 
with evidenced sensitivity to climate change (Reed et al. 2012). 
1.2.1.2 
Land degradation processes and climate change
While the subdivision of individual processes is challenged by their 
strong interconnectedness, it provides a useful setting to identify the 
most important ‘focal points’ of climate change pressures on land 
degradation. Among land degradation processes, those responding 
more directly to climate change pressures include all types of 
erosion and SOM declines (soil focus), salinisation, sodification 
and permafrost thawing (soil/water focus), waterlogging of dry 
ecosystems and drying of wet ecosystems (water focus), and a broad 
group of biologically-mediated processes like woody encroachment, 
biological invasions, pest outbreaks (biotic focus), together with 
biological soil crust destruction and increased burning (soil/biota 
focus) (Table 4.1). Processes like ground subsidence can be affected 
by climate change indirectly through sea level rise (Keogh and 
Törnqvist 2019). 
Even when climate change exerts a direct pressure on degradation 
processes, it can be a  secondary driver subordinated to other 
overwhelming human pressures. Important exceptions are three 
processes in which climate change is a dominant global or regional 
pressure and the main driver of their current acceleration. These are: 
coastal erosion as affected by sea level rise and increased storm 
frequency/intensity (high agreement, medium evidence) (Johnson 
et al. 2015; Alongi 2015; Harley et al. 2017; Nicholls et al. 2016); 
permafrost thawing responding to warming (high agreement, 
robust evidence) (Liljedahl et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2016; Batir et al. 
2017); and increased burning responding to warming and altered 
precipitation regimes (high agreement, robust evidence) (Jolly 
et al. 2015; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Taufik et al. 2017; Knorr 
et al. 2016). The previous assessment highlights the fact that climate 
change not only exacerbates many of the well-acknowledged 
ongoing land degradation processes of managed ecosystems 
(i.e., croplands and pastures), but becomes a dominant pressure that 
introduces novel degradation pathways in natural and seminatural 
ecosystems. Climate change has influenced species invasions and the 
degradation that they cause by enhancing the transport, colonisation, 
establishment, and ecological impact of the invasive species, and also 
by impairing their control practices (medium agreement, medium 
evidence) (Hellmann et al. 2008).
Table 4.1 |    Major land degradation processes and their connections with climate change. For each process a ‘focal point’ (soil, water, biota) on which degradation 
occurs in the first place is indicated, acknowledging that most processes propagate to other land components and cascade into or interact with some of the 
other processes listed below. The impact of climate change on each process is categorised based on the proximity (very direct = high, very indirect = low) and 
dominance (dominant = high, subordinate to other pressures = low) of effects. The major effects of climate change on each process are highlighted together with 
the predominant pressures from other drivers. Feedbacks of land degradation processes on climate change are categorised according to the intensity (very intense 
= high, subtle = low) of the chemical (GHG emissions or capture) or physical (energy and momentum exchange, aerosol emissions) effects. Warming effects are 
indicated in red and cooling effects in blue. Specific feedbacks on climate change are highlighted.

1.2.2 
Drivers of land degradation 
Drivers of land degradation and land improvement are many and they 
interact in multiple ways. Figure 4.2 illustrates how some of the most 
important drivers interact with the land users. It is important to keep 
in mind that natural and human factors can drive both degradation 
and improvement (Kiage 2013; Bisaro et al. 2014).
Land degradation is driven by the entire spectrum of factors, from 
very short and intensive events, such as individual rain storms 
of 10 minutes removing topsoil or initiating a gully or a landslide 
(Coppus and Imeson 2002; Morgan 2005b) to century-scale slow 
depletion of nutrients or loss of soil particles (Johnson and Lewis 
2007,  pp.  5–6). But, instead of focusing on absolute temporal 
variations, the drivers of land degradation can be assessed in relation 
to the rates of possible recovery. Unfortunately, this is impractical 
to do in a spatially explicit way because rates of soil formation are 
difficult to measure due to the slow rate, usually <5mm/century 
(Delgado and Gómez 2016). Studies suggest that erosion rates of 
conventionally tilled agricultural fields exceed the rate at which soil is 
generated by one to two orders of magnitude (Montgomery 2007a). 
The landscape effects of gully erosion from one short intensive 
rainstorm can persist for decades and centuries (Showers 2005). 
Intensive agriculture under the Roman Empire in occupied territories 
in France is still leaving its marks and can be considered an example 
of irreversible land degradation (Dupouey et al. 2002). 
The climate-change-related drivers of land degradation are gradual 
changes of temperature, precipitation and wind, as well as changes 
of the distribution and intensity of extreme events (Lin et al. 2017). 
Importantly, these drivers can act in two directions: land improvement 
and land degradation. Increasing CO2 level in the atmosphere is 
a driver of land improvement, even if the net effect is modulated by 
other factors, such as the availability of nitrogen (Terrer et al. 2016) 
and water (Gerten et al. 2014; Settele et al. 2015; Girardin et al. 2016).
The gradual and planetary changes that can cause land degradation/
improvement have been studied by global integrated models and 
Earth observation technologies. Studies of global land suitability 
for agriculture suggest that climate change will increase the area 
suitable for agriculture by 2100 in the Northern high latitudes by 
16% (Ramankutty et al. 2002) or 5.6 million km2 (Zabel et al. 2014), 
while tropical regions will experience a loss (Ramankutty et al. 2002; 
Zabel et al. 2014). 
Temporal and spatial patterns of tree mortality can be used as an 
indicator of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Episodic 
mortality of trees occurs naturally even without climate change, 
but more widespread spatio-temporal anomalies can be a sign of 
climate-induced degradation (Allen et al. 2010). In the absence of 
systematic data on tree mortality, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 
150 published articles suggests that increasing tree mortality around 
the world can be attributed to increasing drought and heat stress in 
forests worldwide (Allen et al. 2010). 
Other and more indirect drivers can be a wide range of factors such as 
demographic changes, technological change, changes of consumption 
patterns and dietary preferences, political and economic changes, and 
social changes (Mirzabaev et al. 2016). It is important to stress that 
there are no simple or direct relationships between underlying drivers 
and land degradation, such as poverty or high population density, 
that are necessarily causing land degradation (Lambin et al. 2001). 
However, drivers of land degradation need to be studied in the context 
360

of spatial, temporal, economic, environmental and cultural aspects 
(Warren 2002). Some analyses suggest an overall negative correlation 
between population density and land degradation (Bai et al. 2008) 
but we find many local examples of both positive and negative 
relationships (Brandt et al. 2018a, 2017). Even if there are correlations 
in one or the other direction, causality is not always the same. 
Land degradation is inextricably linked to several climate variables, 
such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and seasonality. This 
means that there are many ways in which climate change and land 
degradation are linked. The linkages are better described as a web of 
causality rather than a set of cause–effect relationships. 
1.2.3 
Attribution in the case of land degradation 
The question here is whether or not climate change can be attributed 
to land degradation and vice versa. Land degradation is a complex 
phenomenon often affected by multiple factors such as climatic 
(rainfall, temperature, and wind), abiotic ecological factors (e.g., soil 
characteristics and topography), type of land use (e.g., farming of 
various kinds, forestry, or protected area), and land management 
practices (e.g., tilling, crop rotation, and logging/thinning). Therefore, 
attribution of land degradation to climate change is extremely 
challenging. Because land degradation is highly dependent on land 
management, it is even possible that climate impacts would trigger 
land management changes reducing or reversing land degradation, 
sometimes called transformational adaptation (Kates et al. 2012). 
There is not much research on attributing land degradation explicitly 
to climate change, but there is more on climate change as a threat 
multiplier for land degradation. However, in some cases, it is 
possible to infer climate change impacts on land degradation, both 
theoretically and empirically. Section 4.2.3.1 outlines the potential 
direct linkages of climate change on land degradation based on 
current theoretical understanding of land degradation processes 
and drivers. Section 4.2.3.2 investigates possible indirect impacts on 
land degradation. 
1.2.3.1 
Direct linkages with climate change
The most important direct impacts of climate change on land 
degradation are the results of increasing temperatures, changing 
rainfall patterns, and intensification of rainfall. These changes will, 
in various combinations, cause changes in erosion rates and the 
processes driving both increases and decreases of soil erosion. From 
an attribution point of view, it is important to note that projections 
of precipitation are, in general, more uncertain than projections of 
temperature changes (Murphy et al. 2004; Fischer and Knutti 2015; 
IPCC 2013a). Precipitation involves local processes of larger complexity 
than temperature, and projections are usually less robust than those 
for temperature (Giorgi and Lionello 2008; Pendergrass 2018).
Theoretically the intensification of the hydrological cycle as a result 
of human-induced climate change is well established (Guerreiro

and Knutti 2018) and also empirically observed (Blenkinsop 
et al. 2018; Burt et al. 2016a; Liu et al. 2009; Bindoff et al. 2013). 
AR5 WGI concluded that heavy precipitation events have increased 
in frequency, intensity, and/or amount since 1950 (likely) and that 
further changes in this direction are likely to very likely during the 21st 
century (IPCC 2013). The IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C concluded that 
human-induced global warming has already caused an increase in 
the frequency, intensity and/or amount of heavy precipitation events 
at the global scale (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). As an example, 
in central India, there has been a threefold increase in widespread 
extreme rain events during 1950–2015 which has influenced several 
land degradation processes, not least soil erosion (Burt et al. 2016b). 
In Europe and North America, where observation networks are dense 
and extend over a long time, it is likely that the frequency or intensity 
of heavy rainfall have increased (IPCC 2013b). It is also expected that 
seasonal shifts and cycles such as monsoons and El Niño–Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) will further increase the intensity of rainfall events 
(IPCC 2013).
When rainfall regimes change, it is expected to drive changes in 
vegetation cover and composition, which may be a cause of land 
degradation in and of itself, as well as impacting on other aspects 
of land degradation. Vegetation cover, for example, is a key factor 
in determining soil loss through water (Nearing et al. 2005) and 
wind erosion (Shao 2008). Changing rainfall regimes also affect 
below-ground biological processes, such as fungi and bacteria 
(Meisner et al. 2018; Shuab et al. 2017; Asmelash et al. 2016). 
Changing snow accumulation and snow melt alter volume and timing 
of hydrological flows in and from mountain areas (Brahney et al. 
2017; Lutz et al. 2014), with potentially large impacts on downstream 
areas. Soil processes are also affected by changing snow conditions 
with partitioning between evaporation and streamflow and between 
subsurface flow and surface runoff (Barnhart et al. 2016). Rainfall 
intensity is a  key climatic driver of soil erosion. Early modelling 
studies and theory suggest that light rainfall events will decrease 
while heavy rainfall events increase at about  7% per degree of 
warming (Liu et al. 2009; Trenberth 2011). Such changes result in 
increased intensity of rainfall, which increases the erosive power 
of rainfall (erosivity) and hence enhances the likelihood of water 
erosion. Increases in rainfall intensity can even exceed the rate of 
increase of atmospheric moisture content (Liu et al. 2009; Trenberth 
2011). Erosivity is highly correlated to the product of total rainstorm 
energy and the maximum 30-minute rainfall intensity of the storm 
(Nearing et al. 2004) and increased erosivity will exacerbate water 
erosion substantially (Nearing et al. 2004). However, the effects will 
not be uniform, but highly variable across regions (Almagro et al. 
2017; Mondal et al. 2016). Several empirical studies around the world 
have shown the increasing intensity of rainfall (IPCC 2013b; Ma et al. 
2015, 2017) and also suggest that this will be accentuated with 
future increased global warming (Cheng and AghaKouchak 2015; 
Burt et al. 2016b; O’Gorman 2015). 
The very comprehensive database of direct measurements of water 
erosion presented by García-Ruiz et al. (2015) contains 4377 entries 
(North America: 2776, Europe: 847, Asia: 259, Latin America: 237, 
Africa: 189, Australia and Pacific: 67), even though not all entries are 
complete (Figure 4.3).
An important finding from that database is that almost any erosion 
rate is possible under almost any climatic condition (García-Ruiz 
et al. 2015). Even if the results show few clear relationships 
between erosion and land conditions, the authors highlighted four 
observations (i) the highest erosion rates were found in relation to 
agricultural activities – even though moderate erosion rates were 
also found in agricultural settings, (ii) high erosion rates after forest 
fires were not observed (although the cases were few), (iii) land 
covered by shrubs showed generally low erosion rates, (iv) pasture 
land showed generally medium rates of erosion. Some important

findings for the link between soil erosion and climate change can be 
noted from erosion measurements: erosion rates tend to increase with 
increasing mean annual rainfall, with a peak in the interval of 1000 to 
1400 mm annual rainfall (García-Ruiz et al. 2015) (low confidence). 
However, such relationships are overshadowed by the fact that most 
rainfall events do not cause any erosion, instead erosion is caused 
by a few high-intensity rainfall events (Fischer et al. 2016; Zhu et al. 
2019). Hence, mean annual rainfall is not a good predictor of erosion 
(Gonzalez-Hidalgo et al. 2012, 2009). In the context of climate 
change, it means that the tendency for rainfall patterns to change 
towards more intensive precipitation events is serious. Such patterns 
have already been observed widely, even in cases where the total 
rainfall is decreasing (Trenberth 2011). The findings generally confirm 
the strong consensus about the importance of vegetation cover 
as a  protection against soil erosion, emphasising how extremely 
important land management is for controlling erosion.
In the Mediterranean region, the observed and expected decrease in 
annual rainfall due to climate change is accompanied by an increase 
of rainfall intensity, and hence erosivity (Capolongo et al. 2008). In 
tropical and sub-tropical regions, the on-site impacts of soil erosion 
dominate, and are manifested in very high rates of soil loss, in some 
cases exceeding 100  t  ha–1  yr–1 (Tadesse 2001; García-Ruiz et al. 
2015). In temperate regions, the off-site costs of soil erosion are 
often a greater concern, for example, siltation of dams and ponds, 
downslope damage to property, roads and other infrastructure 
(Boardman 2010). In cases where water erosion occurs, the 
downstream effects, such as siltation of dams, are often significant 
and severe in terms of environmental and economic damages (Kidane 
and Alemu 2015; Reinwarth et al. 2019; Quiñonero-Rubio et al. 2016; 
Adeogun et al. 2018; Ben Slimane et al. 2016).
The distribution of wet and dry spells also affects land degradation, 
although uncertainties remain depending on resolution of climate 
models used for prediction (Kendon et al. 2014). Changes in timing 
of rainfall events may have significant impacts on processes of 
soil erosion through changes in wetting and drying of soils (Lado 
et al. 2004). 
Soil moisture content is affected by changes in evapotranspiration 
and evaporation, which may influence the partitioning of water 
into surface and subsurface runoff (Li and Fang 2016; Nearing et al. 
2004). This portioning of rainfall can have a decisive effect on erosion 
(Stocking et al. 2001).
Wind erosion is a serious problem in agricultural regions, not only in 
drylands (Wagner 2013). Near-surface wind speeds over land areas 
have decreased in recent decades (McVicar and Roderick 2010), 
partly as a  result of changing surface roughness (Vautard et al. 
2010). Theoretically (Bakun 1990; Bakun et al. 2015) and empirically 
(Sydeman et al. 2014; England et al. 2014) average winds along 
coastal regions worldwide have increased with climate change 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Other studies of wind and 
wind erosion have not detected any long-term trend, suggesting 
that climate change has altered wind patterns outside drylands in 
a way that can significantly affect the risk of wind erosion (Pryor 
and Barthelmie 2010; Bärring et al. 2003). Therefore, the findings 
regarding wind erosion and climate change are inconclusive, partly 
due to inadequate measurements. 
Global mean temperatures are rising worldwide, but particularly in 
the Arctic region (high confidence) (IPCC 2018a). Heat stress from 
extreme temperatures and heatwaves (multiple days of hot weather 
in a row) have increased markedly in some locations in the last three 
decades (high confidence), and are virtually certain to continue 
during the 21st century (Olsson et al. 2014a). The IPCC Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5°C concluded that human-induced global 
warming has already caused more frequent heatwaves in most of land 
regions, and that climate models project robust differences between 
present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C and between 1.5°C and 
2°C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). Direct temperature effects on soils 
are of two kinds. Firstly, permafrost thawing leads to soil degradation 
in boreal and high-altitude regions (Yang et al. 2010; Jorgenson 
and Osterkamp 2005). Secondly, warming alters the cycling of 
nitrogen and carbon in soils, partly due to impacts on soil microbiota 
(Solly et al. 2017). There are many studies with particularly strong 
experimental evidence, but a full understanding of cause and effect 
is contextual and elusive (Conant et al. 2011a,b; Wu et al. 2011). This 
is discussed comprehensively in Chapter 2. 
Climate change, including increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, affects 
vegetation structure and function and hence conditions for land 
degradation. Exactly how vegetation responds to changes remains 
a research task. In a comparison of seven global vegetation models 
under four representative concentration pathways, Friend et al. 
(2014) found that all models predicted increasing vegetation carbon 
storage, however, with substantial variation between models. An 
important insight compared with previous understanding is that 
structural dynamics of vegetation seems to play a more important 
role for carbon storage than vegetation production (Friend et al. 
2014). The magnitude of CO2 fertilisation of vegetation growth, and 
hence conditions for land degradation, is still uncertain (Holtum and 
Winter 2010), particularly in tropical rainforests (Yang et al. 2016). 
For more discussion on this topic, see Chapter 2 in this report. 
In summary, rainfall changes attributed to human-induced climate 
change have already intensified drivers of land degradation (robust 
evidence, high agreement) but attributing land degradation to 
climate change is challenging because of the importance of land 
management (medium evidence, high agreement). Changes in 
climate variability modes, such as in monsoons and El Niño–Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) events, can also affect land degradation (low 
evidence, low agreement).
1.2.3.2 
Indirect and complex linkages with climate change 
Many important indirect linkages between land degradation and 
climate change occur via agriculture, particularly through changing 
outbreaks of pests (Rosenzweig et al. 2001; Porter et al. 1991; 
Thomson et al. 2010; Dhanush et al. 2015; Lamichhane et al. 2015), 
which is covered comprehensively in Chapter  5. More negative 
impacts have been observed than positive ones (IPCC 2014b). After 
2050, the risk of yield loss increases as a result of climate change in 
combination with other drivers (medium confidence) and such risks 
363
Land degradation 
Chapter 4

will increase dramatically if global mean temperatures increase by 
about 4°C (high confidence) (Porter et al. 2014). The reduction (or 
plateauing) in yields in major production areas (Brisson et al. 2010; 
Lin and Huybers 2012; Grassini et al. 2013) may trigger cropland 
expansion elsewhere, either into natural ecosystems, marginal arable 
lands or intensification on already cultivated lands, with possible 
consequences for increasing land degradation. 
Precipitation and temperature changes will trigger changes in land 
and crop management, such as changes in planting and harvest 
dates, type of crops, and type of cultivars, which may alter the 
conditions for soil erosion (Li and Fang 2016). 
Much research has tried to understand how plants are affected by 
a  particular stressor, for example, drought, heat, or waterlogging, 
including effects on below-ground processes. But less research has 
tried to understand how plants are affected by several simultaneous 
stressors – which of course is more realistic in the context of climate 
change (Mittler 2006; Kerns et al. 2016) and from a hazards point 
of view (Section  7.2.1). From an attribution point of view, such 
a complex web of causality is problematic if attribution is only done 
through statistically-significant correlation. It requires a combination 
of statistical links and theoretically informed causation, preferably 
integrated into a  model. Some modelling studies have combined 
several stressors with geomorphologically explicit mechanisms  – 
using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model  – and 
realistic land-use scenarios, and found severe risks of increasing 
erosion from climate change (Mullan et al. 2012; Mullan 2013). Other 
studies have included various management options, such as changing 
planting and harvest dates (Zhang and Nearing 2005; Parajuli 
et al. 2016; Routschek et al. 2014; Nunes and Nearing 2011), type of 
cultivars (Garbrecht and Zhang 2015), and price of crops (Garbrecht 
et al. 2007; O’Neal et al. 2005) to investigate the complexity of how 
new climate regimes may alter soil erosion rates.
In summary, climate change increases the risk of land degradation, 
both in terms of likelihood and consequence, but the exact attribution 
to climate change is challenging due to several confounding factors. 
But since climate change exacerbates most degradation processes, it 
is clear that, unless land management is improved, climate change 
will result in increasing land degradation (very high confidence).
1.2.4 
Approaches to assessing land degradation 
In a  review of different approaches and attempts to map global 
land degradation, Gibbs and Salmon (2015) identified four main 
approaches to map the global extent of degraded lands: expert 
opinions (Oldeman and van Lynden 1998; Dregne 1998; Reed 2005; 
Bot et al. 2000); satellite observation of vegetation greenness  – 
for example, remote sensing of Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Plant Phenology 
Index (PPI) – (Yengoh et al. 2015; Bai et al. 2008c; Shi et al. 2017; 
Abdi et al. 2019; JRC 2018); biophysical models (biogeographical/
topological) (Cai et al. 2011b; Hickler et al. 2005; Steinkamp and 
Hickler 2015; Stoorvogel et al. 2017); and inventories of land use/
condition. Together they provide a  relatively complete evaluation, 
but none on its own assesses the complexity of the process (Vogt 
et al. 2011; Gibbs and Salmon 2015). There is, however, a  robust 
consensus that remote sensing and field-based methods are critical 
to assess and monitor land degradation, particularly over large areas 
(such as global, continental and sub-continental) although there are 
still knowledge gaps to be filled (Wessels et al. 2007, 2004; Prince 
2016; Ghazoul and Chazdon 2017) as well as the problem of baseline 
values (Section 4.1.3).
Remote sensing can provide meaningful proxies of land degradation 
in terms of severity, temporal development, and areal extent. These 
proxies of land degradation include several indexes that have been 
used to assess land conditions, and monitoring changes of land 
conditions – for example, extent of gullies, severe forms of rill and 
sheet erosion, and deflation. The presence of open-access, quality 
controlled and continuously updated global databases of remote 
sensing data is invaluable, and is the only method for consistent 
monitoring of large areas over several decades (Sedano et al. 2016; 
Brandt et al. 2018b; Turner 2014).The NDVI, as a proxy for Net Primary 
Production (NPP) (see Glossary), is one of the most commonly used 
methods to assess land degradation, since it indicates land cover, an 
important factor for soil protection. Although NDVI is not a direct 
measure of vegetation biomass, there is a close coupling between 
NDVI integrated over a  season and in situ NPP (high agreement, 
robust evidence) (see Higginbottom et al. 2014; Andela et al. 2013; 
Wessels et al. 2012). 
Distinction between land degradation/improvement and the effects of 
climate variation is an important and contentious issue (Murthy and 
Bagchi 2018; Ferner et al. 2018). There is no simple and straightforward 
way to disentangle these two effects. The interaction of different 
determinants of primary production is not well understood. A key 
barrier to this is a lack of understanding of the inherent interannual 
variability of vegetation (Huxman et al. 2004; Knapp and Smith 
2001; Ruppert et al. 2012; Bai et al. 2008a; Jobbágy and Sala 2000). 
One possibility is to compare potential land productivity modelled 
by vegetation models and actual productivity measured by remote 
sensing (Seaquist et al. 2009; Hickler et al. 2005; van der Esch et al. 
2017), but the difference in spatial resolution, typically 0.5 degrees 
for vegetation models compared to 0.25–0.5 km for remote sensing 
data, is hampering the approach. The Moderate Resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides higher spatial resolution (up 
to 0.25 km), delivers data for the EVI, which is calculated in the same 
way as NDVI, and has showed a robust approach to estimate spatial 
patterns of global annual primary productivity (Shi et al. 2017; Testa 
et al. 2018).
Another approach to disentangle the effects of climate and land use/
management is to use the Rain Use Efficiency (RUE), defined as the 
biomass production per unit of rainfall, as an indicator (Le Houerou 
1984; Prince et al. 1998; Fensholt et al. 2015). A variant of the RUE 
approach is the residual trend (RESTREND) of a NDVI time series, 
defined as the fraction of the difference between the observed NDVI 
and the NDVI predicted from climate data (Yengoh et al. 2015; John 
et al. 2016). These two metrics aim to estimate the NPP, rainfall 
and the time dimensions. They are simple transformations of the 
same three variables: RUE shows the NPP relationship with rainfall 
364
Chapter 4 
Land degradation

for individual years, while RESTREND is the interannual change 
of RUE; also, both consider that rainfall is the only variable that 
affects biomass production. They are legitimate metrics when used 
appropriately, but in many cases they involve oversimplifications and 
yield misleading results (Fensholt et al. 2015; Prince et al. 1998). 
Furthermore, increases in NPP do not always indicate improvement 
in land condition/reversal of land degradation, since this does not 
account for changes in vegetation composition. It could, for example, 
result from conversion of native forest to plantation, or due to bush 
encroachment, which many consider to be a form of land degradation 
(Ward 2005). Also, NPP may be increased by irrigation, which can 
enhance productivity in the short to medium term while increasing 
risk of soil salinisation in the long term (Niedertscheider et al. 2016). 
Recent progress and expanding time series of canopy characterisations 
based on passive microwave satellite sensors have offered rapid 
progress in regional and global descriptions of forest degradation and 
recovery trends (Tian et al. 2017). The most common proxy is vertical 
optical depth (VOD) and has already been used to describe global 
forest/savannah carbon stock shifts over two decades, highlighting 
strong continental contrasts (Liu et al. 2015a) and demonstrating 
the value of this approach to monitor forest degradation at large 
scales. Contrasting with NDVI, which is only sensitive to vegetation 
‘greenness’, from which primary production can be modelled, VOD is 
also sensitive to water in woody parts of the vegetation and hence 
provides a view of vegetation dynamics that can be complementary 
to NDVI. As well as the NDVI, VOD also needs to be corrected to take 
into account the rainfall variation (Andela et al. 2013).
Even though remote sensing offers much potential, its application 
to land degradation and recovery remains challenging as structural 
changes often occur at scales below the detection capabilities 
of most remote-sensing technologies. Additionally, if the remote 
sensing is based on vegetation index data, other forms of land 
degradation, such as nutrient depletion, changes of soil physical 
or biological properties, loss of values for humans, among others, 
cannot be inferred directly by remote sensing. The combination of 
remotely sensed images and field-based approach can give improved 
estimates of carbon stocks and tree biodiversity (Imai et al. 2012; 
Fujiki et al. 2016).
Additionally, the majority of trend techniques employed would be 
capable of detecting only the most severe of degradation processes, 
and would therefore not be useful as a degradation early-warning 
system (Higginbottom et al. 2014; Wessels et al. 2012). However, 
additional analyses using higher-resolution imagery, such as the 
Landsat and SPOT satellites, would be well suited to providing 
further localised information on trends observed (Higginbottom et al. 
2014). New approaches to assess land degradation using high spatial 
resolution are developing, but the need for time series makes progress 
slow. The use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has been shown 
to be advantageous for the estimation of soil surface characteristics, 
in particular, surface roughness and soil moisture (Gao et al. 2017; 
Bousbih et al. 2017), and detecting and quantifying selective logging 
(Lei et al. 2018). Continued research effort is required to enable full 
assessment of land degradation using remote sensing.
Computer simulation models can be used alone or combined with the 
remote sensing observations to assess land degradation. The Revised 
Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) can be used, to some extent, 
to predict the long-term average annual soil loss by water erosion. 
RUSLE has been constantly revisited to estimate soil loss based on 
the product of rainfall–runoff erosivity, soil erodibility, slope length 
and steepness factor, conservation factor, and support practice 
parameter (Nampak et al. 2018). Inherent limitations of RUSLE 
include data-sparse regions, inability to account for soil loss from 
gully erosion or mass wasting events, and that it does not predict 
sediment pathways from hillslopes to water bodies (Benavidez et al. 
2018). Since RUSLE models only provide gross erosion, the integration 
of a further module in the RUSLE scheme to estimate the sediment 
yield from the modelled hillslopes is needed. The spatially distributed 
sediment delivery model, WaTEM/SEDEM, has been widely tested in 
Europe (Borrelli et al. 2018). Wind erosion is another factor that needs 
to be taken into account in the modelling of soil erosion (Webb et al. 
2017a, 2016). Additional models need to be developed to include the 
limitations of the RUSLE models.
Regarding the field-based approach to assess land degradation, there 
are multiple indicators that reflect functional ecosystem processes 
linked to ecosystem services and thus to the value for humans. These 
indicators are a composite set of measurable attributes from different 
factors, such as climate, soil, vegetation, biomass, management, 
among others, that can be used together or separately to develop 
indexes to better assess land degradation (Allen et al. 2011; Kosmas 
et al. 2014). 
Declines in vegetation cover, changes in vegetation structure, decline 
in mean species abundances, decline in habitat diversity, changes in 
abundance of specific indicator species, reduced vegetation health 
and productivity, and vegetation management intensity and use, are 
the most common indicators in the vegetation condition of forest and 
woodlands (Stocking et al. 2001; Wiesmair et al. 2017; Ghazoul and 
Chazdon 2017; Alkemade et al. 2009). 
Several indicators of the soil quality (SOM, depth, structure, 
compaction, texture, pH, C:N ratio, aggregate size distribution and 
stability, microbial respiration, soil organic carbon, salinisation, among 
others) have been proposed (Schoenholtz et al. 2000) (Section 2.2). 
Among these, SOM directly and indirectly drives the majority of soil 
functions. Decreases in SOM can lead to a decrease in fertility and 
biodiversity, as well as a  loss of soil structure, causing reductions 
in water-holding capacity, increased risk of erosion (both wind and 
water) and increased bulk density and hence soil compaction (Allen 
et al. 2011; Certini 2005; Conant et al. 2011a). Thus, indicators related 
with the quantity and quality of the SOM are necessary to identify 
land degradation (Pulido et al. 2017; Dumanski and Pieri 2000). The 
composition of the microbial community is very likely to be positive 
impacted by both climate change and land degradation processes 
(Evans and Wallenstein 2014; Wu et al. 2015; Classen et al. 2015), thus 
changes in microbial community composition can be very useful to 
rapidly reflect land degradation (e.g., forest degradation increased the 
bacterial alpha-diversity indexes) (Flores-Rentería et al. 2016; Zhou 
et al. 2018). These indicators might be used as a set of site-dependent 
indicators, and in a plant-soil system (Ehrenfeld et al. 2005).
365
Land degradation 
Chapter 4

Useful indicators of degradation and improvement include changes 
in ecological processes and disturbance regimes that regulate the 
flow of energy and materials and that control ecosystem dynamics 
under a climate change scenario. Proxies of dynamics include spatial 
and temporal turnover of species and habitats within ecosystems 
(Ghazoul et al. 2015; Bahamondez and Thompson 2016). Indicators 
in agricultural lands include crop yield decreases and difficulty in 
maintaining yields (Stocking et al. 2001). Indicators of landscape 
degradation/improvement in fragmented forest landscapes include 
the extent, size and distribution of remaining forest fragments, an 
increase in edge habitat, and loss of connectivity and ecological 
memory (Zahawi et al. 2015; Pardini et al. 2010). 
In summary, as land degradation is such a  complex and global 
process, there is no single method by which land degradation can 
be estimated objectively and consistently over large areas (very high 
confidence). However, many approaches exist that can be used to 
assess different aspects of land degradation or provide proxies of 
land degradation. Remote sensing, complemented by other kinds 
of data (i.e., field observations, inventories, expert opinions), is the 
only method that can generate geographically explicit and globally 
consistent data over time scales relevant for land degradation 
(several decades).
1.3 
Status and current trends  
of land degradation
The scientific literature on land degradation often excludes forest 
degradation, yet here we attempt to assess both issues. Because of 
the different bodies of scientific literature, we assess land degradation 
and forest degradation under different sub-headings and, where 
possible, draw integrated conclusions. 
1.3.1 
Land degradation 
There are no reliable global maps of the extent and severity of land 
degradation (Gibbs and Salmon 2015; Prince et al. 2018; van der Esch 
et al. 2017), despite the fact that land degradation is a severe problem 
(Turner et al. 2016). The reasons are both conceptual – that is, how 
land degradation is defined, using what baseline (Herrick et al. 2019) 
or over what time period – and methodological – that is, how it can 
be measured (Prince et al. 2018). Although there is a strong consensus 
that land degradation is a reduction in productivity of the land or 
soil, there are diverging views regarding the spatial and temporal 
scales at which land degradation occurs (Warren 2002), and how 
this can be quantified and mapped. Proceeding from the definition 
in this report, there are also diverging views concerning ecological 
integrity and the value to humans. A comprehensive treatment of 
the conceptual discussion about land degradation is provided by 
the recent report on land degradation from the Intergovernmental 
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services 
(IPBES) (Montanarella et al. 2018). 
A review of different attempts to map global land degradation, based 
on expert opinion, satellite observations, biophysical models and 
a database of abandoned agricultural lands, suggested that between 
<10 Mkm2 to 60 Mkm2 (corresponding to 8–45% of the ice-free land 
area) have been degraded globally (Gibbs and Salmon, 2015) (very 
low confidence). 
One often-used global assessment of land degradation uses trends in 
NDVI as a proxy for land degradation and improvement during the 
period 1983 to 2006 (Bai et al. 2008b,c) with an update to 2011 (Bai 
et al. 2015). These studies, based on very coarse resolution satellite 
data (NOAA AVHRR data with a resolution of 8 km), indicated that, 
between 22% and 24% of the global ice-free land area was subject 
to a downward trend, while about 16% showed an increasing trend. 
The study also suggested, contrary to earlier assessments (Middleton 
and Thomas 1997), that drylands were not among the most affected 
regions. Another study using a  similar approach for the period 
1981–2006 suggested that about 29% of the global land area is 
subject to ‘land degradation hotspots’, that is, areas with acute land 
degradation in need of particular attention. These hotspot areas were 
distributed over all agro-ecological regions and land cover types. Two 
different studies have tried to link land degradation, identified by 
NDVI as a proxy, and number of people affected: Le et al. (2016) 
estimated that at least 3.2 billion people were affected, while Barbier 
and Hochard (2016, 2018) estimated that 1.33 billion people were 
affected, of which 95% were living in developing countries. 
Yet another study, using a  similar approach and type of 
remote-sensing data, compared NDVI trends with biomass trends 
calculated by a global vegetation model over the period 1982–2010 
and found that 17–36% of the land areas showed a negative NDVI 
trend, while a positive or neutral trend was predicted in modelled 
vegetation (Schut et al. 2015). The World Atlas of Desertification (3rd 
edition) includes a global map of land productivity change over the 
period 1999 to 2013, which is one useful proxy for land degradation 
(Cherlet et al. 2018). Over that period, about 20% of the global 
ice-free land area shows signs of declining or unstable productivity, 
whereas about 20% shows increasing productivity. The same report 
also summarised the productivity trends by land categories and 
found that most forest land showed increasing trends in productivity, 
while rangelands had more declining trends than increasing trends 
(Figure  4.4). These productivity assessments, however, do not 
distinguish between trends due to climate change and trends due 
to other factors. A recent analysis of ‘greening’ of the world using 
MODIS time series of NDVI 2000–2017, shows a striking increase in 
the greening over China and India. In China the greening is seen over 
forested areas, 42%, and cropland areas, in which 32% is increasing 
(Section 4.9.3). In India, the greening is almost entirely associated 
with cropland (82%) (Chen et al. 2019). 
All these studies of vegetation trends show that there are regionally 
differentiated trends of either decreasing or increasing vegetation. 
When comparing vegetation trends with trends in climatic variables, 
Schut et al. (2015) found very few areas (1–2%) where an increase 
in vegetation trend was independent of the climate drivers, and that 
study suggested that positive vegetation trends are primarily caused 
by climatic factors.

In an attempt to go beyond the mapping of global vegetation trends 
for assessing land degradation, Borelli et al. (2017) used a soil erosion 
model (RUSLE) and suggested that soil erosion is mainly caused in 
areas of cropland expansion, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, South 
America and Southeast Asia. The method is controversial for conceptual 
reasons (i.e., the ability of the model to capture the most important 
erosion processes) and data limitations (i.e., the availability of relevant 
data at regional to global scales), and its validity for assessing erosion 
over large areas has been questioned by several studies (Baveye 2017; 
Evans and Boardman 2016a,b; Labrière et al. 2015).
An alternative to using remote sensing for assessing the state of land 
degradation is to compile field-based data from around the globe 
(Turner et al. 2016). In addition to the problems of definitions and 
baselines, this approach is also hampered by the lack of standardised 
methods used in the field. An assessment of the global severity of 
soil erosion in agriculture, based on 1673 measurements around the 
world (compiled from 201 peer-reviewed articles), indicated that the 
global net median rate of soil formation (i.e., formation minus erosion) 
is about 0.004 mm yr–1 (about 0.05 t ha–1 yr–1) compared with the 
median net rate of soil loss in agricultural fields, 1.52 mm yr–1 (about 
18 t ha–1 yr–1) in tilled fields and 0.065 mm yr–1 (about 0.8 t ha–1 yr–1) 
in no-till fields (Montgomery 2007a). This means that the rate of 
soil erosion from agricultural fields is between 380 (conventional 
tilling) and 16 times (no-till) the natural rate of soil formation 
(medium agreement, limited evidence). These approximate figures 
are supported by another large meta-study including over 4000 sites 
around the world (see Figure 4.4) where the average soil loss from 
agricultural plots was about 21 t ha–1 yr–1 (García-Ruiz et al. 2015). 
Climate change, mainly through the intensification of rainfall, will 
further increase these rates unless land management is improved 
(high agreement, medium evidence). 
Soils contain about 1500  Gt of organic carbon (median across 
28  different estimates presented by Scharlemann et al. (2014)), 
which is about  1.8 times more carbon than in the atmosphere 
(Ciais et al. 2013) and 2.3–3.3 times more than what is held in the 
terrestrial vegetation of the world (Ciais et al. 2013). Hence, land 
degradation, including land conversion leading to soil carbon losses, 
has the potential to impact on the atmospheric concentration of CO2 
substantially. When natural ecosystems are cultivated they lose soil 
carbon that accumulated over long time periods. The loss rate depends 
on the type of natural vegetation and how the soil is managed. 
Estimates of the magnitude of loss vary but figures between 20% 
and 59% have been reported in several meta studies (Poeplau and 
Don 2015; Wei et al. 2015; Li et al. 2012; Murty et al. 2002; Guo and 
Gifford 2002). The amount of soil carbon lost explicitly due to land 
degradation after conversion is hard to assess due to large variation 
in local conditions and management, see also Chapter 2. 
From a  climate change perspective, land degradation plays an 
important role in the dynamics of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane 
(CH4). N2O is produced by microbial activity in the soil and the 
dynamics are related to both management practices and weather

conditions, while CH4 dynamics are primarily determined by the 
amount of soil carbon and to what extent the soil is subject to 
waterlogging (Palm et al. 2014), see also Chapter 2. 
Several attempts have been made to map the human footprint 
on the planet (Čuček et al. 2012; Venter et al. 2016) but, in some 
cases, they confuse human impact on the planet with degradation. 
From our definition it is clear that human impact (or pressure) is 
not synonymous with degradation, but information on the human 
footprint provides a useful mapping of potential non-climatic drivers 
of degradation. 
In summary, there are no uncontested maps of the location, extent 
and severity of land degradation. Proxy estimates based on remote 
sensing of vegetation dynamics provide one important information 
source, but attribution of the observed changes in productivity to 
climate change, human activities, or other drivers is hard. Nevertheless, 
the different attempts to map the extent of global land degradation 
using remotely sensed proxies show some convergence and suggest 
that about a quarter of the ice-free land area is subject to some form 
of land degradation (limited evidence, medium agreement) affecting 
about  3.2  billion people (low confidence). Attempts to estimate 
the severity of land degradation through soil erosion estimates 
suggest that soil erosion is a serious form of land degradation in 
croplands closely associated with unsustainable land management in 
combination with climatic parameters, some of which are subject to 
climate change (limited evidence, high agreement). Climate change 
is one among several causal factors in the status and current trends 
of land degradation (limited evidence, high agreement).
1.3.2 
Forest degradation 
Quantifying degradation in forests has also proven difficult. Remote 
sensing based inventory methods can measure reductions in canopy 
cover or carbon stocks more easiliy than reductions in biological 
productivity, losses of ecological integrity or value to humans. 
However, the causes of reductions in canopy cover or carbon stocks 
can be many (Curtis et al. 2018), including natural disturbances 
(e.g.,  fires, insects and other forest pests), direct human activities 
(e.g., harvest, forest management) and indirect human impacts (such 
as climate change) and these may not reduce long-term biological 
productivity. In many boreal, some temperate and other forest 
types natural disturbances are common, and consequently these 
disturbance-adapted forest types are comprised of a mosaic of stands 
of different ages and stages of stand recovery following natural 
disturbances. In those managed forests where natural disturbances 
are uncommon or suppressed, harvesting is the primary determinant 
of forest age-class distributions. 
Quantifying forest degradation as a  reduction in productivity, 
carbon stocks or canopy cover also requires that an initial condition 
(or baseline) is established, against which this reduction is assessed 
(Section 4.1.4). In forest types with rare stand-replacing disturbances, 
the concept of ‘intact’ or ‘primary’ forest has been used to define the 
initial condition (Potapov et al. 2008) but applying a single metric 
can be problematic (Bernier et al. 2017). Moreover, forest types with 
frequent stand-replacing disturbances, such as wildfires, or with 
natural disturbances that reduce carbon stocks, such as some insect 
outbreaks, experience over time a natural variability of carbon stocks 
or canopy density, making it more difficult to define the appropriate 
baseline carbon density or canopy cover against which to assess 
degradation. In these systems, forest degradation cannot be assessed 
at the stand level, but requires a landscape-level assessment that takes 
into consideration the stand age-class distribution of the landscape, 
which reflects natural and human disturbance regimes over past 
decades to centuries and also considers post-disturbance regrowth 
(van Wagner 1978; Volkova et al. 2018; Lorimer and White 2003).
The lack of a consistent definition of forest degradation also affects 
the ability to establish estimates of the rates or impacts of forest 
degradation because the drivers of degradation are not clearly 
defined (Sasaki and Putz 2009). Moreover, the literature at times 
confounds estimates of forest degradation and deforestation 
(i.e., the conversion of forest to non-forest land uses). Deforestation 
is a change in land use, while forest degradation is not, although 
severe forest degradation can ultimately lead to deforestation. 
Based on empirical data provided by 46 countries, the drivers 
for deforestation (due to commercial agriculture) and forest 
degradation (due to timber extraction and logging) are similar 
in Africa, Asia and Latin America (Hosonuma et al. 2012). More 
recently, global forest disturbance over the period 2001–2015 was 
attributed to commodity-driven deforestation (27 ±  5%), forestry 
(26 ± 4%), shifting agriculture (24 ± 3%) and wildfire (23 ± 4%). 
The remaining 0.6 ± 0.3% was attributed to the expansion of urban 
centres (Curtis et al. 2018).
The trends of productivity shown by several remote-sensing studies 
(see previous section) are largely consistent with mapping of forest 
cover and change using a 34-year time series of coarse resolution 
satellite data (NOAA AVHRR) (Song et al. 2018). This study, based 
on a thematic classification of satellite data, suggests that (i) global 
tree canopy cover increased by 2.24 million km² between 1982 and 
2016 (corresponding to +7.1%) but with regional differences that 
contribute a net loss in the tropics and a net gain at higher latitudes, 
and (ii) the fraction of bare ground decreased by 1.16 million km² 
(corresponding to –3.1%), mainly in agricultural regions of Asia (Song 
et al. 2018), see Figure 4.5. Other tree or land cover datasets show 
opposite global net trends (Li et al. 2018b), but high agreement in 
terms of net losses in the tropics and large net gains in the temperate 
and boreal zones (Li et al. 2018b; Song et al. 2018; Hansen et al. 
2013). Differences across global estimates are further discussed in 
Chapter 1 (Section 1.1.2.3) and Chapter 2. 
The changes detected from 1982 to 2016 were primarily linked to 
direct human action, such as land-use changes (about 60% of the 
observed changes), but also to indirect effects, such as human-induced 
climate change (about 40% of the observed changes) (Song et al. 
2018), a finding also supported by a more recent study (Chen et al. 
2019). The climate-induced effects were clearly discernible in some 
regions, such as forest decline in the US Northwest due to increasing 
pest infestation and increasing fire frequency (Lesk et al. 2017; 
Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Seidl et al. 2017), warming-induced

vegetation increase in the Arctic region, general greening in the Sahel 
probably as a result of increasing rainfall and atmospheric CO2, and 
advancing treelines in mountain regions (Song et al. 2018). 
Keenan et al. (2015) and Sloan and Sayer (2015) studied the 2015 
Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (FAO 2016) and found 
that the total forest area from 1990 to 2015 declined by 3%, an 
estimate that is supported by a global remote-sensing assessment of 
forest area change that found a 2.8% decline between 1990–2010 
(D’Annunzio et al. 2017; Lindquist and  D’Annunzio 2016). The 
trend in deforestation is, however, contradicted between these two 
global assessments, with FAO (2016) suggesting that deforestation 
is slowing down, while the remote sensing assessments finds it to 
be accelerating (D’Annunzio et al. 2017). Recent estimates (Song 
et al. 2018) owing to semantic and methodological differences 
(see Chapter 1, Section 1.1.2.3) suggest that global tree cover has 
increased over the period 1982–2016, which contradicts the forest 
area dynamics assessed by FAO (2016) and Lindquist and D’Annunzio 
(2016). The loss rate in tropical forest areas from 2010 to 2015 is 
55,000 km2 yr–1. According to the FRA, the global natural forest area 
also declined from 39.61 Mkm2 to 37.21 Mkm2 during the period 
1990 to 2015 (Keenan et al. 2015).
Since 1850, deforestation globally contributed 77% of the emissions 
from land-use and land-cover change while degradation contributed 
10% (with the remainder originating from non-forest land uses) 
(Houghton and Nassikas 2018). That study also showed large 
temporal and regional differences with northern mid-latitude forests 
currently contributing to carbon sinks due to increasing forest 
area and forest management. However, the contribution to carbon 
emissions of degradation as percentage of total forest emissions 
(degradation and deforestation) are uncertain, with estimates varying 
from 25% (Pearson et al. 2017) to nearly 70% of carbon losses 
(Baccini et al. 2017). The 25% estimate refers to an analysis of 74 
developing countries within tropical and subtropical regions covering 
22 million km2 for the period 2005–2010, while the 70% estimate 
refers to an analysis of the tropics for the period 2003–2014, but, by 
and large, the scope of these studies is the same. Pearson et al. (2017) 
estimated annual gross emissions of 2.1 GtCO2, of which 53% were 
derived from timber harvest, 30% from woodfuel harvest and 17% 
from forest fire. Estimating gross emissions only, creates a distorted 
representation of human impacts on the land sector carbon cycle. 
While forest harvest for timber and fuelwood and land-use change 
(deforestation) contribute to gross emissions, to quantify impacts on 
the atmosphere, it is necessary to estimate net emissions, that is, the 
balance of gross emissions and gross removals of carbon from the 
atmosphere through forest regrowth (Chazdon et al. 2016a; Poorter 
et al. 2016; Sanquetta et al. 2018).
Current efforts to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations can be 
supported by reductions in forest-related carbon emissions and 
increases in sinks, which requires that the net impact of forest 
management on the atmosphere be evaluated (Griscom et al. 2017). 
Forest management and the use of wood products in GHG mitigation 
strategies result in changes in forest ecosystem carbon stocks, 
changes in harvested wood product carbon stocks, and potential 
changes in emissions resulting from the use of wood products and 
forest biomass that substitute for other emissions-intensive materials 
such as concrete, steel and fossil fuels (Kurz et al. 2016; Lemprière 
et al. 2013; Nabuurs et al. 2007). The net impact of these changes on 
GHG emissions and removals, relative to a scenario without forest 
mitigation actions, needs to be quantified, (e.g., Werner et al. 2010; 
Smyth et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2018). Therefore, reductions in forest 
ecosystem carbon stocks alone are an incomplete estimator of the 
impacts of forest management on the atmosphere (Nabuurs et al. 
2007; Lemprière et al. 2013; Kurz et al. 2016; Chen et al. 2018b). The 
impacts of forest management and the carbon storage in long-lived 
products and landfills vary greatly by region, however, because of 
the typically much shorter lifespan of wood products produced from 
tropical regions compared to temperate and boreal regions (Earles 
et al. 2012; Lewis et al. 2019; Iordan et al. 2018) (Section 4.8.4).
Assessments of forest degradation based on remote sensing of 
changes in canopy density or land cover, (e.g., Hansen et al. 2013; 
Pearson et al. 2017) quantify changes in above-ground biomass 
carbon stocks and require additional assumptions or model-based 
analyses to also quantify the impacts on other ecosystem carbon pools 
including below-ground biomass, litter, woody debris and soil carbon. 
Depending on the type of disturbance, changes in above-ground 
biomass may lead to decreases or increases in other carbon pools, 
for example, windthrow and insect-induced tree mortality may 
result in losses in above-ground biomass that are (initially) offset 
by corresponding increases in dead organic matter carbon pools 
(Yamanoi et al. 2015; Kurz et al. 2008), while deforestation will 
reduce the total ecosystem carbon pool (Houghton et al. 2012). 
A global study of current vegetation carbon stocks (450 Gt C), relative 
to a hypothetical condition without land use (916 Gt C), attributed 
42–47% of carbon stock reductions to land management effects 
without land-use change, while the remaining 53–58% of carbon 
stock reductions were attributed to deforestation and other land-use 
changes (Erb et al. 2018). While carbon stocks in European forests are 
lower than hypothetical values in the complete absence of human 
land use, forest area and carbon stocks have been increasing over 
recent decades (McGrath et al. 2015; Kauppi et al. 2018). Studies by 
Gingrich et al. (2015) on the long-term trends in land use over nine 
European countries (Albania, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom) also show 
an increase in forest land and reduction in cropland and grazing land 
from the 19th century to the early 20th century. However, the extent 
to which human activities have affected the productive capacity of 
forest lands is poorly understood. Biomass Production Efficiency 
(BPE), i.e. the fraction of photosynthetic production used for biomass 
production, was significantly higher in managed forests (0.53) 
compared to natural forests (0.41) (and it was also higher in managed 
(0.63) compared to natural (0.44) grasslands) (Campioli et al. 2015). 
Managing lands for production may involve trade-offs. For example, 
a larger proportion of NPP in managed forests is allocated to biomass 
carbon storage, but lower allocation to fine roots is hypothesised to 
reduce soil carbon stocks in the long term (Noormets et al. 2015). 
Annual volume increment in Finnish forests has more than doubled 
over the last century, due to increased growing stock, improved forest 
management and environmental changes (Henttonen et al. 2017).

As economies evolve, the patterns of land-use and carbon stock 
changes associated with human expansion into forested areas often 
include a period of rapid decline of forest area and carbon stocks, 
recognition of the need for forest conservation and rehabilitation, 
and a  transition to more sustainable land management that is 
often associated with increasing carbon stocks, (e.g., Birdsey et al. 
2006). Developed and developing countries around the world are 
in various stages of forest transition (Kauppi et al. 2018; Meyfroidt 
and Lambin 2011). Thus, opportunities exist for SFM to contribute to 
atmospheric carbon targets through reduction of deforestation and 
degradation, forest conservation, forest restoration, intensification 
of management, and enhancements of carbon stocks in forests and 
harvested wood products (Griscom et al. 2017) (medium evidence, 
medium agreement).
1.4 
Projections of land degradation 
in a changing climate 
Land degradation will be affected by climate change in both direct 
and indirect ways, and land degradation will, to some extent, also feed 
back into the climate system. The direct impacts are those in which 
climate and land interact directly in time and space. Examples of 
direct impacts are when increasing rainfall intensity exacerbates soil 
erosion, or when prolonged droughts reduce the vegetation cover of 
the soil, making it more prone to erosion and nutrient depletion. The 
indirect impacts are those where climate change impacts and land 
degradation are separated in time and/or space. Examples of such 
impacts are when declining agricultural productivity due to climate 
change drives an intensification of agriculture elsewhere, which may 
cause land degradation. Land degradation, if sufficiently widespread, 
may also feed back into the climate system by reinforcing ongoing 
climate change. 
Although climate change is exacerbating many land degradation 
processes (high to very high confidence), prediction of future land 
degradation is challenging because land management practices 
determine, to a very large extent, the state of the land. Scenarios of 
climate change in combination with land degradation models can 
provide useful knowledge on what kind and extent of land management 
will be necessary to avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation. 
1.4.1 
Direct impacts on land degradation 
There are two main levels of uncertainty in assessing the risks of 
future climate-change-induced land degradation. The first level, 
where uncertainties are comparatively low, involves changes of the 
degrading agent, such as erosive power of precipitation, heat stress 
from increasing temperature extremes (Hüve et al. 2011), water 
stress from droughts, and high surface wind speed. The second level 
of uncertainties, and where the uncertainties are much larger, relates 
to the above – and below-ground ecological changes as a result of 
changes in climate, such as rainfall, temperature, and increasing level 
of CO2. Vegetation cover is crucial to protect against erosion (Mullan 
et al. 2012; García-Ruiz et al. 2015). 
Changes in rainfall patterns, such as distribution in time and space, 
and intensification of rainfall events will increase the risk of land 
degradation, both in terms of likelihood and consequences (high 
agreement, medium evidence). Climate-induced vegetation changes 
will increase the risk of land degradation in some areas (where

vegetation cover will decline) (medium confidence). Landslides are 
a form of land degradation, induced by extreme rainfall events. There 
is a strong theoretical reason for increasing landslide activity due 
to intensification of rainfall, but so far, the empirical evidence that 
climate change has contributed to landslides is lacking (Crozier 2010; 
Huggel et al. 2012; Gariano and Guzzetti 2016). Human disturbance 
may be a more important future trigger than climate change (Froude 
and Petley 2018).
Erosion of coastal areas as a result of sea level rise will increase 
worldwide (very high confidence). In cyclone-prone areas (such 
as the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the Bay of Bengal) the 
combination of sea level rise and more intense cyclones (Walsh 
et al. 2016b) and, in some areas, land subsidence (Yang et al. 2019; 
Shirzaei and Bürgmann 2018; Wang et al. 2018; Fuangswasdi et al. 
2019; Keogh and Törnqvist 2019), will pose a serious risk to people 
and livelihoods (very high confidence), in some cases even exceeding 
limits to adaption (Sections 4.8.4.1, 4.9.6 and 4.9.8).
1.4.1.1 
Changes in water erosion risk  
due to precipitation changes
The hydrological cycle is intensifying with increasing warming of 
the atmosphere. The intensification means that the number of heavy 
rainfall events is increasing, while the total number of rainfall events 
tends to decrease (Trenberth 2011; Li and Fang 2016; Kendon et al. 
2014; Guerreiro et al. 2018; Burt et al. 2016a; Westra et al. 2014; 
Pendergrass and Knutti 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement). 
Modelling of the changes in land degradation that are a result of 
climate change alone is hard because of the importance of local 
contextual factors. As shown above, actual erosion rate is extremely 
dependent on local conditions, primarily vegetation cover and 
topography (García-Ruiz et al. 2015). Nevertheless, modelling of soil 
erosion risks has advanced substantially in recent decades, and such 
studies are indicative of future changes in the risk of soil erosion, 
while actual erosion rates will still primarily be determined by land 
management. In a review article, Li and Fang (2016) summarised 205 
representative modelling studies around the world where erosion 
models were used in combination with downscaled climate models to 
assess future (between 2030 to 2100) erosion rates. The meta-study 
by Li and Fang, where possible, considered climate change in terms of 
temperature increase and changing rainfall regimes and their impacts 
on vegetation and soils. Almost all of the sites had current soil loss 
rates above 1 t ha–1 (assumed to be the upper limit for acceptable 
soil erosion in Europe) and 136 out of 205 studies predicted increased 
soil erosion rates. The percentage increase in erosion rates varied 
between 1.2% to as much as over 1600%, whereas 49 out of 205 
studies projected more than 50% increase. Projected soil erosion 
rates varied substantially between studies because the important of 
local factors, hence climate change impacts on soil erosion, should 
preferably be assessed at the local to regional scale, rather than the 
global (Li and Fang 2016).
Mesoscale convective systems (MCS), typically thunder storms, have 
increased markedly in the last three to four decades in the USA and 
Australia and they are projected to increase substantially (Prein et al. 
2017). Using a climate model with the ability to represent MCS, Prein 
and colleagues were able to predict future increases in frequency, 
intensity and size of such weather systems. Findings include the 30% 
decrease in number of MCS of <40 mm h–1, but a sharp increase of 
380% in the number of extreme precipitation events of >90 mm h–1 
over the North American continent. The combined effect of increasing 
precipitation intensity and increasing size of the weather systems 
implies that the total amount of precipitation from these weather 
systems is expected to increase by up to 80% (Prein et al. 2017), 
which will substantially increase the risk of land degradation in terms 
of landslides, extreme erosion events, flashfloods, and so on.
The potential impacts of climate change on soil erosion can be 
assessed by modelling the projected changes in particular variables of 
climate change known to cause erosion, such as erosivity of rainfall. 
A study of the conterminous United States based on three climate 
models and three scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) found that rainfall 
erosivity will increase in all scenarios, even if there are large spatial 
differences – a strong increase in the north-east and north-west, and 
either weak or inconsistent trends in the south-west and mid-west 
(Segura et al. 2014). 
In a study of how climate change will impact on future soil erosion 
processes in the Himalayas, Gupta and Kumar (2017) estimated that 
soil erosion will increase by about 27% in the near term (2020s) 
and 22% in the medium term (2080s), with little difference between 
scenarios. A study from Northern Thailand estimated that erosivity 
will increase by 5% in the near term (2020s) and 14% in the medium 
term (2080s), which would result in a similar increase of soil erosion, 
all other factors being constant (Plangoen and Babel 2014). Observed 
rainfall erosivity has increased significantly in the lower Niger Basin 
(Nigeria) and is predicted to increase further based on statistical 
downscaling of four General Circulation Models (GCM) scenarios, 
with an estimated increase of 14%, 19% and 24% for the 2030s, 
2050s, and 2070s respectively (Amanambu et al. 2019).
Many studies from around the world where statistical downscaling 
of GCM results have been used in combination with process-based 
erosion models show a consistent trend of increasing soil erosion. 
Using a  comparative approach, Serpa et al. (2015) studied two 
Mediterranean catchments (one dry and one humid) using a spatially 
explicit hydrological model  – soil and water assessment tool 
(SWAT) – in combination with land-use and climate scenarios for 
2071–2100. Climate change projections showed, on the one hand, 
decreased rainfall and streamflow for both catchments, whereas 
sediment export decreased only for the humid catchment; projected 
land-use change, from traditional to more profitable, on the other 
hand, resulted in increase in streamflow. The combined effect of 
climate and land-use change resulted in reduced sediment export for 
the humid catchment (–29% for A1B; –22% for B1) and increased 
sediment export for the dry catchment (+222% for A1B; +5% for B1).  
Similar methods have been used elsewhere, also showing the 
dominant effect of land-use/land cover for runoff and soil erosion 
(Neupane and Kumar 2015).

projections (with and without sub-daily rainfall intensity changes), 
showed that erosion rates without land management changes would 
decrease by the 2020s, 2050s and 2100s, irrespective of changes in 
intensity, mainly as a result of a general decline in rainfall (Mullan 
et al. 2012). When land management scenarios were added to the 
modelling, the erosion rates started to vary dramatically for all three 
time periods, ranging from a decrease of 100% for no-till land use, 
to an increase of 3621% for row crops under annual tillage and 
sub-days intensity changes (Mullan et al. 2012). Again, it shows 
how crucial land management is for addressing soil erosion, and the 
important role of rainfall intensity changes.
There is a large body of literature based on modelling future land 
degradation due to soil erosion concluding that, in spite of the 
increasing trend of erosive power of rainfall, (medium evidence, 
high agreement) land degradation is primarily determined by land 
management (very high confidence).
1.4.1.2 
Climate-induced vegetation changes,  
implications for land degradation
The spatial mosaic of vegetation is determined by three factors: the 
ability of species to reach a particular location, how species tolerate 
the environmental conditions at that location (e.g.,  temperature, 
precipitation, wind, the topographic and soil conditions), and 
the interaction between species (including above/below ground 
species (Settele et al. 2015). Climate change is projected to alter the 
conditions and hence impact on the spatial mosaic of vegetation, 
which can be considered a  form of land degradation. Warren 
et al. (2018) estimated that only about 33% of globally important 
biodiversity conservation areas will remain intact if global mean 
temperature increases to  4.5°C, while twice that area (67%) will 
remain intact if warming is restricted to 2°C. According to AR5, the 
clearest link between climate change and ecosystem change is when 
temperature is the primary driver, with changes of Arctic tundra as 
a response to significant warming as the best example (Settele et al. 
2015). Even though distinguishing climate-induced changes from 
land-use changes is challenging, Boit et al. (2016) suggest that 5–6% 
of biomes in South America will undergo biome shifts until 2100, 
regardless of scenario, attributed to climate change. The projected 
biome shifts are primarily forests shifting to shrubland and dry forests 
becoming fragmented and isolated from more humid forests (Boit 
et al. 2016). Boreal forests are subject to unprecedented warming in 
terms of speed and amplitude (IPCC 2013b), with significant impacts 
on their regional distribution (Juday et al. 2015). Globally, tree lines 
are generally expanding northward and to higher elevations, or 
remaining stable, while a reduction in tree lines was rarely observed, 
and only where disturbances occurred (Harsch et al. 2009). There is 
limited evidence of a slow northward migration of the boreal forest in 
eastern North America (Gamache and Payette 2005). The thawing of 
permafrost may increase drought-induced tree mortality throughout 
the circumboreal zone (Gauthier et al. 2015).
Forests are a prime regulator of hydrological cycling, both fluxes of 
atmospheric moisture and precipitation, hence climate and forests 
are inextricably linked (Ellison et al. 2017; Keys et al. 2017). Forest 
management influences the storage and flow of water in forested 
watersheds. In particular, harvesting, forest thinning and the 
construction of roads increase the likelihood of floods as an outcome 
of extreme climate events (Eisenbies et al. 2007). Water balance of 
at least partly forested landscapes is, to a large extent, controlled by 
forest ecosystems (Sheil and Murdiyarso 2009; Pokam et al. 2014). 
This includes surface runoff, as determined by evaporation and 
transpiration and soil conditions, and water flow routing (Eisenbies 
et al. 2007). Water-use efficiency (i.e., the ratio of water loss to 
biomass gain) is increasing with increased CO2 levels (Keenan et al. 
2013), hence transpiration is predicted to decrease which, in turn, will 
increase surface runoff (Schlesinger and Jasechko 2014). However, 
the interaction of several processes makes predictions challenging 
(Frank et al. 2015; Trahan and Schubert 2016). Surface runoff is an 
important agent in soil erosion. 
Generally, removal of trees through harvesting or forest death 
(Anderegg et al. 2012) will reduce transpiration and hence increase 
the runoff during the growing season. Management-induced soil 
disturbance (such as skid trails and roads) will affect water flow 
routing to rivers and streams (Zhang et al. 2017; Luo et al. 2018; 
Eisenbies et al. 2007). 
Climate change affects forests in both positive and negative ways 
(Trumbore et al. 2015; Price et al. 2013) and there will be regional and 
temporal differences in vegetation responses (Hember et al. 2017; 
Midgley and Bond 2015). Several climate-change-related drivers 
interact in complex ways, such as warming, changes in precipitation 
and water balance, CO2 fertilisation, and nutrient cycling, which 
makes projections of future net impacts challenging (Kurz et al. 2013; 
Price et al. 2013) (Section 2.3.1.2). In high latitudes, a warmer climate 
will extend the growing seasons. However, this could be constrained 
by summer drought (Holmberg et al. 2019), while increasing levels 
of atmospheric CO2 will increase water-use efficiency but not 
necessarily tree growth (Giguère-Croteau et al. 2019). Improving one 
growth-limiting factor will only enhance tree growth if other factors 
are not limiting (Norby et al. 2010; Trahan and Schubert 2016; Xie 
et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2015). Increasing forest productivity has been 
observed in most of Fennoscandia (Kauppi et al. 2014; Henttonen 
et al. 2017), Siberia and the northern reaches of North America as 
a response to a warming trend (Gauthier et al. 2015) but increased 
warming may also decrease forest productivity and increase risk of 
tree mortality and natural disturbances (Price et al. 2013; Girardin 
et al. 2016; Beck et al. 2011; Hember et al. 2016; Allen et al. 2011). 
The climatic conditions in high latitudes are changing at a magnitude 
faster than the ability of forests to adapt with detrimental, yet 
unpredictable, consequences (Gauthier et al. 2015). 
Negative impacts dominate, however, and have already been 
documented (Lewis et al. 2004; Bonan et al. 2008; Beck et al. 2011) 
and are predicted to increase (Miles et al. 2004; Allen et al. 2010; 
Gauthier et al. 2015; Girardin et al. 2016; Trumbore et al. 2015). 
Several authors have emphasised a  concern that tree mortality 
(forest dieback) will increase due to climate-induced physiological 
stress as well as interactions between physiological stress and other 
stressors, such as insect pests, diseases, and wildfires (Anderegg et al. 
2012; Sturrock et al. 2011; Bentz et al. 2010; McDowell et al. 2011). 
Extreme events such as extreme heat and drought, storms, and floods 
372

also pose increased threats to forests in both high – and low-latitude 
forests (Lindner et al. 2010; Mokria et al. 2015). However, comparing 
observed forest dieback with modelled climate-induced damages did 
not show a general link between climate change and forest dieback 
(Steinkamp and Hickler 2015). Forests are subject to increasing 
frequency and intensity of wildfires which is projected to increase 
substantially with continued climate change (Price et al. 2013) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2, and Chapter 2). In the tropics, 
interaction between climate change, CO2 and fire could lead to 
abrupt shifts between woodland – and grassland-dominated states 
in the future (Shanahan et al. 2016). 
Within the tropics, much research has been devoted to understanding 
how climate change may alter regional suitability of various crops. 
For example, coffee is expected to be highly sensitive to both 
temperature and precipitation changes, both in terms of growth and 
yield, and in terms of increasing problems of pests (Ovalle-Rivera 
et al. 2015). Some studies conclude that the global area of coffee 
production will decrease by 50% (Bunn et al. 2015). Due to increased 
heat stress, the suitability of Arabica coffee is expected to deteriorate 
in Mesoamerica, while it can improve in high-altitude areas in 
South America. The general pattern is that the climatic suitability for 
Arabica coffee will deteriorate at low altitudes of the tropics as well 
as at the higher latitudes (Ovalle-Rivera et al. 2015). This means that 
climate change in and of itself can render unsustainable previously 
sustainable land-use and land management practices, and vice versa 
(Laderach et al. 2011). 
Rangelands are projected to change in complex ways due to climate 
change. Increasing levels of atmospheric CO2 directly stimulate plant 
growth and can potentially compensate for negative effects from 
drying by increasing rain-use efficiency. But the positive effect of 
increasing CO2 will be mediated by other environmental conditions, 
primarily water availability, but also nutrient cycling, fire regimes 
and invasive species. Studies over the North American rangelands 
suggest, for example, that warmer and dryer climatic conditions will 
reduce NPP in the southern Great Plains, the Southwest, and northern 
Mexico, but warmer and wetter conditions will increase NPP in the 
northern Plains and southern Canada (Polley et al. 2013).
1.4.1.3 
Coastal erosion 
Coastal erosion is expected to increase dramatically by sea level 
rise and, in some areas, in combination with increasing intensity of 
cyclones (highlighted in Section 4.9.6) and cyclone-induced coastal 
erosion. Coastal regions are also characterised by high population 
density, particularly in Asia (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, 
Vietnam), whereas the highest population increase in coastal regions 
is projected in Africa (East Africa, Egypt, and West Africa) (Neumann 
et al. 2015). For coastal regions worldwide, and particularly in 
developing countries with high population density in low-lying 
coastal areas, limiting the warming to 1.5°C to 2.0°C will have major 
socio-economic benefits compared with higher temperature scenarios 
(IPCC 2018a; Nicholls et al. 2018). For more in-depth discussions on 
coastal process, please refer to Chapter 4 of the IPCC Special Report 
on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (IPCC SROCC).
Despite the uncertainty related to the responses of the large ice 
sheets of Greenland and west Antarctica, climate-change-induced 
sea level rise is largely accepted and represents one of the biggest 
threats faced by coastal communities and ecosystems (Nicholls et al. 
2011; Cazenave and Cozannet 2014; DeConto and Pollard 2016; 
Mengel et al. 2016). With significant socio-economic effects, the 
physical impacts of projected sea level rise, notably coastal erosion, 
have received considerable scientific attention (Nicholls et al. 2011; 
Rahmstorf 2010; Hauer et al. 2016). 
Rates of coastal erosion or recession will increase due to rising sea 
levels and, in some regions, also in combination with increasing 
oceans waves (Day and Hodges 2018; Thomson and Rogers 2014; 
McInnes et al. 2011; Mori et al. 2010), lack or absence of sea-ice 
(Savard et al. 2009; Thomson and Rogers 2014) thawing of 
permafrost (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), and changing cyclone 
paths (Tamarin-Brodsky and Kaspi 2017; Lin and Emanuel 2016a). 
The respective role of the different climate factors in the coastal 
erosion process will vary spatially. Some studies have shown that 
the role of sea level rise on the coastal erosion process can be less 
important than other climate factors, like wave heights, changes in the 
frequency of the storms, and the cryogenic processes (Ruggiero 2013; 
Savard et al. 2009). Therefore, in order to have a complete picture 
of the potential effects of sea level rise on rates of coastal erosion, 
it is crucial to consider the combined effects of the aforementioned 
climate controls and the geomorphology of the coast under study. 
Coastal wetlands around the world are sensitive to sea level rise. 
Projections of the impacts on global coastlines are inconclusive, with 
some projections suggesting that 20% to 90% (depending on sea 
level rise scenario) of present day wetlands will disappear during 
the 21st century (Spencer et al. 2016). Another study, which included 
natural feedback processes and management responses, suggested 
that coastal wetlands may actually increase (Schuerch et al. 2018). 
Low-lying coastal areas in the tropics are particularly subject to the 
combined effect of sea level rise and increasing intensity of tropical 
cyclones, conditions that, in many cases, pose limits to adaptation 
(Section 4.8.5.1). 
Many large coastal deltas are subject to the additional stress of 
shrinking deltas as a consequence of the combined effect of reduced 
sediment loads from rivers due to damming and water use, and land 
subsidence resulting from extraction of ground water or natural gas, 
and aquaculture (Higgins et al. 2013; Tessler et al. 2016; Minderhoud 
et al. 2017; Tessler et al. 2015; Brown and Nicholls 2015; Szabo et al. 
2016; Yang et al. 2019; Shirzaei and Bürgmann 2018; Wang et al. 
2018; Fuangswasdi et al. 2019). In some cases the rate of subsidence 
can outpace the rate of sea level rise by one order of magnitude 
(Minderhoud et al. 2017) or even two (Higgins et al. 2013). Recent 
findings from the Mississippi Delta raise the risk of a  systematic 
underestimation of the rate of land subsidence in coastal deltas 
(Keogh and Törnqvist 2019).
In sum, from a  land degradation point of view, low-lying coastal 
areas are particularly exposed to the nexus of climate change 
and increasing concentration of people (Elliott et al. 2014) (robust 
373

evidence, high agreement) and the situation will become particularly 
acute in delta areas shrinking from both reduced sediment loads and 
land subsidence (robust evidence, high agreement). 
1.4.2 
Indirect impacts on land degradation
Indirect impacts of climate change on land degradation are difficult to 
quantify because of the many conflating factors. The causes of land-use 
change are complex, combining physical, biological and socio-economic 
drivers (Lambin et al. 2001; Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011). One such 
driver of land-use change is the degradation of agricultural land, 
which can result in a negative cycle of natural land being converted 
to agricultural land to sustain production levels. The intensive 
management of agricultural land can lead to a loss of soil function, 
negatively impacting on the many ecosystem services provided by soils, 
including maintenance of water quality and soil carbon sequestration 
(Smith et al. 2016a). The degradation of soil quality due to cropping 
is of particular concern in tropical regions, where it results in a loss 
of productive potential of the land, affecting regional food security 
and driving conversion of non-agricultural land, such as forestry, to 
agriculture (Lambin et al. 2003; Drescher et al. 2016; Van der Laan et al. 
2017). Climate change will exacerbate these negative cycles unless 
sustainable land management practices are implemented. 
Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity (see Chapter 5) 
will have implications for the intensity of land use and hence 
exacerbate the risk of increasing land degradation. There will be both 
localised effects (i.e., climate change impacts on productivity affecting 
land use in the same region) and teleconnections (i.e., climate change 
impacts and land-use changes that are spatially and temporally 
separate) (Wicke et al. 2012; Pielke et al. 2007). If global temperature 
increases beyond 3°C it will have negative yield impacts on all crops 
(Porter et al. 2014) which, in combination with a doubling of demands 
by 2050 (Tilman et al. 2011), and increasing competition for land 
from the expansion of negative emissions technologies (IPCC 2018a; 
Schleussner et al. 2016), will exert strong pressure on agricultural 
lands and food security.
In sum, reduced productivity of most agricultural crops will drive 
land-use changes worldwide (robust evidence, medium agreement), 
but predicting how this will impact on land degradation is 
challenging because of several conflating factors. Social change, 
such as widespread changes in dietary preferences, will have a huge 
impact on agriculture and hence land degradation (medium evidence, 
high agreement).
1.5 
Impacts of bioenergy and 
technologies for CO2 removal (CDR) 
on land degradation 
1.5.1 
Potential scale of bioenergy and land-based CDR 
In addition to the traditional land-use drivers (e.g.,  population 
growth, agricultural expansion, forest management), a new driver 
will interact to increase competition for land throughout this century: 
the potential large-scale implementation of land-based technologies 
for CO2 removal (CDR). Land-based CDR includes afforestation and 
reforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), 
soil carbon management, biochar and enhanced weathering (Smith 
et al. 2015; Smith 2016). 
Most scenarios, including two of the four pathways in the IPCC 
Special Report on 1.5°C (IPCC 2018a), compatible with stabilisation 
at 2°C involve substantial areas devoted to land-based CDR, 
specifically afforestation/reforestation and BECCS (Schleussner 
et al. 2016; Smith et al. 2016b; Mander et al. 2017). Even larger 
land areas are required in most scenarios aimed at keeping average 
global temperature increases to below  1.5°C, and scenarios that 
avoid BECCS also require large areas of energy crops in many cases 
(IPCC 2018b), although some options with strict demand-side 
management avoid this need (Grubler et al. 2018). Consequently, the 
addition of carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems to bioenergy 
facilities enhances mitigation benefits because it increases the 
carbon retention time and reduces emissions relative to bioenergy 
facilities without CCS. The IPCC SR15 states that, ‘When considering 
pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the 
full set of scenarios shows a conversion of 0.5–11 Mkm2 of pasture 
into 0–6 Mkm2 for energy crops, a 2 Mkm2 reduction to 9.5 Mkm2 
increase [in] forest, and a 4 Mkm2 decrease to a 2.5 Mkm2 increase 
in non-pasture agricultural land for food and feed crops by 2050 
relative to 2010.’ (Rogelj et al. 2018, p. 145). For comparison, the 
global cropland area in 2010 was 15.9 Mkm2 (Table 1.1), and Woods 
et al. (2015) estimate that the area of abandoned and degraded land 
potentially available for energy crops (or afforestation/reforestation) 
exceeds 5 Mkm2. However, the area of available land has long been 
debated, as much marginal land is subject to customary land tenure 
and used informally, often by impoverished communities (Baka 2013, 
2014; Haberl et al. 2013; Young 1999). Thus, as noted in SR15, ‘The 
implementation of land-based mitigation options would require 
overcoming socio-economic, institutional, technological, financing 
and environmental barriers that differ across regions.’ (IPCC, 
2018a, p. 18). 
The wide range of estimates reflects the large differences among the 
pathways, availability of land in various productivity classes, types of 
negative emission technology implemented, uncertainties in computer 
models, and social and economic barriers to implementation (Fuss et 
al. 2018; Nemet et al. 2018; Minx et al. 2018).
1.5.2 
Risks of land degradation from expansion 
of bioenergy and land-based CDR 
The large-scale implementation of high-intensity dedicated energy 
crops, and harvest of crop and forest residues for bioenergy, could 
contribute to increases in the area of degraded lands: intensive land 
management can result in nutrient depletion, over-fertilisation and 
soil acidification, salinisation (from irrigation without adequate 
drainage), wet ecosystems drying (from increased evapotranspiration), 
as well as novel erosion and compaction processes (from high-impact 
biomass harvesting disturbances) and other land degradation 
processes described in Section 4.2.1. 
374
Chapter 4 
Land degradation

Global integrated assessment models used in the analysis of 
mitigation pathways vary in their approaches to modelling CDR 
(Bauer et al. 2018) and the outputs have large uncertainties due to 
their limited capability to consider site-specific details (Krause et al. 
2018). Spatial resolutions vary from 11 world regions to 0.25 degrees 
gridcells (Bauer et al. 2018). While model projections identify potential 
areas for CDR implementation (Heck et al. 2018), the interaction 
with climate-change-induced biome shifts, available land and its 
vulnerability to degradation are unknown. The crop/forest types and 
management practices that will be implemented are also unknown, 
and will be influenced by local incentives and regulations. While 
it is therefore currently not possible to project the area at risk of 
degradation from the implementation of land-based CDR, there is 
a clear risk that expansion of energy crops at the scale anticipated could 
put significant strain on land systems, biosphere integrity, freshwater 
supply and biogeochemical flows (Heck et al. 2018). Similarly, 
extraction of biomass for energy from existing forests, particularly 
where stumps are utilised, can impact on soil health (de Jong et al. 
2017). Reforestation and afforestation present a lower risk of land 
degradation and may in fact reverse degradation (Section  4.5.3) 
although potential adverse hydrological and biodiversity impacts will 
need to be managed (Caldwell et al. 2018; Brinkman et al. 2017). Soil 
carbon management can deliver negative emissions while reducing 
or reversing land degradation. Chapter 6 discusses the significance of 
context and management in determining environmental impacts of 
implementation of land-based options. 
1.5.3 
Potential contributions of land-based CDR 
to reducing and reversing land degradation 
Although large-scale implementation of land-based CDR has 
significant potential risks, the need for negative emissions and 
the anticipated investments to implement such technologies can 
also create significant opportunities. Investments into land-based 
CDR can contribute to halting and reversing land degradation, to 
the restoration or rehabilitation of degraded and marginal lands 
(Chazdon and Uriarte 2016; Fritsche et al. 2017) and can contribute 
to the goals of LDN (Orr et al. 2017). 
Estimates of the global area of degraded land range from less than 
10 to 60 Mkm2 (Gibbs and Salmon 2015) (Section 4.3.1). Additionally, 
large areas are classified as marginal lands and may be suitable for 
the implementation of bioenergy and land-based CDR (Woods et al. 
2015). The yield per hectare of marginal and degraded lands is lower 
than on fertile lands, and if CDR will be implemented on marginal 
and degraded lands, this will increase the area demand and costs per 
unit area of achieving negative emissions (Fritsche et al. 2017). The 
selection of lands suitable for CDR must be considered carefully to 
reduce conflicts with existing users, to assess the possible trade-offs 
in biodiversity contributions of the original and the CDR land uses, to 
quantify the impacts on water budgets, and to ensure sustainability 
of the CDR land use. 
Land use and land condition prior to the implementation of CDR 
affect climate change benefits (Harper et al. 2018). Afforestation/
reforestation on degraded lands can increase carbon stocks in 
vegetation and soil, increase carbon sinks (Amichev et al. 2012), 
and deliver co-benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services, 
particularly if a diversity of local species are used. Afforestation and 
reforestation on native grasslands can reduce soil carbon stocks, 
although the loss is typically more than compensated by increases in 
biomass and dead organic matter carbon stocks (Bárcena et al. 2014; 
Li et al. 2012; Ovalle-Rivera et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2013), and may 
impact on biodiversity (Li et al. 2012). 
Strategic incorporation of energy crops into agricultural production 
systems, applying an integrated landscape management approach, 
can provide co-benefits for management of land degradation and 
other environmental objectives. For example, buffers of Miscanthus 
and other grasses can enhance soil carbon and reduce water 
pollution (Cacho et al. 2018; Odgaard et al. 2019), and strip-planting 
of short-rotation tree crops can reduce the water table where crops 
are affected by dryland salinity (Robinson et al. 2006). Shifting to 
perennial grain crops has the potential to combine food production 
with carbon sequestration at a higher rate than annual grain crops 
and avoid the trade-off between food production and climate change 
mitigation (Crews et al. 2018; de Olivera et al. 2018; Ryan et al. 2018) 
(Section 4.9.2).
Changes in land cover can affect surface reflectance, water balances 
and emissions of volatile organic compounds and thus the non-GHG 
impacts on the climate system from afforestation/reforestation or 
planting energy crops (Anderson et al. 2011; Bala et al. 2007; Betts 
2000; Betts et al. 2007) (see Section 4.6 for further details). Some of 
these impacts reinforce the GHG mitigation benefits, while others offset 
the benefits, with strong local (slope, aspect) and regional (boreal vs. 
tropical biomes) differences in the outcomes (Li et al. 2015). Adverse 
effects on albedo from afforestation with evergreen conifers in boreal 
zones can be reduced through planting of broadleaf deciduous species 
(Astrup et al. 2018; Cai et al. 2011a; Anderson et al. 2011).
Combining CDR technologies may prove synergistic. Two soil 
management techniques with an explicit focus on increasing the 
soil carbon content rather than promoting soil conservation more 
broadly have been suggested: addition of biochar to agricultural 
soils (Section 4.9.5) and addition of ground silicate minerals to soils 
in order to take up atmospheric CO2 through chemical weathering 
(Taylor et al. 2017; Haque et al. 2019; Beerling 2017; Strefler et al. 
2018). The addition of biochar is comparatively well understood and 
also field tested at large scale, see Section 4.9.5 for a comprehensive 
discussion. The addition of silicate minerals to soils is still highly 
uncertain in terms of its potential (from 95 GtCO2 yr–1 (Strefler et al. 
2018) to only 2–4 GtCO2 yr–1 (Fuss et al. 2018)) and costs (Schlesinger 
and Amundson 2018).
Effectively addressing land degradation through implementation 
of bioenergy and land-based CDR will require site-specific local 
knowledge, matching of species with the local land, water balance, 
nutrient and climatic conditions, ongoing monitoring and, where 
necessary, adaptation of land management to ensure sustainability 
under global change (Fritsche et al. 2017). Effective land governance 
mechanisms including integrated land-use planning, along with 
strong sustainability standards could support deployment of 
375

energy crops and afforestation/reforestation at appropriate scales 
and geographical contexts (Fritsche et al. 2017). Capacity-building 
and technology transfer through the international cooperation 
mechanisms of the Paris Agreement could support such efforts. 
Modelling to inform policy development is most useful when 
undertaken with close interaction between model developers and 
other stakeholders including policymakers to ensure that models 
account for real world constraints (Dooley and Kartha 2018). 
International initiatives to restore lands, such as the Bonn Challenge 
(Verdone and Seidl 2017) and the New York Declaration on Forests 
(Chazdon et al. 2017), and interventions undertaken for LDN and 
implementation of NDCs (see Glossary) can contribute to NET 
objectives. Such synergies may increase the financial resources 
available to meet multiple objectives (Section 4.8.4).
1.5.4 
Traditional biomass provision  
and land degradation
Traditional biomass (fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural residues, animal 
dung) used for cooking and heating by some  2.8  billion people 
(38% of global population) in non-OECD countries accounts for 
more than half of all bioenergy used worldwide (IEA 2017; REN21 
2018) (Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6). Cooking with traditional 
biomass has multiple negative impacts on human health, particularly 
for women, children and youth (Machisa et al. 2013; Sinha and Ray 
2015; Price 2017; Mendum and Njenga 2018; Adefuye et al. 2007) 
and on household productivity, including high workloads for women 
and youth (Mendum and Njenga 2018; Brunner et al. 2018; Hou et al. 
2018; Njenga et al. 2019). Traditional biomass is land-intensive due 
to reliance on open fires, inefficient stoves and overharvesting of 
woodfuel, contributing to land degradation, losses in biodiversity and 
reduced ecosystem services (IEA 2017; Bailis et al. 2015; Masera et al. 
2015; Specht et al. 2015; Fritsche et al. 2017; Fuso Nerini et al. 2017). 
Traditional woodfuels account for 1.9–2.3% of global GHG emissions, 
particularly in ‘hotspots’ of land degradation and fuelwood depletion 
in eastern Africa and South Asia, such that one-third of traditional 
woodfuels globally are harvested unsustainably (Bailis et al. 2015). 
Scenarios to significantly reduce reliance on traditional biomass in 
developing countries present multiple co-benefits (high evidence, 
high agreement), including reduced emissions of black carbon, 
a  short-lived climate forcer that also causes respiratory disease 
(Shindell et al. 2012). 
A shift from traditional to modern bioenergy, especially in the African 
context, contributes to improved livelihoods and can reduce land 
degradation and impacts on ecosystem services (Smeets et al. 2012; 
Gasparatos et al. 2018; Mudombi et al. 2018). In Sub-Saharan Africa, 
most countries mention woodfuel in their Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) but fail to identify transformational processes 
to make fuelwood a  sustainable energy source compatible with 
improved forest management (Amugune et al. 2017). In some regions, 
especially in South and Southeast Asia, a scarcity of woody biomass 
may lead to excessive removal and use of agricultural wastes and 
residues, which contributes to poor soil quality and land degradation 
(Blanco-Canqui and Lal 2009; Mateos et al. 2017).
In Sub-Saharan Africa, forest degradation is widely associated with 
charcoal production, although in some tropical areas rapid re-growth 
can offset forest losses (Hoffmann et al. 2017; McNicol et al. 2018). 
Overharvesting of wood for charcoal contributes to the high rate of 
deforestation in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is five times the world 
average, due in part to corruption and weak governance systems 
(Sulaiman et al. 2017). Charcoal may also be a by-product of forest 
clearing for agriculture, with charcoal sale providing immediate 
income when the land is cleared for food crops (Kiruki et al. 2017; 
Ndegwa et al. 2016). Besides loss of forest carbon stock, a further 
concern for climate change is methane and black carbon emissions 
from fuelwood burning and traditional charcoal-making processes 
(Bond et al. 2013; Patange et al. 2015; Sparrevik et al. 2015). 
A fundamental difficulty in reducing environmental impacts 
associated with charcoal lies in the small-scale nature of much 
charcoal production in Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to challenges in 
regulating its production and trade, which is often informal, and in 
some cases illegal, but nevertheless widespread since charcoal is the 
most important urban cooking fuel (Zulu 2010; Zulu and Richardson 
2013; Smith et al. 2015; World Bank 2009). Urbanisation combined 
with population growth has led to continuously increasing charcoal 
production. Low efficiency of traditional charcoal production results 
in a four-fold increase in raw woody biomass required and thus much 
greater biomass harvest (Hojas-Gascon et al. 2016; Smeets et al. 
2012). With continuing urbanisation anticipated, increased charcoal 
production and use will probably contribute to increasing land 
pressures and increased land degradation, especially in Sub-Saharan 
Africa (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Although it could be possible to source this biomass more 
sustainably, the ecosystem and health impacts of this increased 
demand for cooking fuel would be reduced through use of other 
renewable fuels or, in some cases, non-renewable fuels (LPG), as 
well as through improved efficiency in end-use and through better 
resource and supply chain management (Santos et al. 2017; Smeets 
et al. 2012; Hoffmann et al. 2017). Integrated response options such 
as agro-forestry (Chapter 6) and good governance mechanisms for 
forest and agricultural management (Chapter  7) can support the 
transition to sustainable energy for households and reduce the 
environmental impacts of traditional biomass.

Impacts of land degradation on climate
While Chapter  2  has its focus on land cover changes and their 
impacts on the climate system, this chapter focuses on the influences 
of individual land degradation processes on climate (see Table 4.1) 
which may or may not take place in association with land cover 
changes. The effects of land degradation on CO2 and other GHGs as 
well as those on surface albedo and other physical controls of the 
global radiative balance are discussed.

1.6.1 
Impact on greenhouse gases (GHGs)
Land degradation processes with direct impact on soil and 
terrestrial biota have great relevance in terms of CO2 exchange 
with the atmosphere, given the magnitude and activity of these 
reservoirs in the global carbon cycle. As the most widespread form 
of soil degradation, erosion detaches the surface soil material, 
which typically hosts the highest organic carbon stocks, favouring 
the mineralisation and release as CO2. Yet complementary processes 
such as carbon burial may compensate for this effect, making soil 
erosion a long-term carbon sink (low agreement, limited evidence), 
(Wang et al. (2017b), but see also Chappell et al. (2016)). Precise 
estimation of the CO2 released from eroded lands is challenged by 
the fact that only a fraction of the detached carbon is eventually lost 
to the atmosphere. It is important to acknowledge that a substantial 
fraction of the eroded material may preserve its organic carbon load 
in field conditions. Moreover, carbon sequestration may be favoured 
through the burial of both the deposited material and the surface 
of its hosting soil at the deposition location (Quinton et al. 2010). 
The cascading effects of erosion on other environmental processes 
at the affected sites can often cause net CO2 emissions through 
their indirect influence on soil fertility, and the balance of organic 
carbon inputs and outputs, interacting with other non-erosive soil 
degradation processes (such as nutrient depletion, compaction 
and salinisation), which can lead to the same net carbon effects 
(see Table 4.1) (van de Koppel et al. 1997). 
As natural and human-induced erosion can result in net carbon 
storage in very stable buried pools at the deposition locations, 
degradation in those locations has a high C-release potential. Coastal 
ecosystems such as mangrove forests, marshes and seagrasses are at 
typical deposition locations, and their degradation or replacement 
with other vegetation is resulting in a  substantial carbon release 
(0.15 to  1.02  GtC yr–1) (Pendleton et al. 2012), which highlights 
the need for a spatially integrated assessment of land degradation 
impacts on climate that considers in-situ but also ex-situ emissions. 
Cultivation and agricultural management of cultivated land are 
relevant in terms of global CO2 land–atmosphere exchange 
(Section 4.8.1). Besides the initial pulse of CO2 emissions associated 
with the onset of cultivation and associated vegetation clearing 
(Chapter  2), agricultural management practices can increase or 
reduce carbon losses to the atmosphere. Although global croplands 
are considered to be at a  relatively neutral stage in the current 
decade (Houghton et al. 2012), this results from a highly uncertain 
balance between coexisting net losses and gains. Degradation losses 
of soil and biomass carbon appear to be compensated by gains 
from soil protection and restoration practices such as cover crops, 
conservation tillage and nutrient replenishment favouring organic 
matter build-up. Cover crops, increasingly used to improve soils, 
have the potential to sequester 0.12 GtC yr–1 on global croplands 
with a saturation time of more than 150 years (Poeplau and Don 
2015). No-till practices (i.e., tillage elimination favouring crop residue 
retention in the soil surface) which were implemented to protect 
soils from erosion and reduce land preparation times, were also 
seen with optimism as a carbon sequestration option, which today 
is considered more modest globally and, in some systems, even less 
certain (VandenBygaart 2016; Cheesman et al. 2016; Powlson et al. 
2014). Among soil fertility restoration practices, lime application for 
acidity correction, increasingly important in tropical regions, can 
generate a significant net CO2 source in some soils (Bernoux et al. 
2003; Desalegn et al. 2017).
Land degradation processes in seminatural ecosystems driven by 
unsustainable uses of their vegetation through logging or grazing 
lead to reduced plant cover and biomass stocks, causing net carbon 
releases from soils and plant stocks. Degradation by logging activities 
is particularly prevalent in developing tropical and subtropical 
regions, involving carbon releases that exceed by far the biomass 
of harvested products, including additional vegetation and soil 
sources that are estimated to reach 0.6 GtC yr–1 (Pearson et al. 2014, 
2017). Excessive grazing pressures pose a more complex picture with 
variable magnitudes and even signs of carbon exchanges. A general 
trend of higher carbon losses in humid overgrazed rangelands 
suggests a  high potential for carbon sequestration following the 
rehabilitation of those systems (Conant and Paustian 2002) with 
a global potential sequestration of 0.045 GtC yr–1. A special case 
of degradation in rangelands is the process leading to the woody 
encroachment of grass-dominated systems, which can be responsible 
for declining animal production but high carbon sequestration rates 
(Asner et al. 2003; Maestre et al. 2009). 
Fire regime shifts in wild and seminatural ecosystems can become 
a  degradation process in itself, with high impact on net carbon 
emission and with underlying interactive human and natural drivers 
such as burning policies (Van Wilgen et al. 2004), biological invasions 
(Brooks et al. 2009), and plant pest/disease spread (Kulakowski et al. 
2003). Some of these interactive processes affecting unmanaged 
forests have resulted in massive carbon release, highlighting how 
degradation feedbacks on climate are not restricted to intensively 
used land but can affect wild ecosystems as well (Kurz et al. 2008). 
Agricultural land and wetlands represent the dominant source of 
non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs) (Chen et al. 2018d). In agricultural 
land, the expansion of rice cultivation (increasing CH4 sources), 
ruminant stocks and manure disposal (increasing CH4, N2O and NH3 
fluxes) and nitrogen over-fertilisation combined with soil acidification 
(increasing N2O fluxes) are introducing the major impacts (medium 
agreement, medium evidence) and their associated emissions appear 
to be exacerbated by global warming (medium agreement, medium 
evidence) (Oertel et al. 2016). 
As the major sources of global N2O emissions, over-fertilisation and 
manure disposal are not only increasing in-situ sources but also 
stimulating those along the pathway of dissolved inorganic nitrogen 
transport all the way from draining waters to the ocean (high 
agreement, medium evidence). Current budgets of anthropogenically 
fixed nitrogen on the Earth System (Tian et al. 2015; Schaefer et al. 
2016; Wang et al. 2017a) suggest that N2O release from terrestrial 
soils and wetlands accounts for 10–15% of the emissions, yet 
many further release fluxes along the hydrological pathway remain 
uncertain, with emissions from oceanic ‘dead-zones’ being a major 
aspect of concern (Schlesinger 2009; Rabalais et al. 2014).

Environmental degradation processes focused on the hydrological 
system, which are typically manifested at the landscape scale, 
include both drying (as in drained wetlands or lowlands) and wetting 
trends (as in waterlogged and flooded plains). Drying of wetlands 
reduces CH4 emissions (Turetsky et al. 2014) but favours pulses of 
organic matter mineralisation linked to high N2O release (Morse and 
Bernhardt 2013; Norton et al. 2011). The net warming balance of 
these two effects is not resolved and may be strongly variable across 
different types of wetlands. In the case of flooding of non-wetland 
soils, a suppression of CO2 release is typically overcompensated in 
terms of net greenhouse impact by enhanced CH4 fluxes that stem 
from the lack of aeration but are aided by the direct effect of extreme 
wetting on the solubilisation and transport of organic substrates 
(McNicol and Silver 2014). Both wetlands rewetting/restoration and 
artificial wetland creation can increase CH4 release (Altor and Mitsch 
2006; Fenner et al. 2011). Permafrost thawing is another major 
source of CH4 release, with substantial long-term contributions to the 
atmosphere that are starting to be globally quantified (Christensen 
et al. 2004; Schuur et al. 2015; Walter Anthony et al. 2016).
1.6.2 
Physical impacts
Among the physical effects of land degradation, surface albedo 
changes are those with the most evident impact on the net global 
radiative balance and net climate warming/cooling. Degradation 
processes affecting wild and semi-natural ecosystems, such as fire 
regime changes, woody encroachment, logging and overgrazing, can 
trigger strong albedo changes before significant biogeochemical shifts 
take place. In most cases these two types of effects have opposite 
signs in terms of net radiative forcing, making their joint assessment 
critical for understanding climate feedbacks (Bright et al. 2015).
In the case of forest degradation or deforestation, the albedo impacts 
are highly dependent on the latitudinal/climatic belt to which they 
belong. In boreal forests, the removal or degradation of the tree 
cover increases albedo (net cooling effect) (medium evidence, high 
agreement) as the reflective snow cover becomes exposed, which 
can exceed the net radiative effect of the associated carbon release 
to the atmosphere (Davin et al. 2010; Pinty et al. 2011). On the other 
hand, progressive greening of boreal and temperate forests has 
contributed to net albedo declines (medium agreement, medium 
evidence) (Planque et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018a). In the northern 
treeless vegetation belt (tundra), shrub encroachment leads to the 
opposite effect as the emergence of plant structures above the snow 
cover level reduce winter-time albedo (Sturm 2005). 
The extent to which albedo shifts can compensate for carbon storage 
shifts at the global level has not been estimated. A significant but 
partial compensation takes place in temperate and subtropical dry 
ecosystems in which radiation levels are higher and carbon stocks 
smaller compared to their more humid counterparts (medium 
agreement, medium evidence). In cleared dry woodlands, half of the 
net global warming effect of net carbon release has been compensated 
by albedo increase (Houspanossian et al. 2013), whereas in afforested 
dry rangelands, albedo declines cancelled one-fifth of the net carbon 
sequestration (Rotenberg and Yakir 2010). Other important cases 
in which albedo effects impose a  partial compensation of carbon 
exchanges are the vegetation shifts associated with wildfires, as 
shown for the savannahs, shrublands and grasslands of Sub-Saharan 
Africa (Dintwe et al. 2017). Besides the net global effects discussed 
above, albedo shifts can play a significant role in local climate (high 
agreement, medium evidence), as exemplified by the effect of no-till 
agriculture reducing local heat extremes in European landscapes 
(Davin et al. 2014) and the effects of woody encroachment causing 
precipitation rises in the North American Great Plains (Ge and Zou 
2013). Modelling efforts that integrate ground data from deforested 
areas worldwide accounting for both physical and biogeochemical 
effects, indicate that massive global deforestation would have 
a net warming impact (Lawrence and Vandecar 2015) at both local 
and global levels with highlight non-linear effects of forest loss on 
climate variables. 
Beyond the albedo effects presented above, other physical impacts 
of land degradation on the atmosphere can contribute to global 
and regional climate change. Of particular relevance, globally and 
continentally, are the net cooling effects of dust emissions (low 
agreement, medium evidence) (Lau and Kim (2007), but see also 
Huang et al. (2014)). Anthropogenic emission of mineral particles 
from degrading land appear to have a similar radiative impact than 
all other anthropogenic aerosols (Sokolik and Toon 1996). Dust 
emissions may explain regional climate anomalies through reinforcing 
feedbacks, as suggested for the amplification of the intensity, extent 
and duration of the low precipitation anomaly of the North American 
Dust Bowl in the 1930s (Cook et al. 2009). Another source of physical 
effects on climate are surface roughness changes which, by affecting 
atmospheric drag, can alter cloud formation and precipitation 
(low agreement, low evidence), as suggested by modelling studies 
showing how the massive deployment of solar panels in the Sahara 
could increase rainfall in the Sahel (Li et al. 2018c), or how woody 
encroachment in the Arctic tundra could reduce cloudiness and 
raise temperature (Cho et al. 2018). The complex physical effects of 
deforestation, as explored through modelling, converge into general 
net regional precipitation declines, tropical temperature increases 
and boreal temperature declines, while net global effects are less 
certain (Perugini et al. 2017). Integrating all the physical effects of 
land degradation and its recovery or reversal is still a  challenge, 
yet modelling attempts suggest that, over the last three decades, 
the slow but persistent net global greening caused by the average 
increase of leaf area in the land has caused a net cooling of the 
Earth, mainly through the rise in evapotranspiration (Zeng et al. 
2017) (low confidence).
1.7 
Impacts of climate-related land 
degradation on poverty and livelihoods 
Unravelling the impacts of climate-related land degradation on 
poverty and livelihoods is highly challenging. This complexity is due 
to the interplay of multiple social, political, cultural and economic 
factors, such as markets, technology, inequality, population growth, 
(Barbier and Hochard 2018) each of which interact and shape the 
ways in which social-ecological systems respond (Morton 2007). 
We find limited evidence attributing the impacts of climate-related

land degradation to poverty and livelihoods, with climate often not 
distinguished from any other driver of land degradation. Climate 
is nevertheless frequently noted as a risk multiplier for both land 
degradation and poverty (high agreement, robust evidence) and is 
one of many stressors people live with, respond to and adapt to in 
their daily lives (Reid and Vogel 2006). Climate change is considered to 
exacerbate land degradation and potentially accelerate it due to heat 
stress, drought, changes to evapotranspiration rates and biodiversity, 
as well as a  result of changes to environmental conditions that 
allow new pests and diseases to thrive (Reed and Stringer 2016). In 
general terms, the climate (and climate change) can increase human 
and ecological communities’ sensitivity to land degradation. Land 
degradation then leaves livelihoods more sensitive to the impacts 
of climate change and extreme climatic events (high agreement, 
robust evidence). If human and ecological communities exposed to 
climate change and land degradation are sensitive and cannot adapt, 
they can be considered vulnerable to it; if they are sensitive and can 
adapt, they can be considered resilient (Reed and Stringer 2016). The 
impacts of land degradation will vary under a changing climate, both 
spatially and temporally, leading some communities and ecosystems 
to be more vulnerable or more resilient than others under different 
scenarios. Even within communities, groups such as women and 
youth are often more vulnerable than others. 
1.7.1 
Relationships between land degradation, 
climate change and poverty 
This section sets out the relationships between land degradation and 
poverty, and climate change and poverty, leading to inferences about 
the three-way links between them. Poverty is multidimensional and 
includes a lack of access to the whole range of capital assets that can 
be used to pursue a livelihood. Livelihoods constitute the capabilities, 
assets and activities that are necessary to make a living (Chambers 
and Conway 1992; Olsson et al. 2014b). 
The literature shows high agreement in terms of speculation that 
there are potential links between land degradation and poverty. 
However, studies have not provided robust quantitative assessments 
of the extent and incidence of poverty within populations affected by 
land degradation (Barbier and Hochard 2016). Some researchers, for 
example, Nachtergaele et al. (2011) estimate that 1.5 billion people 
were dependent upon degraded land to support their livelihoods in 
2007, while >42% of the world’s poor population inhabit degraded 
areas. However, there is overall low confidence in the evidence base, 
a lack of studies that look beyond the past and present, and the 
literature calls for more in-depth research to be undertaken on these 
issues (Gerber et al. 2014). Recent work by Barbier and Hochard 
(2018) points to biophysical constraints such as poor soils and 
limited rainfall, which interact to limit land productivity, suggesting 
that those farming in climatically less-favourable agricultural areas 
are challenged by poverty. Studies such as those by Coomes et al. 
(2011), focusing on an area in the Amazon, highlight the importance 
of the initial conditions of land holding in the dominant (shifting) 
cultivation system in terms of long-term effects on household 
poverty and future forest cover, showing that initial land tenure and 
socio-economic aspects can make some areas less favourable too. 
Much of the qualitative literature is focused on understanding the 
livelihood and poverty impacts of degradation through a focus on 
subsistence agriculture, where farms are small, under traditional or 
informal tenure and where exposure to environmental (including 
climate) risks is high (Morton 2007). In these situations, poorer people 
lack access to assets (financial, social, human, natural and physical) 
and in the absence of appropriate institutional supports and social 
protection, this leaves them sensitive and unable to adapt, so a vicious 
cycle of poverty and degradation can ensue. To further illustrate the 
complexity, livelihood assessments often focus on a single snapshot 
in time. Livelihoods are dynamic and people alter their livelihood 
activities and strategies depending on the internal and external 
stressors to which they are responding (O’Brien et al. 2004). When 
certain livelihood activities and strategies are no longer tenable as 
a result of land degradation (and may push people into poverty), land 
degradation can have further effects on issues such as migration (Lee 
2009), as people adapt by moving (Section 4.7.3); and may result in 
conflict (Section 4.7.3), as different groups within society compete 
for scarce resources, sometimes through non-peaceful actions. Both 
migration and conflict can lead to land-use changes elsewhere that 
further fuel climate change through increased emissions. 
Similar challenges as for understanding land degradation–poverty 
linkages are experienced in unravelling the relationship between 
climate change and poverty. A particular issue in examining climate 
change–poverty links relates to the common use of aggregate 
economic statistics like GDP, as the assets and income of the 
poor constitute a minor proportion of national wealth (Hallegatte 
et al. 2018). Aggregate quantitative measures also fail to capture the 
distributions of costs and benefits from climate change. Furthermore, 
people fall into and out of poverty, with climate change being one 
of many factors affecting these dynamics, through its impacts on 
livelihoods. Much of the literature on climate change and poverty 
tends to look backward rather than forward (Skoufias et al. 2011), 
providing a snapshot of current or past relationships (for example, 
Dell et al. (2009) who examine the relationship between temperature 
and income (GDP) using cross-sectional data from countries in the 
Americas). Yet, simulations of future climate change impacts on 
income or poverty are largely lacking. 
Noting the limited evidence that exists that explicitly focuses on the 
relationship between land degradation, climate change and poverty, 
Barbier and Hochard (2018b) suggest that those people living in 
less-favoured agricultural areas face a  poverty–environment trap 
that can result in increased land degradation under climate change 
conditions. The emergent relationships between land degradation, 
climate change and poverty are shown in Figure  4.6 (see also 
Figure 6.1).
The poor have access to few productive assets – so land, and the 
natural resource base more widely, plays a key role in supporting the 
livelihoods of the poor. It is, however, hard to make generalisations 
about how important income derived from the natural resource 
base is for rural livelihoods in the developing world (Angelsen 
et al. 2014). Studies focusing on forest resources have shown that 
approximately one quarter of the total rural household income in 
developing countries stems from forests, with forest-based income 
379

shares being tentatively higher for low-income households (Vedeld 
et al. 2007; Angelsen et al. 2014). Different groups use land in different 
ways within their overall livelihood portfolios and are, therefore, at 
different levels of exposure and sensitivity to climate shocks and 
stresses. The literature nevertheless displays high evidence and 
high agreement that those populations whose livelihoods are more 
sensitive to climate change and land degradation are often more 
dependent on environmental assets, and these people are often the 
poorest members of society. There is further high evidence and high 
agreement that both climate change and land degradation can affect 
livelihoods and poverty through their threat multiplier effect. Research 
in Bellona, in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific (Reenberg 
et al. 2008) examined event-driven impacts on livelihoods, taking into 
account weather events as one of many drivers of land degradation 
and links to broader land use and land cover changes that have taken 
place. Geographical locations experiencing land degradation are often 
the same locations that are directly affected by poverty, and also by 
extreme events linked to climate change and variability. 
Much of the assessment presented above has considered 
place-based analyses examining the relationships between poverty, 
land degradation and climate change in the locations in which these 
outcomes have occurred. Altieri and Nicholls (2017) note that, due 
to the globalised nature of markets and consumption systems, the 
impacts of changes in crop yields linked to climate-related land 
degradation (manifest as lower yields) will be far reaching, beyond 
the sites and livelihoods experiencing degradation. Despite these 
teleconnections, farmers living in poverty in developing countries will 
be especially vulnerable due to their exposure, dependence on the 
environment for income and limited options to engage in other ways 
to make a living (Rosenzweig and Hillel 1998). In identifying ways in 
which these interlinkages can be addressed, Scherr (2000) observes 
that key actions that can jointly address poverty and environmental 
improvement often seek to increase access to natural resources, 
enhance the productivity of the natural resource assets of the poor, 
and engage stakeholders in addressing public natural resource 
management issues. In this regard, it is increasingly recognised that 
those suffering from, and being vulnerable to, land degradation and 
poverty need to have a voice and play a role in the development 
of solutions, especially where the natural resources and livelihood 
activities they depend on are further threatened by climate change. 
1.7.2 
Impacts of climate-related land degradation 
on food security
How and where we grow food, compared to where and when we need 
to consume it, is at the crux of issues surrounding land degradation, 
climate change and food security, especially because more than 
75% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) faces rain-fed 
crop production constraints (Fischer et al. 2009), see also Chapter 5. 
Taken separately, knowledge on land degradation processes and 
human-induced climate change has attained a great level of maturity. 
However, their combined effects on food security, notably food supply, 
remain underappreciated (Webb et al. 2017b), and quantitative 
information is lacking. Just a  few studies have shown how the 
interactive effects of the aforementioned challenging, interrelated 
phenomena can impact on crop productivity and hence food security 
and quality (Karami et al. 2009; Allen et al. 2001; Högy and Fangmeier 
2008) (low evidence). Along with socio-economic drivers, climate 
change accelerates land degradation due to its influence on land-use 
systems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005; UNCCD 2017), 
potentially leading to a  decline in agri-food system productivity, 
particularly on the supply side. Increases in temperature and changes 
in precipitation patterns are expected to have impacts on soil quality, 
including nutrient availability and assimilation (St.Clair and Lynch 
2010). Those climate-related changes are expected to have net 
negative impacts on agricultural productivity, particularly in tropical 
regions, though the magnitude of impacts depends on the models 
used. Anticipated supply-side issues linked to land and climate relate 
to biocapacity factors (including e.g., whether there is enough water 
to support agriculture); production factors (e.g., chemical pollution 
of soil and water resources or lack of soil nutrients) and distribution 
issues (e.g., decreased availability of and/or accessibility to the 
necessary diversity of quality food where and when it is needed) 
(Stringer et al. 2011). Climate-sensitive transport infrastructure is

also problematic for food security (Islam et al. 2017), and can lead to 
increased food waste, while poor siting of roads and transport links 
can lead to soil erosion and forest loss (Xiao et al. 2017), further 
feeding back into climate change. 
Over the past decades, crop models have been useful tools for 
assessing and understanding climate change impacts on crop 
productivity and food security (White et al. 2011; Rosenzweig et al. 
2014). Yet, the interactive effects of soil parameters and climate 
change on crop yields and food security remain limited, with low 
evidence of how they play out in different economic and climate 
settings (e.g., Sundström et al. 2014). Similarly, there have been few 
meta-analyses focusing on the adaptive capacity of land-use practices 
such as conservation agriculture in light of climate stress (see e.g., 
Steward et al. 2018), as well as low evidence quantifying the role 
of wild foods and forests (and, by extension, forest degradation) in 
both the global food basket and in supporting household-scale food 
security (Bharucha and Pretty 2010; Hickey et al. 2016).
To be sustainable, any initiative aimed at addressing food 
security – encompassing supply, diversity and quality – must take 
into consideration the interactive effects between climate and 
land degradation in a  context of other socio-economic stressors. 
Such socio-economic factors are especially important if we look at 
demand-side issues too, which include lack of purchasing power, 
large-scale speculation on global food markets, leading to exponential 
price rises (Tadesse et al. 2014), competition in appropriation of 
supplies and changes to per capita food consumption (Stringer 
et al. 2011) (Chapter  5). Lack of food security, combined with 
lack of livelihood options, is often an important manifestation of 
vulnerability, and can act as a key trigger for people to migrate. In 
this way, migration becomes an adaptation strategy. 
1.7.3 
Impacts of climate-related land degradation  
on migration and conflict
Land degradation may trigger competition for scarce natural resources, 
potentially leading to migration and/or conflict, though, even with 
medium evidence, there is low agreement in the literature. Linkages 
between land degradation and migration occur within a larger context 
of multi-scale interaction of environmental and non-environmental 
drivers and processes, including resettlement projects, searches 
for education and/or income, land shortages, political turmoil, and 
family-related reasons (McLeman 2017; Hermans and Ide 2019). 
The complex contribution of climate to migration and conflict 
hampers retrieving any level of confidence on climate-migration and 
climate-conflict linkages, therefore constituting a major knowledge 
gap (Cramer et al. 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018). 
There is low evidence on the causal linkages between climate change, 
land degradation processes (other than desertification) and migration. 
Existing studies on land degradation and migration  – particularly 
in drylands – largely focus on the effect of rainfall variability and 
drought, and show how migration serves as adaptation strategy 
(Piguet et al. 2018; McLeman 2017; Chapter 3). For example, in the 
Ethiopian highlands, severe topsoil erosion and forest degradation 
is a  major environmental stressor which is amplified by recurring 
droughts, with migration being an important household adaptation 
strategy (Morrissey 2013). In the humid tropics, land degradation, 
mainly as a  consequence of deforestation, has been a  reported 
reason for people leaving their homes during the Amazonian 
colonisation (Hecht 1983) but was also observed more recently, for 
example in Guatemala, where soil degradation was one of the most 
frequently cited migration pushes (López-Carr 2012) and Kenya, 
where households respond to low soil quality by sending temporary 
migrants for additional income generation (Gray 2011). In contrast, 
in the Andean highlands and the Pacific coastal plain, migration 
increased with land quality, probably because revenues from 
additional agricultural production was invested in costly forms of 
migration (Gray and Bilsborrow 2013). These mixed results illustrate 
the complex, non-linear relationship of land degradation–migration 
linkages and suggest that explaining land degradationand migration 
linkages requires considering a  broad range of socio-ecological 
conditions (McLeman 2017).
In addition to people moving away from an area due to ‘lost’ 
livelihood activities, climate-related land degradation can also reduce 
the availability of livelihood safety nets – environmental assets that 
people use during times of shocks or stress. For example, Barbier (2000) 
notes that wetlands in north-east Nigeria around Hadejia–Jama’are 
floodplain provide dry season pastures for seminomadic herders, 
agricultural surpluses for Kano and Borno states, groundwater 
recharge of the Chad formation aquifer and ‘insurance’ resources in 
times of drought. The floodplain also supports many migratory bird 
species. As climate change and land degradation combine, delivery of 
these multiple services can be undermined, particularly as droughts 
become more widespread, reducing the utility of this wetland 
environment as a safety net for people and wildlife alike.
Early studies conducted in Africa hint at a  significant causal link 
between land degradation and violent conflict (Homer-Dixon et al. 
1993). For example, Percival and Homer-Dixon (1995) identified land 
degradation as one of the drivers of the crisis in Rwanda in the early 
1990s, which allowed radical forces to stoke ethnic rivalries. With 
respect to the Darfur conflict, some scholars and United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP) concluded that land degradation, 
together with other environmental stressors, constitute a  major 
security threat for the Sudanese people (Byers and Dragojlovic 2004; 
Sachs 2007; UNEP 2007). Recent studies show low agreement, 
suggesting that climate change can increase the likelihood of civil 
violence if certain economic, political and social factors, including 
low development and weak governance mechanisms, are present 
(Scheffran et al. 2012; Benjaminsen et al. 2012). In contrast, Raleigh 
and Urdal (2007) found in a global study that land degradation is 
a  weak predictor for armed conflict. As such, studies addressing 
possible linkages between climate change  – a  key driver of land 
degradation – and the risks of conflict have yielded contradictory 
results, and it remains largely unclear whether land degradation 
resulting from climate change leads to conflict or cooperation 
(Salehyan 2008; Solomon et al. 2018).
Land degradation–conflict linkages can be bi-directional. Research 
suggests that households experiencing natural resource degradation 
381

often engage in migration for securing livelihoods (Kreamer 2012), 
which potentially triggers land degradation at the destination, 
leading to conflict there (Kassa et al. 2017). While this indeed holds 
true for some cases, it may not for others, given the complexity of 
processes, contexts and drivers. Where conflict and violence do 
ensue, it is often as a result of a lack of appreciation for the cultural 
practices of others. 
1.8 
Addressing land degradation  
in the context of climate change 
Land degradation in the form of soil carbon loss is estimated to have 
been ongoing for at least 12,000 years, but increased exponentially 
in the last 200 years (Sanderman et al. 2017). Before the advent of 
modern sources of nutrients, it was imperative for farmers to maintain 
and improve soil fertility through the prevention of runoff and 
erosion, and management of nutrients through vegetation residues 
and manure. Many ancient farming systems were sustainable for 
hundreds and even thousands of years, such as raised-field agriculture 
in Mexico (Crews and Gliessman 1991), tropical forest gardens in 
Southeast Asia and Central America (Ross 2011; Torquebiau 1992; 
Turner and Sabloff 2012), terraced agriculture in East Africa, Central 
America, Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean basin (Turner and 
Sabloff 2012; Preti and Romano 2014; Widgren and Sutton 2004; 
Håkansson and Widgren 2007; Davies and Moore 2016; Davies 
2015), and integrated rice–fish cultivation in East Asia (Frei and 
Becker 2005). 
Such long-term sustainable farming systems evolved in very different 
times and geographical contexts, but they share many common 
features, such as: the combination of species and structural diversity 
in time and space (horizontally and vertically) in order to optimise 
the use of available land; recycling of nutrients through biodiversity 
of plants, animals and microbes; harnessing the full range of 
site-specific micro-environments (e.g., wet and dry soils); biological 
interdependencies which help suppression of pests; reliance on 
mainly local resources; reliance on local varieties of crops, and 
sometimes incorporation of wild plants and animals; the systems are 
often labour and knowledge intensive (Rudel et al. 2016; Beets 1990; 
Netting 1993; Altieri and Koohafkan 2008). Such farming systems 
have stood the test of time and can provide important knowledge 
for adapting farming systems to climate change (Koohafkann and 
Altieri 2011). 
In modern agriculture, the importance of maintaining the biological 
productivity and ecological integrity of farmland has not been 
a necessity in the same way as in pre-modern agriculture because 
nutrients and water have been supplied externally. The extreme 
land degradation in the US Midwest during the Dust Bowl period 
in the 1930s became an important wake-up call for agriculture and 
agricultural research and development, from which we can still 
learn much in order to adapt to ongoing and future climate change 
(McLeman et al. 2014; Baveye et al. 2011; McLeman and Smit 2006). 
SLM is a unifying framework for addressing land degradation and can 
be defined as the stewardship and use of land resources, including 
soils, water, animals and plants, to meet changing human needs, 
while simultaneously ensuring the long-term productive potential 
of these resources and the maintenance of their environmental 
functions. It is a comprehensive approach comprising technologies 
combined with social, economic and political enabling conditions 
(Nkonya et al. 2011). It is important to stress that farming systems 
are informed by both scientific and local/traditional knowledge. The 
power of SLM in small-scale diverse farming was demonstrated 
effectively in Nicaragua after the severe cyclone Mitch in 1998 
(Holt-Giménez 2002). Pairwise analysis of 880 fields with and 
without implementation of SLM practices showed that the SLM fields 
systematically fared better than the fields without SLM in terms of 
more topsoil remaining, higher field moisture, more vegetation, less 
erosion and lower economic losses after the cyclone. Furthermore, 
the difference between fields with and without SLM increased with 
increasing levels of storm intensity, slope gradient, and age of SLM 
(Holt-Giménez 2002). 
When addressing land degradation through SLM and other approaches, 
it is important to consider feedbacks that impact on climate change. 
Table  4.2 shows some of the most important land degradation 
issues, their potential solutions, and their impacts on climate change. 
This table provides a link between the comprehensive lists of land 
degradation processes (Table 4.1) and land management solutions. 
1.8.1 
Actions on the ground to address 
land degradation
Concrete actions on the ground to address land degradation are 
primarily focused on soil and water conservation. In the context of 
adaptation to climate change, actions relevant for addressing land 
degradation are sometimes framed as ecosystem-based adaptation 
(Scarano 2017) or Nature-Based Solutions (Nesshöver et al. 2017), 
and in an agricultural context, agroecology (see Glossary) provides 
an important frame. The site-specific biophysical and social 
conditions, including local and indigenous knowledge, are important 
for successful implementation of concrete actions. 
Responses to land degradation generally take the form of agronomic 
measures (methods related to managing the vegetation cover), 
soil management (methods related to tillage, nutrient supply), and 
mechanical methods (methods resulting in durable changes to the 
landscape) (Morgan 2005a). Measures may be combined to reinforce 
benefits to land quality, as well as improving carbon sequestration 
that supports climate change mitigation. Some measures offer 
adaptation options and other co-benefits, such as agroforestry, 
involving planting fruit trees that can support food security in the face 
of climate change impacts (Reed and Stringer 2016), or application 
of compost or biochar that enhances soil water-holding capacity, so 
increases resilience to drought.
There are important differences in terms of labour and capital 
requirements for different technologies, and also implications for land 
tenure arrangements. Agronomic measures and soil management 
require generally little extra capital input and comprise activities 
repeated annually, so have no particular implication for land tenure 
382

arrangements. Mechanical methods require substantial upfront 
investments in terms of capital and labour, resulting in long-lasting 
structural change, requiring more secure land tenure arrangements 
(Mekuriaw et al. 2018). Agroforestry is a  particularly important 
strategy for SLM in the context of climate change because of the 
large potential to sequester carbon in plants and soil and enhance 
resilience of agricultural systems (Zomer et al. 2016).
Implementation of SLM practices has been shown to increase 
the productivity of land (Branca et al. 2013) and to provide good 
economic returns on investment in many different settings around the 
world (Mirzabaev et al. 2015). Giger et al. (2018) showed, in a meta 
study of 363 SLM projects over the period 1990 to 2012, that 73% 
of the projects were perceived to have a positive or at least neutral 
cost-benefit ratio in the short term, and 97% were perceived to have 
a positive or very positive cost-benefit ratio in the long term (robust 
evidence, high agreement). Despite the positive effects, uptake is far 
from universal. Local factors, both biophysical conditions (e.g., soils, 
drainage, and topography) and socio-economic conditions (e.g., land 
tenure, economic status, and land fragmentation) play decisive roles in 
the interest in, capacity to undertake, and successful implementation of 
SLM practices (Teshome et al. 2016; Vogl et al. 2017; Tesfaye et al. 2016; 
Cerdà et al. 2018; Adimassu et al. 2016). From a landscape perspective, 
SLM can generate benefits, including adaptation to and mitigation of 
climate change, for entire watersheds, but challenges remain regarding 
coordinated and consistent implementation (medium evidence, 
medium agreement) (Kerr et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016a). 
1.8.1.1 
Agronomic and soil management measures
Rebuilding soil carbon is an important goal of SLM, particularly in the 
context of climate change (Rumpel et al. 2018). The two most important 
reasons why agricultural soils have lost 20–60% of the soil carbon 
they contained under natural ecosystem conditions are the frequent 
disturbance through tillage and harvesting, and the change from deep-
rooted perennial plants to shallow-rooted annual plants (Crews and 
Table 4.2 |   Interaction of human and climate drivers can exacerbate desertification and land degradation. Climate change exacerbates the rate and magnitude 
of several ongoing land degradation and desertification processes. Human drivers of land degradation and desertification include expanding agriculture, agricultural 
practices and forest management. In turn, land degradation and desertification are also drivers of climate change through GHG emissions, reduced rates of carbon 
uptake, and reduced capacity of ecosystems to act as carbon sinks into the future. Impacts on climate change are either warming (in red) or cooling (in blue).

Rumsey 2017). Practices that build soil carbon are those that increase 
organic matter input to soil, or reduce decomposition of SOM.
Agronomic practices can alter the carbon balance significantly, by 
increasing organic inputs from litter and roots into the soil. Practices 
include retention of residues, use of locally adapted varieties, 
inter-cropping, crop rotations, and green manure crops that replace 
the bare field fallow during winter and are eventually ploughed before 
sowing the next main crop (Henry et al. 2018). Cover crops (green 
manure crops and catch crops that are grown between the main 
cropping seasons) can increase soil carbon stock by between  0.22 
and 0.4 t C ha–1yr–1 (Poeplau and Don 2015; Kaye and Quemada 2017). 
Reduced tillage (or no-tillage) is an important strategy for reducing 
soil erosion and nutrient loss by wind and water (Van Pelt et al. 2017; 
Panagos et al. 2015; Borrelli et al. 2016). But the evidence that no-till 
agriculture also sequesters carbon is not compelling (VandenBygaart 
2016). Soil sampling of only the upper 30 cm can give biased results, 
suggesting that soils under no-till practices have higher carbon 
content than soils under conventional tillage (Baker et al. 2007; Ogle 
et al. 2012; Fargione et al. 2018; VandenBygaart 2016). 
Changing from annual to perennial crops can increase soil carbon 
content (Culman et al. 2013; Sainju et al. 2017). A perennial grain 
crop (intermediate wheatgrass) was, on average, over four years 
a net carbon sink of about 13.5 tCO2 ha–1 yr–1 (de Oliveira et al. 2018). 
Sprunger et al. (2018) compared an annual winter wheat crop with 
a perennial grain crop (intermediate wheatgrass) and found that the 
perennial grain root biomass was 15 times larger than winter wheat, 
however, there was no significant difference in soil carbon pools after 
the four-year experiment. Exactly how much, and over what time 
period, carbon can be sequestered through changing from annual to 
perennial crops depends on the degree of soil carbon depletion and 
other local biophysical factors (Section 4.9.2).
Integrated soil fertility management is a  sustainable approach to 
nutrient management that uses a  combination of chemical and 
organic amendments (manure, compost, biosolids, biochar), rhizobial 
nitrogen fixation, and liming materials to address soil chemical 
constraints (Henry et al. 2018). In pasture systems, management 
of grazing pressure, fertilisation, diverse species including legumes 
and perennial grasses can reduce erosion and enhance soil carbon 
(Conant et al. 2017).
1.8.1.2 
Mechanical soil and water conservation
In hilly and mountainous terrain, terracing is an ancient but still 
practised soil conservation method worldwide (Preti and Romano 
2014) in climatic zones from arid to humid tropics (Balbo 2017). 
By reducing the slope gradient of hillsides, terraces provide flat 
surfaces. Deep, loose soils that increase infiltration, reduce erosion 
and thus sediment transport. They also decrease the hydrological 
connectivity and thus reduce hillside runoff (Preti et al. 2018; Wei 
et al. 2016; Arnáez et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2017). In terms of climate 
change, terraces are a form of adaptation that helps in cases where 
rainfall is increasing or intensifying (by reducing slope gradient and 
the hydrological connectivity), and where rainfall is decreasing (by 
increasing infiltration and reducing runoff) (robust evidence, high 
agreement). There are several challenges, however, to continued 
maintenance and construction of new terraces, such as the high costs 
in terms of labour and/or capital (Arnáez et al. 2015) and disappearing 
local knowledge for maintaining and constructing new terraces (Chen 
et al. 2017). The propensity of farmers to invest in mechanical soil 
conservation methods varies with land tenure; farmers with secure 
tenure arrangements are more willing to invest in durable practices 
such as terraces (Lovo 2016; Sklenicka et al. 2015; Haregeweyn et al. 
2015). Where the slope is less severe, erosion can be controlled by 
contour banks, and the keyline approach (Duncan 2016; Stevens et al. 
2015) to soil and water conservation.
1.8.1.3 
Agroforestry 
Agroforestry is defined as a collective name for land-use systems in 
which woody perennials (trees, shrubs, etc.) are grown in association 
with herbaceous plants (crops, pastures) and/or livestock in a spatial 
arrangement, a  rotation, or both, and in which there are both 
ecological and economic interactions between the tree and non-tree 
components of the system (Young, 1995, p. 11). At least since the 1980s, 
agroforestry has been widely touted as an ideal land management 
practice in areas vulnerable to climate variations and subject to soil 
erosion. Agroforestry holds the promise of improving soil and climatic 
conditions, while generating income from wood energy, timber and 
non-timber products – sometimes presented as a synergy of adaptation 
and mitigation of climate change (Mbow et al. 2014). 
There is strong scientific consensus that a combination of forestry with 
agricultural crops and/or livestock, agroforestry systems can provide 
additional ecosystem services when compared with monoculture crop 
systems (Waldron et al. 2017; Sonwa et al. 2011, 2014, 2017; Charles 
et al. 2013). Agroforestry can enable sustainable intensification by 
allowing continuous production on the same unit of land with higher 
productivity without the need to use shifting agriculture systems to 
maintain crop yields (Nath et al. 2016). This is especially relevant 
where there is a regional requirement to find a balance between the 
demand for increased agricultural production and the protection of 
adjacent natural ecosystems such as primary and secondary forests 
(Mbow et al. 2014). For example, the use of agroforestry for perennial 
crops such as coffee and cocoa is increasingly promoted as offering 
a  route to sustainable farming, with important climate change 
adaptation and mitigation co-benefits (Sonwa et al. 2001; Kroeger 
et al. 2017). Reported co-benefits of agroforestry in cocoa production 
include increased carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, improved 
water and nutrient use efficiency and the creation of a favourable 
micro-climate for crop production (Sonwa et al. 2017; Chia et al. 
2016). Importantly, the maintenance of soil fertility using agroforestry 
has the potential to reduce the practice of shifting agriculture 
(of cocoa) which results in deforestation (Gockowski and Sonwa 
2011). However, positive interactions within these systems can be 
ecosystem and/or species specific, but co-benefits such as increased 
resilience to extreme climate events, or improved soil fertility are 
not always observed (Blaser et al. 2017; Abdulai et al. 2018). These 
contrasting outcomes indicate the importance of field-scale research 
programmes to inform agroforestry system design, species selection 
and management practices (Sonwa et al. 2014).

Despite the many proven benefits, adoption of agroforestry has been 
low and slow (Toth et al. 2017; Pattanayak et al. 2003; Jerneck and 
Olsson 2014). There are several reasons for the slow uptake, but the 
perception of risks and the time lag between adoption and realisation 
of benefits are often important (Pattanayak et al. 2003; Mercer 2004; 
Jerneck and Olsson 2013).
An important question for agroforestry is whether it supports poverty 
alleviation, or if it favours comparatively affluent households. 
Experiences from India suggest that the overall adoption is low, 
with a differential between rich and poor households. Brockington 
el al. (2016), studied agroforestry adoption over many years in South 
India and found that, overall, only 18% of the households adopted 
agroforestry. However, among the relatively rich households who 
adopted agroforestry, 97% were still practising it after six to eight 
years, and some had expanded their operations. Similar results were 
obtained in Western Kenya, where food-secure households were much 
more willing to adopt agroforestry than food-insecure households 
(Jerneck and Olsson 2013, 2014). Other experiences from Sub-Saharan 
Africa illustrate the difficulties (such as local institutional support) 
of having a continued engagement of communities in agroforestry 
(Noordin et al. 2001; Matata et al. 2013; Meijer et al. 2015).
1.8.1.4 
Crop–livestock interaction as an approach 
to managing land degradation 
The integration of crop and livestock production into ‘mixed farming’ 
for smallholders in developing countries became an influential 
model, particularly for Africa, in the early 1990s (Pritchard et al. 1992; 
McIntire et al. 1992). Crop–livestock integration under this model 
was seen as founded on three pillars: improved use of manure for 
crop fertility management; expanded use of animal traction (draught 
animals); and promotion of cultivated fodder crops. For Asia, emphasis 
was placed on draught power for land preparation, manure for soil 
fertility enhancement, and fodder production as an entry point for 
cultivation of legumes (Devendra and Thomas 2002). Mixed farming 
was seen as an evolutionary process to expand food production in the 
face of population increase, promote improvements in income and 
welfare, and protect the environment. The process could be further 
facilitated and steered by research, agricultural advisory services and 
policy (Pritchard et al. 1992; McIntire et al. 1992; Devendra 2002).
Scoones and Wolmer (2002) place this model in historical context, 
including concern about population pressure on resources and the 
view that mobile pastoralism was environmentally damaging. The 
latter view had already been critiqued by developing understandings 
of pastoralism, mobility and communal tenure of grazing lands 
(e.g.,  Behnke 1994; Ellis 1994). They set out a  much more 
differentiated picture of crop–livestock interactions, which can take 
place either within a single-farm household, or between crop and 
livestock producers, in which case they will be mediated by formal 
and informal institutions governing the allocation of land, labour and 
capital, with the interactions evolving through multiple place-specific 
pathways (Ramisch et al. 2002; Scoones and Wolmer 2002). 
Promoting a diversity of approaches to crop–livestock interactions 
does not imply that the integrated model necessarily leads to land 
degradation, but increases the space for institutional support to local 
innovation (Scoones and Wolmer 2002).
However, specific managerial and technological practices that link 
crop and livestock production will remain an important part of 
the repertoire of on-farm adaptation and mitigation. Howden and 
coauthors (Howden et al. 2007) note the importance of innovation 
within existing integrated systems, including use of adapted forage 
crops. Rivera-Ferre et al. (2016) list as adaptation strategies with high 
potential for grazing systems, mixed crop–livestock systems or both: 
crop–livestock integration in general; soil management, including 
composting; enclosure and corralling of animals; improved storage 
of feed. Most of these are seen as having significant co-benefits 
for mitigation, and improved management of manure is seen as 
a mitigation measure with adaptation co-benefits.
1.8.2 
Local and indigenous knowledge for addressing 
land degradation
In practice, responses are anchored in scientific research, as well 
as local, indigenous and traditional knowledge and know-how. 
For example, studies in the Philippines by Camacho et al. (2016) 
examine how traditional integrated watershed management by 
indigenous people sustain regulating services vital to agricultural 
productivity, while delivering co-benefits in the form of biodiversity 
and ecosystem resilience at a landscape scale. Although responses 
can be site specific and sustainable at a local scale, the multi-scale 
interplay of drivers and pressures can nevertheless cause practices 
that have been sustainable for centuries to become less so. Siahaya 
et al. (2016) explore the traditional knowledge that has informed rice 
cultivation in the uplands of East Borneo, grounded in sophisticated 
shifting cultivation methods (gilir balik) which have been passed on 
for generations (more than 200 years) in order to maintain local food 
production. Gilir balik involves temporary cultivation of plots, after 
which, abandonment takes place as the land user moves to another 
plot, leaving the natural (forest) vegetation to return. This approach 
is considered sustainable if it has the support of other subsistence 
strategies, adapts to and integrates with the local context, and if 
the carrying capacity of the system is not surpassed (Siahaya et al. 
2016). Often gilir balik cultivation involves intercropping of rice with 
bananas, cassava and other food crops. Once the abandoned plot has 
been left to recover such that soil fertility is restored, clearance takes 
place again and the plot is reused for cultivation. Rice cultivation in 
this way plays an important role in forest management, with several 
different types of succession forest being found in the study by 
Siahaya et al. (2016). Nevertheless, interplay of these practices with 
other pressures (large-scale land acquisitions for oil palm plantation, 
logging and mining), risk their future sustainability. Use of fire is 
critical in processes of land clearance, so there are also trade-offs for 
climate change mitigation, which have been sparsely assessed.
Interest appears to be growing in understanding how indigenous 
and local knowledge inform land users’ responses to degradation, 
as scientists engage farmers as experts in processes of knowledge 
co-production and co-innovation (Oliver et al. 2012; Bitzer and 
Bijman 2015). This can help to introduce, implement, adapt and 
385

promote the use of locally appropriate responses (Schwilch et al. 
2011). Indeed, studies strongly agree on the importance of engaging 
local populations in both sustainable land and forest management. 
Meta-analyses in tropical regions that examined both forests in 
protected areas and community-managed forests suggest that 
deforestation rates are lower, with less variation in deforestation rates 
presenting in community-managed forests compared to protected 
forests (Porter-Bolland et al. 2012). This suggests that consideration 
of the social and economic needs of local human populations is vital 
in preventing forest degradation (Ward et al. 2018). However, while 
disciplines such as ethnopedology seek to record and understand 
how local people perceive, classify and use soil, and draw on that 
information to inform its management (Barrera-Bassols and Zinck 
2003), links with climate change and its impacts (perceived and 
actual) are not generally considered.
1.8.3 
Reducing deforestation and forest degradation 
and increasing afforestation 
Improved stewardship of forests through reduction or avoidance 
of deforestation and forest degradation, and enhancement of 
forest carbon stocks can all contribute to land-based natural 
climate solutions (Angelsen et al. 2018; Sonwa et al. 2011; Griscom 
et al. 2017). While estimates of annual emissions from tropical 
deforestation and forest degradation range widely from  0.5 
to 3.5 GtC yr–1 (Baccini et al. 2017; Houghton et al. 2012; Mitchard 
2018; see also Chapter 2), they all indicate the large potential to 
reduce annual emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. 
Recent estimates of forest extent for Africa in 1900 may result in 
downward adjustments of historic deforestation and degradation 
emission estimates (Aleman et al. 2018). Emissions from forest 
degradation in non-Annex  I  countries have declined marginally 
from 1.1 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2001–2010 to 1 GtCO2 yr–1 in 2011–2015, but 
the relative emissions from degradation compared to deforestation 
have increased from a quarter to a third (Federici et al. 2015). Forest 
sector activities in developing countries were estimated to represent 
a technical mitigation potential in 2030 of 9 GtCO2 (Miles et al. 2015). 
This was partitioned into reduction of deforestation (3.5  GtCO2), 
reduction in degradation and forest management (1.7 GtCO2) and 
afforestation and reforestation (3.8 GtCO2). The economic mitigation 
potential will be lower than the technical potential (Miles et al. 2015). 
Natural regeneration of second-growth forests enhances carbon 
sinks in the global carbon budget (Chazdon and Uriarte 2016). 
In Latin America, Chazdon et al. (2016) estimated that, in 2008, 
second-growth forests (up to 60 years old) covered  2.4  Mkm2 of 
land (28.1% of the total study area). Over 40 years, these lands can 
potentially accumulate 8.5 GtC in above-ground biomass via low-cost 
natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to 
a total CO2 sequestration of 31.1 GtCO2 (Chazdon et al. 2016b). While 
above-ground biomass carbon stocks are estimated to be declining 
in the tropics, they are increasing globally due to increasing stocks in 
temperate and boreal forests (Liu et al. 2015b), consistent with the 
observations of a global land sector carbon sink (Le Quéré et al. 2013; 
Keenan et al. 2017; Pan et al. 2011). 
Moving from technical mitigation potentials (Miles et al. 2015) to real 
reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
required transformational changes (Korhonen-Kurki et al. 2018). 
This transformation can be facilitated by two enabling conditions: 
the presence of already initiated policy change; or the scarcity of 
forest resources combined with an absence of any effective forestry 
framework and policies. These authors and others (Angelsen 
et al. 2018) found that the presence of powerful transformational 
coalitions of domestic pro-REDD+ (the United Nations Collaborative 
Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest 
Degradation in Developing Countries) political actors combined with 
strong ownership and leadership, regulations and law enforcement, 
and performance-based funding, can provide a strong incentive for 
achieving REDD+ goals. 
Implementing schemes such as REDD+ and various projects related 
to the voluntary carbon market is often regarded as a  no-regrets 
investment (Seymour and Angelsen 2012) but the social and 
ecological implications (including those identified in the Cancun 
Safeguards) must be carefully considered for REDD+ projects to be 
socially and ecologically sustainable (Jagger et al. 2015). In 2018, 
34 countries have submitted a  REDD+ forest reference level and/
or forest reference emission level to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Of these REDD+ reference 
levels, 95% included the activity ‘reducing deforestation’ while 34% 
included the activity ‘reducing forest degradation’ (FAO 2018). Five 
countries submitted REDD+ results in the technical annex to their 
Biennial Update Report totalling an emission reduction of 6.3 GtCO2 
between 2006 and 2015 (FAO 2018). 
Afforestation is another mitigation activity that increases carbon 
sequestration (Cross-Chapter Box  2  in Chapter  1). Yet, it requires 
careful consideration about where to plant trees to achieve potential 
climatic benefits, given an altering of local albedo and turbulent 
energy fluxes and increasing night-time land surface temperatures 
(Peng et al. 2014). A  recent hydro-climatic modelling effort has 
shown that forest cover can account for about 40% of the observed 
decrease in annual runoff (Buendia et al. 2016). A meta-analysis of 
afforestation in Northern Europe (Bárcena et al. 2014) concluded 
that significant soil organic carbon sequestration in Northern Europe 
occurs after afforestation of croplands but not grasslands. Additional 
sequestration occurs in forest floors and biomass carbon stocks. 
Successful programmes of large-scale afforestation activities in 
South Korea and China are discussed in-depth in a special case study 
(Section 4.9.3). 
The potential outcome of efforts to reduce emissions from 
deforestation  and degradation in Indonesia through a  2011 
moratorium on concessions to convert primary forests to either 
timber or palm oil uses was evaluated against rates of emissions 
over the period 2000 to 2010. The study concluded that less than 7% 
of emissions would have been avoided had the moratorium been 
implemented in 2000 because  it only curtailed emissions due 
to a  subset of drivers of deforestation and degradation (Busch 
et al. 2015).

Land degradation

In terms of ecological integrity of tropical forests, the policy focus 
on carbon storage and tree cover can be problematic if it leaves 
out other aspects of forests ecosystems, such as biodiversity  – 
and particularly fauna (Panfil and Harvey 2016; Peres et al. 2016; 
Hinsley et al. 2015). Other concerns of forest-based projects under 
the voluntary carbon market are potential negative socio-economic 
side effects (Edstedt and Carton 2018; Carton and Andersson 2017; 
Osborne 2011; Scheidel and Work 2018; Richards and Lyons 2016; 
Borras and Franco 2018; Paladino and Fiske 2017) and leakage 
(particularly at the subnational scale), that is, when interventions to 
reduce deforestation or degradation at one site displace pressures 
and increase emissions elsewhere (Atmadja and Verchot 2012; 
Phelps et al. 2010; Lund et al. 2017; Balooni and Lund 2014). 
Maintaining and increasing forest area, in particular native forests 
rather than monoculture and short-rotation plantations, contributes 
to the maintenance of global forest carbon stocks (Lewis et al. 2019) 
(robust evidence, high agreement).
1.8.4 
Sustainable forest management (SFM)  
and CO2 removal (CDR) technologies 
While reducing deforestation and forest degradation may directly 
help to meet mitigation goals, SFM aimed at providing timber, fibre, 
biomass and non-timber resources can provide long-term livelihood 
for communities, reduce the risk of forest conversion to non-forest 
uses (settlement, crops, etc.), and maintain land productivity, thus 
reducing the risks of land degradation (Putz et al. 2012; Gideon Neba 
et al. 2014; Sufo Kankeu et al. 2016; Nitcheu Tchiadje et al. 2016; 
Rossi et al. 2017). 
Developing SFM strategies aimed at contributing towards negative 
emissions throughout this century requires an understanding of 
forest management impacts on ecosystem carbon stocks (including 
soils), carbon sinks, carbon fluxes in harvested wood, carbon storage 
in harvested wood products, including landfills and the emission 
reductions achieved through the use of wood products and bioenergy 
(Nabuurs et al. 2007; Lemprière et al. 2013; Kurz et al. 2016; Law 
et al. 2018; Nabuurs et al. 2017). Transitions from natural to managed 
forest landscapes can involve a reduction in forest carbon stocks, the 
magnitude of which depends on the initial landscape conditions, 
the harvest rotation length relative to the frequency and intensity 
of natural disturbances, and on the age-dependence of managed 
and natural disturbances (Harmon et al. 1990; Kurz et al. 1998). 
Initial landscape conditions, in particular the age-class distribution 
and therefore carbon stocks of the landscape, strongly affect the 
mitigation potential of forest management options (Ter-Mikaelian 
et al. 2013; Kilpeläinen et al. 2017). Landscapes with predominantly 
mature forests may experience larger reductions in carbon stocks 
during the transition to managed landscapes (Harmon et al. 1990; 
Kurz et al. 1998; Lewis et al. 2019). In landscapes with predominantly 
young or recently disturbed forests, SFM can enhance carbon stocks 
(Henttonen et al. 2017). 
Forest growth rates, net primary productivity, and net ecosystem 
productivity are age-dependent, with maximum rates of CO2 removal 
(CDR) from the atmosphere occurring in young to medium-aged 
forests and declining thereafter (Tang et al. 2014). In boreal forest 
ecosystem, estimation of carbon stocks and carbon fluxes indicate 
that old growth stands are typically small carbon sinks or carbon 
sources (Gao et al. 2018; Taylor et al. 2014; Hadden and Grelle 2016). 
In tropical forests, carbon uptake rates in the first 20 years of forest 
recovery were 11 times higher than uptake rates in old-growth 
forests (Poorter et al. 2016). Age-dependent increases in forest carbon 
stocks and declines in forest carbon sinks mean that landscapes with 
older forests have accumulated more carbon but their sink strength 
is diminishing, while landscapes with younger forests contain less 
carbon but they are removing CO2 from the atmosphere at a much 
higher rate (Volkova et al. 2017; Poorter et al. 2016). The rates of 
CDR are not just age-related but also controlled by many biophysical 
factors and human activities (Bernal et al. 2018). In ecosystems with 
uneven-aged, multispecies forests, the relationships between carbon 
stocks and sinks are more difficult and expensive to quantify.
Whether or not forest harvest and use of biomass is contributing 
to net reductions of atmospheric carbon depends on carbon losses 
during and following harvest, rates of forest regrowth, and the use 
of harvested wood and carbon retention in long-lived or short-lived 
products, as well as the emission reductions achieved through the 
substitution of emissions-intensive products with wood products 
(Lemprière et al. 2013; Lundmark et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2018b; Olguin 
et al. 2018; Dugan et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2018b; Pingoud et al. 2018; 
Seidl et al. 2007). Studies that ignore changes in forest carbon stocks 
(such as some lifecycle analyses that assume no impacts of harvest on 
forest carbon stocks), ignore changes in wood product pools (Mackey 
et al. 2013) or assume long-term steady state (Pingoud et al. 2018), or 
ignore changes in emissions from substitution benefits (Mackey et al. 
2013; Lewis et al. 2019) will arrive at diverging conclusions about the 
benefits of SFM. Moreover, assessments of climate benefits of any 
mitigation action must also consider the time dynamics of atmospheric 
impacts, as some actions will have immediate benefits (e.g., avoided 
deforestation), while others may not achieve net atmospheric benefits 
for decades or centuries. For example, the climate benefits of woody 
biomass use for bioenergy depend on several factors, such as the 
source and alternate fate of the biomass, the energy type it substitutes, 
and the rates of regrowth of the harvested forest (Laganière et al. 
2017; Ter-Mikaelian et al. 2014; Smyth et al. 2017). Conversion of 
primary forests in regions of very low stand-replacing disturbances 
to short-rotation plantations where the harvested wood is used for 
short-lived products with low displacement factors will increase 
emissions. In general, greater mitigation benefits are achieved if 
harvested wood products are used for products with long carbon 
retention time and high displacement factors. 
With increasing forest age, carbon sinks in forests will diminish until 
harvest or natural disturbances, such as wildfire, remove biomass 
carbon or release it to the atmosphere (Seidl et al. 2017). While 
individual trees can accumulate carbon for centuries (Köhl et al. 2017), 
stand-level carbon accumulation rates depend on both tree growth 
and tree mortality rates (Hember et al. 2016; Lewis et al. 2004). SFM, 
including harvest and forest regeneration, can help maintain active 
carbon sinks by maintaining a  forest age-class distribution that 
includes a share of young, actively growing stands (Volkova et al. 
387
Land degradation 
Chapter 4

2018; Nabuurs et al. 2017). The use of the harvested carbon in either 
long-lived wood products (e.g., for construction), short-lived wood 
products (e.g., pulp and paper), or biofuels affects the net carbon 
balance of the forest sector (Lemprière et al. 2013; Matthews et al. 
2018). The use of these wood products can further contribute to GHG 
emission-reduction goals by avoiding the emissions from the products 
with higher embodied emissions that have been displaced (Nabuurs 
et al. 2007; Lemprière et al. 2013). In 2007 the IPCC concluded that ‘[i]n 
the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at 
maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an 
annual sustained yield of timber, fibre or energy from the forest, will 
generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit’ (Nabuurs et al. 
2007). The apparent trade-offs between maximising forest carbon 
stocks and maximising ecosystem carbon sinks are at the origin of 
ongoing debates about optimum management strategies to achieve 
negative emissions (Keith et al. 2014; Kurz et al. 2016; Lundmark 
et al. 2014). SFM, including the intensification of carbon-focused 
management strategies, can make long-term contributions towards 
negative emissions if the sustainability of management is assured 
through appropriate governance, monitoring and enforcement. As 
specified in the definition of SFM, other criteria such as biodiversity 
must also be considered when assessing mitigation outcomes 
(Lecina-Diaz et al. 2018). Moreover, the impacts of changes in 
management on albedo and other non-GHG factors also need to be 
considered (Luyssaert et al. 2018) (Chapter 2). The contribution of 
SFM for negative emissions is strongly affected by the use of the wood 
products derived from forest harvest and the time horizon over which 
the carbon balance is assessed. SFM needs to anticipate the impacts 
of climate change on future tree growth, mortality and disturbances 
when designing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies 
(Valade et al. 2017; Seidl et al. 2017).
1.8.5 
Policy responses to land degradation
The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 
(UNCED), also known as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, recognised 
land degradation as a major challenge to sustainable development, and 
led to the establishment of the UNCCD, which specifically addressed 
land degradation in the drylands. The UNCCD emphasises sustainable 
land use to link poverty reduction on one hand and environmental 
protection on the other. The two other ‘Rio Conventions’ emerging from 
the UNCED – the UNFCCC and the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD) – focus on climate change and biodiversity, respectively. The 
land has been recognised as an aspect of common interest to the three 
conventions, and SLM is proposed as a  unifying theme for current 
global efforts on combating land degradation, climate change and loss 
of biodiversity, as well as facilitating land-based adaptation to climate 
change and sustainable development. 
The Global Environmental Facility (GEF) funds developing countries 
to undertake activities that meet the goals of the conventions and 
deliver global environmental benefits. Since 2002, the GEF has 
invested in projects that support SLM through its Land Degradation 
Focal Area Strategy, to address land degradation within and beyond 
the drylands. 
Under the UNFCCC, parties have devised National Adaptation Plans 
(NAPs) that identify medium- and long-term adaptation needs. 
Parties have also developed their climate change mitigation plans, 
presented as NDCs. These programmes have the potential of assisting 
the promotion of SLM. It is understood that the root causes of land 
degradation and successful adaptation will not be realised until 
holistic solutions to land management are explored. SLM can help 
address root causes of low productivity, land degradation, loss of 
income-generating capacity, as well as contribute to the amelioration 
of the adverse effects of climate change.
The ‘4 per 1000’ (4p1000) initiative (Soussana et al. 2019) launched 
by France during the UNFCCC COP21 in 2015 aims at capturing CO2 
from the atmosphere through changes to agricultural and forestry 
practices at a rate that would increase the carbon content of soils 
by 0.4% per year (Rumpel et al. 2018). If global soil carbon content 
increases at this rate in the top 30–40 cm, the annual increase in 
atmospheric CO2 would be stopped (Dignac et al. 2017). This is an 
illustration of how extremely important soils are for addressing 
climate change. The initiative is based on eight steps: stop carbon 
loss (priority #1 is peat soils); promote carbon uptake; monitor, report 
and verify impacts; deploy technology for tracking soil carbon; test 
strategies for implementation and upscaling; involve communities; 
coordinate policies; and provide support (Rumpel et al. 2018). 
Questions remain, however, about the extent that the 4p1000 is 
achievable as a universal goal (van Groenigen et al. 2017; Poulton 
et al. 2018; Schlesinger and Amundson 2018).
LDN was introduced by the UNCCD at Rio +20, and adopted at 
UNCCD COP12 (UNCCD 2016a). LDN is defined as ‘a state whereby 
the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support 
ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security remain 
stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and 
ecosystems’(Cowie et al. 2018). Pursuit of LDN requires effort to 
avoid further net loss of the land-based natural capital relative to 
a reference state, or baseline. LDN encourages a dual-pronged effort 
involving SLM to reduce the risk of land degradation, combined with 
efforts in land restoration and rehabilitation, to maintain or enhance 
land-based natural capital, and its associated ecosystem services (Orr 
et al. 2017; Cowie et al. 2018). Planning for LDN involves projecting 
the expected cumulative impacts of land-use and land management 
decisions, then counterbalancing anticipated losses with measures to 
achieve equivalent gains, within individual land types (where land type 
is defined by land potential). Under the LDN framework developed by 
UNCCD, three primary indicators are used to assess whether LDN is 
achieved by 2030: land cover change; net primary productivity; and 
soil organic carbon (Cowie et al. 2018; Sims et al. 2019). Achieving 
LDN therefore requires integrated landscape management that seeks 
to optimise land use to meet multiple objectives (ecosystem health, 
food security, human well-being) (Cohen-Shacham et al. 2016). The 
response hierarchy of Avoid > Reduce > Reverse land degradation 
articulates the priorities in planning LDN interventions. LDN provides 
the impetus for widespread adoption of SLM and efforts to restore 
or rehabilitate land. Through its focus, LDN ultimately provides 
tremendous potential for mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate 
change by halting and reversing land degradation and transforming 
land from a  carbon source to a  sink. There are strong synergies 
388
Chapter 4 
Land degradation

between the concept of LDN and the NDCs of many countries, with 
linkages to national climate plans. LDN is also closely related to many 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in the areas of poverty, food 
security, environmental protection and sustainable use of natural 
resources (UNCCD 2016b). The GEF is supporting countries to set LDN 
targets and implement their LDN plans through its land degradation 
focal area, which encourages application of integrated landscape 
approaches to managing land degradation (GEF 2018). 
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United 
Nations in 2015, comprises 17 SDGs. Goal 15 is of direct relevance to 
land degradation, with the objective to protect, restore and promote 
sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, 
combat desertification and halt and reverse land degradation and 
halt biodiversity loss. Target 15.3 specifically addresses LDN. Other 
goals that are relevant for land degradation include Goal 2 (Zero 
hunger), Goal 3 (Good health and well-being), Goal 7 (Affordable 
and clean energy), Goal 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), 
and Goal 12 (Responsible production and consumption). Sustainable 
management of land resources underpins the SDGs related to hunger, 
climate change and environment. Further goals of a  cross-cutting 
nature include 1 (No poverty), 6 (Clean water and sanitation) and 13 
(Climate action). It remains to be seen how these interconnections 
are dealt with in practice. 
With a  focus on biodiversity, IPBES published a  comprehensive 
assessment of land degradation in 2018 (Montanarella et al. 2018). 
The IPBES report, together with this report focusing on climate 
change, may contribute to creating a  synergy between the two 
main global challenges for addressing land degradation in order to 
help achieve the targets of SDG 15 (protect, restore and promote 
sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, 
combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and 
halt biodiversity loss). 
Market-based mechanisms like the Clean Development Mechanism 
(CDM) under the UNFCCC and the voluntary carbon market provide 
incentives to enhance carbon sinks on the land through afforestation 
and reforestation. Implications for local land use and food security 
have been raised as a concern and need to be assessed (Edstedt 
and Carton 2018; Olsson et al. 2014b). Many projects aimed at 
reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradations (not 
to be confused with the national REDD+ programmes in accordance 
with the UNFCCC Warsaw Framework) are being planned and 
implemented to primarily target countries with high forest cover and 
high deforestation rates. Some parameters of incentivising emissions 
reduction, quality of forest governance, conservation priorities, local 
rights and tenure frameworks, and sub-national project potential are 
being looked into, with often very mixed results (Newton et al. 2016; 
Gebara and Agrawal 2017).
Besides international public initiatives, some actors in the private 
sector are increasingly aware of the negative environmental impacts 
of some global value chains producing food, fibre, and energy 
products (Lambin et al. 2018; van der Ven and Cashore 2018; van der 
Ven et al. 2018; Lyons-White and Knight 2018). While improvements 
are underway in many supply chains, measures implemented so 
far are often insufficient to be effective in reducing or stopping 
deforestation and forest degradation (Lambin et al. 2018). The GEF 
is investing in actions to reduce deforestation in commodity supply 
chains through its Food Systems, Land Use, and Restoration Impact 
Program (GEF 2018). 
1.8.5.1 
Limits to adaptation 
SLM can be deployed as a  powerful adaptation strategy in most 
instances of climate change impacts on natural and social systems, 
yet there are limits to adaptation (Klein et al. 2014; Dow, Berhout and 
Preston 2013). Such limits are dynamic and interact with social and 
institutional conditions (Barnett et al. 2015; Filho and Nalau 2018). 
Exceeding adaptation limits will trigger escalating losses or require 
undesirable transformational change, such as forced migration. The 
rate of change in relation to the rate of possible adaptation is crucial 
(Dow et al. 2013). How limits to adaptation are defined, and how 
they can be measured, is contextual and contested. Limits must be 
assessed in relation to the ultimate goals of adaptation, which is 
subject to diverse and differential values (Dow et al. 2013; Adger et al. 
2009). A particularly sensitive issue is whether migration is accepted 
as adaptation or not (Black et al. 2011; Tacoli 2009; Bardsley and 
Hugo 2010). If migration were understood and accepted as a form 
of successful adaptation, it would change the limits to adaptation 
by reducing, or even avoiding, future humanitarian crises caused by 
climate extremes (Adger et al. 2009; Upadhyay et al. 2017; Nalau 
et al. 2018). 
In the context of land degradation, potential limits to adaptation 
exist if land degradation becomes so severe and irreversible that 
livelihoods cannot be maintained, and if migration is either not 
acceptable or not possible. Examples are coastal erosion where land 
disappears (Gharbaoui and Blocher 2016; Luetz 2018), collapsing 
livelihoods due to thawing of permafrost (Landauer and Juhola 
2019), and extreme forms of soil erosion, (e.g., landslides (Van der 
Geest and Schindler 2016) and gully erosion leading to badlands 
(Poesen et al. 2003)).
1.8.6 
Resilience and thresholds
Resilience refers to the capacity of interconnected social, economic 
and ecological systems, such as farming systems, to absorb 
disturbance (e.g., drought, conflict, market collapse), and respond or 
reorganise, to maintain their essential function, identity and structure. 
Resilience can be described as ‘coping capacity’. The disturbance may 
be a shock – sudden events such as a flood or disease epidemic – or 
it may be a trend that develops slowly, like a drought or market shift. 
The shocks and trends anticipated to occur due to climate change are 
expected to exacerbate risk of land degradation. Therefore, assessing 
and enhancing resilience to climate change is a critical component of 
designing SLM strategies.
Resilience as an analytical lens is particularly strong in ecology and 
related research on natural resource management (Folke et al. 2010; 
Quinlan et al. 2016) while, in the social sciences, the relevance of 
resilience for studying social and ecological interactions is contested

Béné et al. 2012; Joseph 2013). In the case of adaptation to climate 
change (and particularly regarding limits to adaptation), a  crucial 
ambiguity of resilience is the question of whether resilience is 
a normative concept (i.e., resilience is good or bad) or a descriptive 
characteristic of a system (i.e., neither good nor bad). Previous IPCC 
reports have defined resilience as a normative (positive) attribute 
(see AR5 Glossary), while the wider scientific literature is divided on 
this (Weichselgartner and Kelman 2015; Strunz 2012; Brown 2014; 
Grimm and Calabrese 2011; Thorén and Olsson 2018). For example, 
is outmigration from a disaster-prone area considered a successful 
adaptation (high resilience) or a collapse of the livelihood system 
(lack of resilience) (Thorén and Olsson 2018)? In this report, resilience 
is considered a  positive attribute when it maintains capacity for 
adaptation, learning and/or transformation.
Furthermore, ‘resilience’ and the related terms ‘adaptation’ and 
‘transformation’ are defined and used differently by different 
communities (Quinlan et al. 2016). The relationship and hierarchy 
of resilience with respect to vulnerability and adaptive capacity 
are also debated, with different perspectives between disaster 
management and global change communities, (e.g.,  Cutter et al. 
2008). Nevertheless, these differences in usage need not inhibit the 
application of ‘resilience thinking’ in managing land degradation; 
researchers using these terms, despite variation in definitions, 
apply the same fundamental concepts to inform management of 
human-environment systems, to maintain or improve the resource 
base, and sustain livelihoods. 
Applying resilience concepts involves viewing the land as 
a component of an interlinked social-ecological system; identifying 
key relationships that determine system function and vulnerabilities 
of the system; identifying thresholds or tipping points beyond 
which the system transitions to an undesirable state; and devising 
management strategies to steer away from thresholds of potential 
concern, thus facilitating healthy systems and sustainable production 
(Walker et al. 2009). 
A threshold is a  non-linearity between a  controlling variable and 
system function, such that a  small change in the variable causes 
the system to shift to an alternative state. Bestelmeyer et al. (2015) 
and Prince et al. (2018) illustrate this concept in the context of 
land degradation. Studies have identified various biophysical and 
socio-economic thresholds in different land-use systems. For example, 
50% ground cover (living and dead plant material and biological 
crusts) is a  recognised threshold for dryland grazing systems 
(e.g., Tighe et al. 2012); below this threshold, the infiltration rate 
declines, risk of erosion causing loss of topsoil increases, a switch from 
perennial to annual grass species occurs and there is a consequential 
sharp decline in productivity. This shift to a lower-productivity state 
cannot be reversed without significant human intervention. Similarly, 
the combined pressure of water limitations and frequent fire can lead 
to transition from closed forest to savannah or grassland: if fire is 
too frequent, trees do not reach reproductive maturity and post-fire 
regeneration will fail; likewise, reduced rainfall/increased drought 
prevents successful forest regeneration (Reyer et al. 2015; Thompson 
et al. 2009) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2).
In managing land degradation, it is important to assess the resilience 
of the existing system, and the proposed management interventions. 
If the existing system is in an undesirable state or considered 
unviable under expected climate trends, it may be desirable to 
promote adaptation or even transformation to a  different system 
that is more resilient to future changes. For example, in an irrigation 
district where water shortages are predicted, measures could be 
implemented to improve water use efficiency, for example, by 
establishing drip irrigation systems for water delivery, although 
transformation to pastoralism or mixed dryland cropping/livestock 
production may be more sustainable in the longer term, at least 
for part of the area. Application of SLM practices, especially those 
focused on ecological functions (e.g., agroecology, ecosystem-based 
approaches, regenerative agriculture, organic farming), can be 
effective in building resilience of agro-ecosystems (Henry et al. 2018). 
Similarly, the resilience of managed forests can be enhanced by SFM 
that protects or enhances biodiversity, including assisted migration 
of tree species within their current range limit (Winder et al. 2011; 
Pedlar et al. 2012) or increasing species diversity in plantation 
forests (Felton et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2018a). The essential features 
of a resilience approach to management of land degradation under 
climate change are described by O’Connell et al. (2016) and Simonsen 
et al. (2014).
Consideration of resilience can enhance effectiveness of interventions 
to reduce or reverse land degradation (medium agreement, limited 
evidence). This approach will increase the likelihood that SLM/SFM 
and land restoration/rehabilitation interventions achieve long-term 
environmental and social benefits. Thus, consideration of resilience 
concepts can enhance the capacity of land systems to cope with 
climate change and resist land degradation, and assist land-use 
systems to adapt to climate change.
1.8.7 
Barriers to implementation of sustainable land 
management (SLM)
There is a growing recognition that addressing barriers and designing 
solutions to complex environmental problems, such as land degradation, 
requires awareness of the larger system into which the problems and 
solutions are embedded (Laniak et al. 2013). An ecosystem approach 
to sustainable land management (SLM) based on an understanding 
of land degradation processes has been recommended to separate 
multiple drivers, pressures and impacts (Kassam et al. 2013), but large 
uncertainty in model projections of future climate, and associated 
ecosystem processes (IPCC 2013a) pose additional challenges to the 
implementation of SLM. As discussed earlier in this chapter, many SLM 
practices, including technologies and approaches, are available that 
can increase yields and contribute to closing the yield gap between 
actual and potential crop or pasture yield, while also enhancing 
resilience to climate change (Yengoh and Ardö 2014; WOCAT n.d.). 
However, there are often systemic barriers to adoption and scaling up 
of SLM practices, especially in developing countries. 
Uitto (2016) identified areas that the GEF, the financial mechanism of 
the UNCCD, UNFCCC and other multilateral environmental agreements, 
can address to solve global environmental problems. These include:

removal of barriers related to knowledge and information; strategies 
for implementation of technologies and approaches; and institutional 
capacity. Strengthening these areas would drive transformational 
change, leading to behavioural change and broader adoption of 
sustainable environmental practices. Detailed analysis of barriers as 
well as strategies, methods and approaches to scale up SLM have 
been undertaken for GEF programmes in Africa, China and globally 
(Tengberg and Valencia 2018; Liniger et al. 2011; Tengberg et al. 2016). 
A number of interconnected barriers and bottlenecks to the scaling up 
of SLM have been identifi ed in this context and are related to: 
• limited access to knowledge and information, including new SLM 
technologies and problem-solving capacities 
• weak enabling environment, including the policy, institutional 
and legal framework for SLM, and land tenure and property rights 
• inadequate learning and adaptive knowledge management in 
the project cycle, including monitoring and evaluation of impacts
• limited access to fi nance for scaling up, including public and 
private funding, innovative business models for SLM technologies 
and fi nancial mechanisms and incentives, such as payment for 
ecosystem services (PES), insurance and micro-credit schemes 
(see also Shames et al. 2014). 
Adoption of innovations and new technologies are increasingly 
analysed using the transition theory framework (Geels 2002), the 
starting point being the recognition that many global environmental 
problems cannot be solved by technological change alone, but 
require more far-reaching change of social-ecological systems. Using 
transition theory makes it possible to analyse how adoption and 
implementation follow the four stages of sociotechnical transitions, 
from predevelopment of technologies and approaches at the niche 
level, take-off and acceleration, to regime shift and stabilisation at 
the landscape level. According to a recent review of sustainability 
transitions in developing countries (Wieczorek 2018), three internal 
niche processes are important, including the formation of networks 
that support and nurture innovation, the learning process, and the 
articulation of expectations to guide the learning process. While 
technologies are important, institutional and political aspects form 
the major barriers to transition and upscaling. In developing and 
transition economies, informal institutions play a pivotal role, and 
transnational linkages are also important, such as global value chains. 
In these countries, it is therefore more diffi cult to establish fully 
coherent regimes or groups of individuals who share expectations, 
beliefs or behaviour, as there is a high level of uncertainty about rules 
and social networks or dominance of informal institutions, which 
creates barriers to change. This uncertainty is further exacerbated by 
climate change. Landscape forces comprise a set of slow-changing 
factors, such as broad cultural and normative values, long-term 
economic effects such as urbanisation, and shocks such as war and 
crises that can lead to change. 
A study on SLM in the Kenyan highlands using transition theory 
concluded that barriers to adoption of SLM included high poverty 
levels, a low-input/low-output farming system with limited potential 
to generate income, diminishing land sizes, and low involvement of 
the youth in farming activities. Coupled with a  poor coordination 
of government policies for agriculture and forestry, these barriers 
created negative feedbacks in the SLM transition process. Other 
factors to consider include gender issues and lack of secure land 
tenure. Scaling up of SLM technologies would require collaboration of

diverse stakeholders across multiple scales, a more supportive policy 
environment and substantial resource mobilisation (Mutoko et al. 2014). 
Tengberg and Valencia (2018) analysed the findings from a  review 
of the GEF’s integrated natural resources management portfolio of 
projects using the transition theory framework (Figure  4.7). They 
concluded that to remove barriers to SLM, an agricultural innovations 
systems approach that supports co-production of knowledge with 
multiple stakeholders, institutional innovations, a  focus on value 
chains and strengthening of social capital to facilitate shared learning 
and collaboration could accelerate the scaling up of sustainable 
technologies and practices from the niche to the landscape level. Policy 
integration and establishment of financial mechanisms and incentives 
could contribute to overcoming barriers to a regime shift. The new SLM 
regime could, in turn, be stabilised and sustained at the landscape level 
by multi-stakeholder knowledge platforms and strategic partnerships. 
However, transitions to more sustainable regimes and practices are 
often challenged by lock-in mechanisms in the current system (Lawhon 
and Murphy 2012) such as economies of scale, investments already 
made in equipment, infrastructure and competencies, lobbying, shared 
beliefs, and practices, that could hamper wider adoption of SLM. 
Adaptive, multi-level and participatory governance of social-ecological 
systems is considered important for regime shifts and transitions to 
take place (Wieczorek 2018) and essential to secure the capacity of 
environmental assets to support societal development over longer 
time periods (Folke et al. 2005). There is also recognition that effective 
environmental policies and programmes need to be informed by 
a comprehensive understanding of the biophysical, social, and economic 
components and processes of a system, their complex interactions, and 
how they respond to different changes (Kelly (Letcher) et al. 2013). 
But blueprint policies will not work, due to the wide diversity of rules 
and informal institutions used across sectors and regions of the world, 
especially in traditional societies (Ostrom 2009).
The most effective way of removing barriers to funding of SLM has 
been mainstreaming of SLM objectives and priorities into relevant 
policy and development frameworks, and combining SLM best 
practices with economic incentives for land users. As the short-term 
costs for establishing and maintaining SLM measures are generally 
high and constitute a barrier to adoption, land users may need to 
be compensated for generation of longer-term public goods, such as 
ecosystem services. Cost-benefit analyses can be conducted on SLM 
interventions to facilitate such compensations (Liniger et al. 2011; 
Nkonya et al. 2016; Tengberg et al. 2016). The landscape approach 
is a means to reconcile competing demands on the land and remove 
barriers to implementation of SLM (e.g., Sayer et al. 2013; Bürgi et al. 
2017). It involves an increased focus on participatory governance, 
development of new SLM business models, and innovative funding 
schemes, including insurance (Shames et al. 2014). The LDN Fund 
takes a landscape approach and raises private finance for SLM and 
promotes market-based instruments, such as PES, certification and 
carbon trading, that can support scaling up of SLM to improve local 
livelihoods, sequester carbon and enhance the resilience to climate 
change (Baumber et al. 2019). 
1.9 
Case studies 
Climate change impacts on land degradation can be avoided, reduced 
or even reversed, but need to be addressed in a context-sensitive 
manner. Many of the responses described in this section can also 
provide synergies of adaptation and mitigation. In this section we 
provide more in-depth analysis of a number of salient aspects of how 
land degradation and climate change interact. Table 4.3 is a synthesis 
of how of these case studies relate to climate change and other 
broader issues in terms of co-benefits.
1.9.1 
Urban green infrastructure 
Over half of the world’s population now lives in towns and cities, 
a  proportion that is predicted to increase to about 70% by the 
middle of the century (United Nations 2015). Rapid urbanisation 
is a severe threat to land and the provision of ecosystem services 
(Seto et al. 2012). However, as cities expand, the avoidance of 
land degradation, or the maintenance/enhancement of ecosystem 
services is rarely considered in planning processes. Instead, economic 
development and the need for space for construction is prioritised, 
which can result in substantial pollution of air and water sources, 
the degradation of existing agricultural areas and indigenous, natural 
or semi-natural ecosystems both within and outside of urban areas. 
For instance, urban areas are characterised by extensive impervious 
surfaces. Degraded, sealed soils beneath these surfaces do not 
provide the same quality of water retention as intact soils. Urban 
landscapes comprising 50–90% impervious surfaces can therefore 
result in 40–83% of rainfall becoming surface water runoff (Pataki 
et al. 2011). With rainfall intensity predicted to increase in many parts 
of the world under climate change (Royal Society 2016), increased 
water runoff is going to get worse. Urbanisation, land degradation 
and climate change are therefore strongly interlinked, suggesting the 
need for common solutions (Reed and Stringer 2016). 
There is now a large body of research and application demonstrating 
the importance of retaining urban green infrastructure (UGI) for 
the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (DG Environment News 
Alert Service, 2012; Wentworth, 2017) as an important tool to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change. UGI can be defined as all 
green elements within a city, including, but not limited to, retained 
indigenous ecosystems, parks, public greenspaces, green corridors, 
street trees, urban forests, urban agriculture, green roofs/walls and 
private domestic gardens (Tzoulas et al. 2007). The definition is 
usually extended to include ‘blue’ infrastructure, such as rivers, lakes, 
bioswales and other water drainage features. The related concept 
of Nature-Based Solutions (defined as: living solutions inspired by, 
continuously supported by and using nature, which are designed 
to address various societal challenges in a  resource-efficient and 
adaptable manner and to provide simultaneously economic, social, 
and environmental benefits) has gained considerable traction within 
the European Commission as one approach to mainstreaming the 
importance of UGI (Maes and Jacobs 2017; European Union 2015).

Through retaining existing vegetation and ecosystems, revegetating 
previous developed land or integrating vegetation into buildings 
in the form of green walls and roofs, UGI can play a direct role in 
mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration. However, 
compared to overall carbon emissions from cities, effects will be small. 
Given that UGI necessarily involves the retention and management 
of non-sealed surfaces, co-benefits for land degradation (e.g., soil 
compaction avoidance, reduced water runoff, carbon storage and 
vegetation productivity (Davies et al. 2011; Edmondson et al. 2011, 
2014; Yao et al. 2015) will also be apparent. Although not currently 
a priority, its role in mitigating land degradation could be substantial. 
For instance, appropriately managed innovative urban agricultural 
production systems, such as vertical farms, could have the potential 
to meet some of the food needs of cities and reduce the production 
(and therefore degradation) pressure on agricultural land in rural 
areas, although thus far this is unproven (for a recent review, see 
Wilhelm and Smith 2018). 
The importance of UGI as part of a  climate change adaptation 
approach has received greater attention and application (Gill et al. 
2007; Fryd et al. 2011; Demuzere et al. 2014; Sussams et al. 2015). 
The EU’s Adapting to Climate Change white paper emphasises 
the ‘crucial role in adaptation in providing essential resources for 
social and economic purposes under extreme climate conditions’ 
(CEC, 2009, p. 9). Increasing vegetation cover, planting street trees 
and maintaining/expanding public parks reduces temperatures 
(Cavan et al. 2014; Di Leo et al. 2016; Feyisa et al. 2014; Tonosaki 
and Kawai 2014; Zölch et al. 2016). Further, the appropriate design 
and spatial distribution of greenspaces within cities can help to alter 
urban climates to improve human health and comfort (e.g., Brown 
and Nicholls 2015; Klemm et al. 2015). The use of green walls and 
roofs can also reduce energy use in buildings (e.g., Coma et al. 
2017). Similarly, natural flood management and ecosystem-based 
approaches of providing space for water, renaturalising rivers and 
reducing surface runoff through the presence of permeable surfaces 
and vegetated features (including walls and roofs) can manage 
flood risks, impacts and vulnerability (e.g., Gill et al. 2007; Munang 
et al. 2013). Access to UGI in times of environmental stresses and 
shock can provide safety nets for people, and so can be an important 
adaptation mechanism, both to climate change (Potschin et al. 2016) 
and land degradation. 
Most examples of UGI implementation as a  climate change 
adaptation strategy have centred on its role in water management 
for flood risk reduction. The importance for land degradation is either 
not stated, or not prioritised. In Beira, Mozambique, the government 
is using UGI to mitigate increased flood risks predicted to occur under 
climate change and urbanisation, which will be done by improving 
the natural water capacity of the Chiveve River. As part of the UGI 
approach, mangrove habitats have been restored, and future phases 
include developing new multi-functional urban green spaces along 
the river (World Bank 2016). The retention of green spaces within 
the city will have the added benefit of halting further degradation in 
those areas. Elsewhere, planning mechanisms promote the retention 
and expansion of green areas within cities to ensure ecosystem 
service delivery, which directly halts land degradation, but are largely

viewed and justified in the context of climate change adaptation 
and mitigation. For instance, the Berlin Landscape Programme 
includes five plans, one of which covers adapting to climate change 
through the recognition of the role of UGI (Green Surge 2016). Major 
climate-related challenges facing Durban, South Africa, include sea 
level rise, urban heat island, water runoff and conservation (Roberts 
and O’Donoghue 2013). Now considered a global leader in climate 
adaptation planning (Roberts 2010), Durban’s Climate Change 
Adaptation plan includes the retention and maintenance of natural 
ecosystems, in particular those that are important for mitigating 
flooding, coastal erosion, water pollution, wetland siltation and 
climate change (eThekwini Municipal Council 2014).
1.9.2 
Perennial grains and soil organic carbon (SOC) 
The severe ecological perturbation that is inherent in the conversion of 
native perennial vegetation to annual crops, and the subsequent high 
frequency of perturbation required to maintain annual crops, results 
in at least four forms of soil degradation that will be exacerbated by 
the effects of climate change (Crews et al. 2016). First, soil erosion is 
a very serious consequence of annual cropping, with median losses 
exceeding rates of formation by one to two orders of magnitude in 
conventionally plowed agroecosystems, and while erosion is reduced 
with conservation tillage, median losses still exceed formation 
by several fold (Montgomery 2007). More severe storm intensity 
associated with climate change is expected to cause even greater 
losses to wind and water erosion (Nearing et al. 2004). Second, the 
periods of time in which live roots are reduced or altogether absent 
from soils in annual cropping systems allow for substantial losses 
of nitrogen from fertilised croplands, averaging 50% globally (Ladha 
et al. 2005). This low retention of nitrogen is also expected to worsen 
with more intense weather events (Bowles et al. 2018). A  third 
impact of annual cropping is the degradation of soil structure caused 
by tillage, which can reduce infiltration of precipitation, and increase 
surface runoff. It is predicted that the percentage of precipitation 
that infiltrates into agricultural soils will decrease further under 
climate-change scenarios (Basche and DeLonge 2017; Wuest et al. 
2006). The fourth form of soil degradation that results from annual 
cropping is the reduction of soil organic matter (SOM), a topic of 
particular relevance to climate change mitigation and adaptation. 
Undegraded cropland soils can theoretically hold far more SOM 
(which is about 58% carbon) than they currently do (Soussana 
et al. 2006). We know this deficiency because, with few exceptions, 
comparisons between cropland soils and those of proximate 
mature native ecosystems commonly show a  40–75% decline in 
soil carbon attributable to agricultural practices. What happens 
when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture that induces 
such significant losses of SOM? Wind and water erosion commonly 
results in preferential removal of light organic matter fractions that 
can accumulate on or near the soil surface (Lal 2003). In addition to 
the effects of erosion, the fundamental practices of growing annual 
food and fibre crops alters both inputs and outputs of organic matter 
from most agroecosystems, resulting in net reductions in soil carbon 
equilibria (Soussana et al. 2006; McLauchlan 2006; Crews et al. 2016). 
Native vegetation of almost all terrestrial ecosystems is dominated 
by perennial plants, and the below-ground carbon allocation of 
these perennials is a key variable in determining formation rates of 
stable soil organic carbon (SOC) (Jastrow et al. 2007; Schmidt et al. 
2011). When perennial vegetation is replaced by annual crops, inputs 
of root-associated carbon (roots, exudates, mycorrhizae) decline 
substantially. For example, perennial grassland species allocate 
around 67% of productivity to roots, whereas annual crops allocate 
between 13–30% (Saugier 2001; Johnson et al. 2006). 
At the same time, inputs of SOC are reduced in annual cropping 
systems, and losses are increased because of tillage, compared to 
native perennial vegetation. Tillage breaks apart soil aggregates 
which, among other functions, are thought to inhibit soil bacteria, 
fungi and other microbes from consuming and decomposing SOM 
(Grandy and Neff 2008). Aggregates reduce microbial access to 
organic matter by restricting physical access to mineral-stabilised 
organic compounds as well as reducing oxygen availability (Cotrufo 
et al. 2015; Lehmann and Kleber 2015). When soil aggregates are 
broken open with tillage in the conversion of native ecosystems 
to agriculture, microbial consumption of SOC and subsequent 
respiration of CO2 increase dramatically, reducing soil carbon stocks 
(Grandy and Robertson 2006; Grandy and Neff 2008). 
Many management approaches are being evaluated to reduce soil 
degradation in general, especially by increasing mineral-protected 
forms of SOC in the world’s croplands (Paustian et al. 2016). The 
menu of approaches being investigated focuses either on increasing 
below-ground carbon inputs, usually through increases in total crop 
productivity, or by decreasing microbial activity, usually through 
reduced soil disturbance (Crews and Rumsey 2017). However, 
the basic biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems managed for 
production of annual crops presents serious challenges to achieving 
the standing stocks of SOC accumulated by native ecosystems that 
preceded agriculture. A novel new approach that is just starting to 
receive significant attention is the development of perennial cereal, 
legume and oilseed crops (Glover et al. 2010; Baker 2017). 
There are two basic strategies that plant breeders and geneticists are 
using to develop new perennial grain crop species. The first involves 
making wide hybrid crosses between existing elite lines of annual 
crops, such as wheat, sorghum and rice, with related wild perennial 
species in order to introgress perennialism into the genome of the 
annual (Cox et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2018; Hayes et al. 2018). The 
other approach is de novo domestication of wild perennial species 
that have crop-like traits of interest (DeHaan et al. 2016; DeHaan 
and Van Tassel 2014). New perennial crop species undergoing de 
novo domestication include intermediate wheatgrass, a relative of 
wheat that produces grain known as Kernza (DeHaan et al. 2018; 
Cattani and Asselin 2018) and Silphium integrifolium, an oilseed crop 
in the sunflower family (Van Tassel et al. 2017). Other grain crops 
receiving attention for perennialisation include pigeon pea, barley, 
buckwheat and maize (Batello et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2018c) and 
a number of legume species (Schlautman et al. 2018). In most cases, 
the seed yields of perennial grain crops under development are 
well below those of elite modern grain varieties. During the period 
that it will take for intensive breeding efforts to close the yield and 
other trait gaps between annual and perennial grains, perennial

proto-crops may be used for purposes other than grain, including 
forage production (Ryan et al. 2018). Perennial rice stands out as 
a high-yielding exception, as its yields matched those of elite local 
varieties in the Yunnan Province for six growing seasons over three 
years (Huang et al. 2018). 
In a  perennial agroecosystem, the biogeochemical controls on 
SOC accumulation shift dramatically, and begin to resemble the 
controls that govern native ecosystems (Crews et al. 2016). When 
erosion is reduced or halted, and crop allocation to roots increases 
by 100–200%, and when soil aggregates are not disturbed thus 
reducing microbial respiration, SOC levels are expected to increase 
(Crews and Rumsey 2017). Deep roots growing year round are 
also effective at increasing nitrogen retention (Culman et al. 
2013; Jungers et al. 2019). Substantial increases in SOC have been 
measured where croplands that had historically been planted to 
annual grains were converted to perennial grasses, such as in the US 
Conservation Reserve Program or in plantings of second-generation 
perennial biofuel crops. Two studies have assessed carbon 
accumulation in soils when croplands were converted to the 
perennial grain Kernza. In one, researchers found no differences 
in soil labile (permanganate-oxidisable) carbon after four years 
of cropping to perennial Kernza versus annual wheat in a sandy 
textured soil. Given that coarse textured soils do not offer the same 
physicochemical protection against microbial attack as many finer 
textured soils, these results are not surprising, but these results do 
underscore how variable the rates of carbon accumulation can be 
(Jastrow et al. 2007). In the second study, researchers assessed the 
carbon balance of a Kernza field in Kansas, USA over 4.5 years using 
eddy covariance observations (de Oliveira et al. 2018). They found 
that the net carbon accumulation rate of about 1500 gC m–2 yr–1 
in the first year of the study corresponding to the biomass of 
Kernza, increasing to about 300 gC m–2 yr–1 in the final year, where 
CO2 respiration losses from the decomposition of roots and SOM 
approached new carbon inputs from photosynthesis. Based on 
measurements of soil carbon accumulation in restored grasslands 
in this part of the USA, the net carbon accumulation in stable 
organic matter under a perennial grain crop might be expected to 
sequester 30–50 gC m–2 yr–1 (Post and Kwon 2000) until a new 
equilibrium is reached. Sugar cane, a highly productive perennial, 
has been shown to accumulate a mean of 187 gC m–2 yr–1 in Brazil 
(La Scala Júnior et al. 2012). 
Reduced soil erosion, increased nitrogen retention, greater water 
uptake efficiency and enhanced carbon sequestration represent 
improved ecosystem functions, made possible in part by deep and 
extensive root systems of perennial crops (Figure 4.8).
When compared to annual grains like wheat, single species stands 
of deep-rooted perennial grains such as Kernza are expected to 
reduce soil erosion, increase nitrogen retention, achieve greater 
water uptake efficiency and enhance carbon sequestration (Crews 
et al. 2018) (Figure  4.8). An even higher degree of ecosystem 
services can, at least theoretically, be achieved by strategically 
combining different functional groups of crops such as a cereal and 
a nitrogen-fixing legume (Soussana and Lemaire 2014). Not only is 
there evidence from plant-diversity experiments that communities 
with higher species richness sustain higher concentrations of SOC 
(Hungate et al. 2017; Sprunger and Robertson 2018;  Chen, S. 2018; 
Yang et al. 2019), but other valuable ecosystem services such as pest 
suppression, lower GHG emissions, and greater nutrient retention 
may be enhanced (Schnitzer et al. 2011; Culman et al. 2013).
Similar to perennial forage crops such as alfalfa, perennial grain 
crops are expected to have a definite productive lifespan, probably 
in the range of three to 10 years. A key area of research on perennial 
grains cropping systems is to minimise losses of SOC during 
conversion of one stand of perennial grains to another. Recent 
work demonstrates that no-till conversion of a mature perennial 
grassland to another perennial crop will experience several years of 
high net CO2 emissions as decomposition of copious crop residues 
exceed ecosystem uptake of carbon by the new crop (Abraha et al. 
2018). Most, if not all, of this lost carbon will be recaptured in 
the replacement crop. It is not known whether mineral-stabilised 
carbon that is protected in soil aggregates is vulnerable to loss in 
perennial crop succession.

Perennial grains hold promises of agricultural practices, which 
can significantly reduce soil erosion and nutrient leakage while 
sequestering carbon. When cultivated in mixes with N-fixing species 
(legumes) such polycultures also reduce the need for external inputs 
of nitrogen – a large source of GHG from conventional agriculture.

Reversing land degradation through 
reforestation 
1.9.3.1 
South Korea case study on reforestation success
In the first half of the 20th century, forests in the Republic of Korea 
(South Korea) were severely degraded and deforested during foreign 
occupations and the Korean War. Unsustainable harvest for timber 
and fuelwood resulted in severely degraded landscapes, heavy soil 
erosion and large areas denuded of vegetation cover. Recognising 
that South Korea’s economic health would depend on a  healthy 
environment, South Korea established a  national forest service 
(1967) and embarked on the first phase of a 10-year reforestation 
programme in 1973 (Forest Development Program), which was 
followed by subsequent reforestation programmes that ended in 
1987, after 2.4 Mha of forests were restored (Figure 4.9).
As a  consequence of reforestation, forest volume increased from 
11.3 m3 ha–1 in 1973 to 125.6 m3 ha–1 in 2010 and 150.2 m3 ha–1 
in 2016 (Korea Forest Service 2017). Increases in forest volume had 
significant co-benefits such as increasing water yield by 43% and 
reducing soil losses by 87% from 1971 to 2010 (Kim et al. 2017).
The forest carbon density in South Korea has increased 
from 5–7 MgC ha–1 in the period 1955–1973 to more than 30 MgC ha–1 
in the late 1990s (Choi et al. 2002). Estimates of carbon uptake rates 
in the late 1990s were 12 TgC yr–1 (Choi et al. 2002). For the period 
1954 to 2012, carbon uptake was 8.3 TgC yr–1 (Lee et al. 2014), lower 
than other estimates because reforestation programmes did not 
start until 1973. Net ecosystem production in South Korea was 10.55 
± 1.09 TgC yr−1 in the 1980s, 10.47 ± 7.28 Tg C yr−1 in the 1990s, 
and 6.32 ± 5.02 Tg C yr−1 in the 2000s, showing a gradual decline 
as average forest age increased (Cui et al. 2014). The estimated past 
and projected future increase in the carbon content of South Korea’s 
forest area during 1992–2034 was 11.8 TgC yr–1 (Kim et al. 2016). 
During the period of forest restoration, South Korea also promoted 
inter-agency cooperation and coordination, especially between 
the energy and forest sectors, to replace firewood with fossil fuels, 
and to reduce demand for firewood to help forest recovery (Bae 
et al. 2012). As experience with forest restoration programmes has 
increased, emphasis has shifted from fuelwood plantations, often

restoration, the third photo about five years after restoration, and the bottom photo was taken about 20 years after restoration. Many examples of such restoration success exist 
throughout South Korea. (Photos: Copyright © Korea Forest Service)

with exotic species and hybrid varieties to planting more native 
species and encouraging natural regeneration (Kim and Zsuffa 1994; 
Lee et al. 2015). Avoiding monocultures in reforestation programmes 
can reduce susceptibility to pests (Kim and Zsuffa 1994). Other 
important factors in the success of the reforestation programme 
were that private landowners were heavily involved in initial efforts 
(both corporate entities and smallholders) and that the reforestation 
programme was made part of the national economic development 
programme (Lamb 2014). 
The net present value and the cost-benefit ratio of the reforestation 
programme were 54.3  billion and  5.84  billion USD in 2010, 
respectively. The breakeven point of the reforestation investment 
appeared within two decades. Substantial benefits of the 
reforestation programme included disaster risk reduction and carbon 
sequestration (Lee et al. 2018a).
In summary, the reforestation programme was a  comprehensive 
technical and social initiative that restored forest ecosystems, 
enhanced the economic performance of rural regions, contributed 
to disaster risk reduction, and enhanced carbon sequestration (Kim 
et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2018a; UNDP 2017). 
The success of the reforestation programme in South Korea and 
the associated significant carbon sink indicate a  high mitigation 
potential that might be contributed by a potential future reforestation 
programme in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North 
Korea) (Lee et al. 2018b).
1.9.3.2 
China case study on reforestation success
The dramatic decline in the quantity and quality of natural forests 
in China resulted in land degradation, such as soil erosion, floods, 
droughts, carbon emission, and damage to wildlife habitat (Liu and 
Diamond 2008). In response to failures of previous forestry and 
land policies, the severe droughts in 1997, and the massive floods 
in 1998, the central government decided to implement a series of 
land degradation control policies, including the National Forest 
Protection Program (NFPP), Grain for Green or the Conversion of 
Cropland to Forests and Grassland Program (GFGP) (Liu et al. 2008; 
Yin 2009; Tengberg et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2000). The NFPP aimed 
to completely ban logging of natural forests in the upper reaches of 
the Yangtze and Yellow rivers as well as in Hainan Province by 2000 
and to substantially reduce logging in other places (Xu et al. 2006). 
In 2011, NFPP was renewed for the 10-year second phase, which also 
added another 11 counties around Danjiangkou Reservoir in Hubei 
and Henan Provinces, the water source for the middle route of the 
South-to-North Water Diversion Project (Liu et al. 2013). Furthermore, 
the NFPP afforested 31 Mha by 2010 through aerial seeding, artificial 
planting, and mountain closure (i.e., prohibition of human activities 
such as fuelwood collection and lifestock grazing) (Xu et al. 2006). 
China banned commercial logging in all natural forests by the end 
of 2016, which imposed logging bans and harvesting reductions 
in 68.2 Mha of forest land – including 56.4 Mha of natural forest 
(approximately 53% of China’s total natural forests).
GFGP became the most ambitious of China’s ecological restoration 
efforts, with more than 45 billion USD devoted to its implementation 
since 1990 (Kolinjivadi and Sunderland 2012) The programme involves 
the conversion of farmland on slopes of 15–25° or greater to forest 
or grassland (Bennett 2008). The pilot programme started in three 
provinces – Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu – in 1999 (Liu and Diamond 
2008). After its initial success, it was extended to 17 provinces by 
2000 and finally to all provinces by 2002, including the headwaters 
of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers (Liu et al. 2008). 
NFPP and GFGP have dramatically improved China’s land conditions 
and ecosystem services, and thus have mitigated the unprecedented 
land degradation in China (Liu et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2002; Long 
et al. 2006; Xu et al. 2006). NFPP protected 107 Mha forest area 
and increased forest area by 10 Mha between 2000 and 2010. For 
the second phase (2011–2020), the NFPP plans to increase forest 
cover by a  further  5.2  Mha, capture 416  million tons of carbon, 
provide 648,500 forestry jobs, further reduce land degradation, and 
enhance biodiversity (Liu et al. 2013). During 2000–2007, sediment 
concentration in the Yellow River had declined by 38%. In the Yellow 
River basin, it was estimated that surface runoff would be reduced 
by 450 million m3 from 2000 to 2020, which is equivalent to 0.76% 
of the total surface water resources (Jia  et al. 2006). GFGP had 
cumulatively increased vegetative cover by 25 Mha, with 8.8 Mha 
of cropland being converted to forest and grassland, 14.3  Mha 
barren land being afforested, and 2.0 Mha of forest regeneration 
from mountain closure. Forest cover within the GFGP region has 
increased 2% during the first eight years (Liu et al. 2008). In Guizhou 
Province, GFGP plots had 35–53% less loss of phosphorus than 
non-GFGP plots (Liu et al. 2002). In Wuqi County of Shaanxi Province, 
the Chaigou Watershed had 48% and 55% higher soil moisture 
and moisture-holding capacity in GFGP plots than in non-GFGP 
plots, respectively (Liu et al. 2002). According to reports on China’s 
first national ecosystem assessment (2000–2010), for carbon 
sequestration and soil retention, coefficients for the GFGP targeting 
forest restoration and NFPP are positive and statistically significant. 
For sand fixation, GFGP targeting grassland restoration is positive 
and statistically significant. Remote sensing observations confirm 
that vegetation cover increased and bare soil declined in China over 
the period 2001 to 2015 (Qiu et al. 2017). But, where afforestation 
is sustained by drip irrigation from groundwater, questions about 
plantation sustainability arise (Chen et al. 2018a). Moreover, greater 
gains in biodiversity could be achieved by promoting mixed forests 
over monocultures (Hua et al. 2016).
NFPP-related activities received a total commitment of 93.7 billion 
yuan (about 14 billion USD at 2018 exchange rate) between 1998 
and 2009. Most of the money was used to offset economic losses of 
forest enterprises caused by the transformation from logging to tree 
plantations and forest management (Liu et al. 2008). By 2009, the 
cumulative total investment through the NFPP and GFGP exceeded 
50  billion USD2009 and directly involved more than 120  million 
farmers in 32 million households in the GFGP alone (Liu et al. 2013). 
All programmes reduce or reverse land degradation and improve 
human well-being. Thus, a  coupled human and natural systems 
perspective (Liu et al. 2008) would be helpful to understand the 
complexity of policies and their impacts, and to establish long-term

management mechanisms to improve the livelihood of participants 
in these programmes and other land management policies in China 
and many other parts of the world.
1.9.4 
Degradation and management of peat soils
Globally, peatlands cover  3–4%  of the Earth’s land area (about 
430 Mha) (Xu et al. 2018a) and store 26–44% of estimated global 
SOC (Moore 2002). They are most abundant in high northern 
latitudes, covering large areas in North America, Russia and Europe. 
At lower latitudes, the largest areas of tropical peatlands are located 
in Indonesia, the Congo Basin and the Amazon Basin in the form of 
peat swamp forests (Gumbricht et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2018a). It is 
estimated that, while 80–85% of the global peatland areas is still 
largely in a natural state, they are such carbon-dense ecosystems that 
degraded peatlands (0.3% of the terrestrial land) are responsible for 
a disproportional 5% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions – that 
is, an annual addition of 0.9–3 GtCO2 to the atmosphere (Dommain 
et al. 2012; IPCC 2014c).
Peatland degradation is not well quantified globally, but regionally 
peatland degradation can involve a large percentage of the areas. 
Land-use change and degradation in tropical peatlands have 
primarily been quantified in Southeast Asia, where drainage and 
conversion to plantation crops is the dominant transition (Miettinen 
et al. 2016). Degradation of peat swamps in Peru is also a growing 
concern and one pilot survey showed that more than 70% of the 
peat swamps were degraded in one region surveyed (Hergoualc’h 
et al. 2017a). Around 65,000 km2 or 10% of the European peatland 
area has been lost and 44% of the remaining European peatlands 
are degraded (Joosten, H., Tanneberger 2017). Large areas of fens 
have been entirely ‘lost’ or greatly reduced in thickness due to peat 
wastage (Lamers et al. 2015). 
The main drivers of the acceleration of peatland degradation in the 
20th century were associated with drainage for agriculture, peat 
extraction and afforestation related activities (burning, over-grazing, 
fertilisation) with a variable scale and severity of impact depending 
on existing resources in the various countries (O’Driscoll et al. 2018; 
Cobb, A.R. et al. Dommain et al. 2018; Lamers et al. 2015). New drivers 
include urban development, wind farm construction (Smith et al. 
2012), hydroelectric development, tar sands mining and recreational 
uses (Joosten and Tanneberger 2017). Anthropogenic pressures are 
now affecting peatlands in previously geographically isolated areas 
with consequences for global environmental concerns and impacts 
on local livelihoods (Dargie et al. 2017; Lawson et al. 2015; Butler 
et al. 2009).
Drained and managed peatlands are GHG-emission hotspots (Swails 
et al. 2018; Hergoualc’h et al. 2017a, 2017b; Roman-Cuesta et al. 
2016). In most cases, lowering of the water table leads to direct 
and indirect CO2 and N2O emissions to the atmosphere, with rates 
dependent on a range of factors, including the groundwater level and 
the water content of surface peat layers, nutrient content, temperature, 
and vegetation communities. The exception is nutrient-limited boreal 
peatlands (Minkkinen et al. 2018; Ojanen et al. 2014). Drainage also 
increases erosion and dissolved organic carbon loss, removing stored 
carbon into streams as dissolved and particulate organic carbon, 
which ultimately returns to the atmosphere (Moore et al. 2013; Evans 
et al. 2016). 
In tropical peatlands, oil palm is the most widespread plantation crop 
and, on average, it emits around 40 tCO2 ha–1 yr–1; Acacia plantations 
for pulpwood are the second most widespread plantation crop and 
emit around 73 tCO2 ha–1 yr–1 (Drösler et al. 2013). Other land uses 
typically emit less than 37  tCO2  ha–1  yr–1. Total emissions from 
peatland drainage in the region are estimated to be between 0.07 
and 1.1 GtCO2 yr–1 (Houghton and Nassikas 2017; Frolking et al. 2011). 
Land-use change also affects the fluxes of N2O and CH4. Undisturbed 
tropical peatlands emit about 0.8 MtCH4 yr–1 and 0.002 MtN2O yr–1, 
while disturbed peatlands emit 0.1 MtCH4 yr–1and 0.2 MtN2O–N yr–1 
(Frolking et al. 2011). These N2O emissions are probably low, as new 
findings show that emissions from fertilised oil palm can exceed 
20 kgN2O–N ha–1 yr–1 (Oktarita et al. 2017). 
In the temperate and boreal zones, peatland drainage often leads to 
emissions in the order of 0.9 to 9.5 tCO2 ha–1 y–1 in forestry plantations 
and 21 to 29 tCO2 ha–1 y–1 in grasslands and croplands. Nutrient-poor 
sites often continue to be CO2 sinks for long periods (e.g., 50 years) 
following drainage and, in some cases, sinks for atmospheric CH4, 
even when drainage ditch emissions are considered (Minkkinen 
et al. 2018; Ojanen et al. 2014). Undisturbed boreal and temperate 
peatlands emit about 30 MtCH4 yr–1 and 0.02 MtN2O–N yr–1, while 
disturbed peatlands emit  0.1  MtCH4  yr–1and  0.2  MtN2O–N yr–1 
(Frolking et al. 2011).
Fire emissions from tropical peatlands are only a  serious issue in 
Southeast Asia, where they are responsible for 634 (66–4070) 
MtCO2  yr–1 (van der Werf et al. 2017). Much of the variability is 
linked with the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which produces 
drought conditions in this region. Anomalously active fire seasons 
have also been observed in non-drought years and this has been 
attributed to the increasing effect of high temperatures that dry 
vegetation out during short dry spells in otherwise normal rainfall 
years (Fernandes et al. 2017; Gaveau et al. 2014). Fires have 
significant societal impacts; for example, the 2015 fires caused more 
than 100,000 additional deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia and 
Singapore, and this event was more than twice as deadly as the 2006 
El Niño event (Koplitz et al. 2016). 
Peatland degradation in other parts of the world differs from Asia. In 
Africa, for large peat deposits like those found in the Cuvette Centrale 
in the Congo Basin or in the Okavango inland delta, the principle threat 
is changing rainfall regimes due to climate variability and change 
(Weinzierl et al. 2016; Dargie et al. 2017). Expansion of agriculture is not 
yet a major factor in these regions. In the Western Amazon, extraction 
of non-timber forest products like the fruits of Mauritia flexuosa 
(moriche palm) and Suri worms are major sources of degradation that 
lead to losses of carbon stocks (Hergoualc’h et al. 2017a).
The effects of peatland degradation on livelihoods have not been 
systematically characterised. In places where plantation crops are 
driving the conversion of peat swamps, the financial benefits can 
398
Chapter 4

be considerable. One study in Indonesia found that the net present 
value of an oil palm plantation is between 3,835 and 9,630 USD 
per ha to land owners (Butler et al. 2009). High financial returns are 
creating incentives for the expansion of smallholder production in 
peatlands. Smallholder plantations extend over 22% of the peatlands 
in insular Southeast Asia compared to 27% for industrial plantations 
(Miettinen et al. 2016). In places where income is generated from 
extraction of marketable products, ecosystem degradation probably 
has a negative effect on livelihoods. For example, the sale of fruits 
of M. flexuosa in some parts of the western Amazon constitutes as 
much as 80% of the winter income of many rural households, but 
information on trade values and value chains of M. flexuosa is still 
sparse (Sousa et al. 2018; Virapongse et al. 2017). 
There is little experience with peatland restoration in the tropics. 
Experience from northern latitudes suggests that extensive damage 
and changes in hydrological conditions mean that restoration in 
many cases is unachievable (Andersen et al. 2017). In the case of 
Southeast Asia, where peatlands form as raised bogs, drainage leads 
to collapse of the dome, and this collapse cannot be reversed by 
rewetting. Nevertheless, efforts are underway to develop solutions, 
or at least partial solutions in Southeast Asia, for example, by the 
Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency. The first step is to restore 
the hydrological regime in drained peatlands, but so far experiences 
with canal blocking and reflooding of the peat have been only 
partially successful (Ritzema et al. 2014). Market incentives with 
certification through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil have 
also not been particularly successful as many concessions seek 
certification only after significant environmental degradation has 
occurred (Carlson et al. 2017). Certification had no discernible effect 
on forest loss or fire detection in peatlands in Indonesia. To date there 
is no documentation of restoration methods or successes in many 
other parts of the tropics. However, in situations where degradation 
does not involve drainage, ecological restoration may be possible. In 
South America, for example, there is growing interest in restoration 
of palm swamps, and as experiences are gained it will be important 
to document success factors to inform successive efforts (Virapongse 
et al. 2017).
In higher latitudes where degraded peatlands have been drained, 
the most effective option to reduce losses from these large organic 
carbon stocks is to change hydrological conditions and increase 
soil moisture and surface wetness (Regina et al. 2015). Long-term 
GHG monitoring in boreal sites has demonstrated that rewetting 
and restoration noticeably reduce emissions compared to degraded 
drained sites and can restore the carbon sink function when 
vegetation is re-established (Wilson et al. 2016; IPCC 2014a; Nugent 
et al. 2018) although, restored ecosystems may not yet be as resilient 
as their undisturbed counterparts (Wilson et al. 2016). Several 
studies have demonstrated the co-benefits of rewetting specific 
degraded peatlands for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, (Parry 
et al. 2014; Ramchunder et al. 2012; Renou-Wilson et al. 2018) and 
other ecosystem services, such as improvement of water storage and 
quality (Martin-Ortega et al. 2014) with beneficial consequences for 
human well-being (Bonn et al. 2016; Parry et al. 2014). 
1.9.5 
Biochar 
Biochar is organic matter that is carbonised by heating in an 
oxygen-limited environment, and used as a  soil amendment. The 
properties of biochar vary widely, dependent on the feedstock and 
the conditions of production. Biochar could make a  significant 
contribution to mitigating both land degradation and climate 
change, simultaneously.
1.9.5.1 
 Role of biochar in climate change mitigation
Biochar is relatively resistant to decomposition compared with fresh 
organic matter or compost, so represents a long-term carbon store 
(very high confidence). Biochars produced at higher temperature 
(>450°C) and from woody material have greater stability than those 
produced at lower temperature (300–450°C), and from manures 
(very high confidence) (Singh et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2016b). Biochar 
stability is influenced by soil properties: biochar carbon can be further 
stabilised by interaction with clay minerals and native SOM (medium 
evidence) (Fang et al. 2015). Biochar stability is estimated to range 
from decades to thousands of years, for different biochars in different 
applications (Singh et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016). Biochar stability 
decreases as ambient temperature increases (limited evidence) (Fang 
et al. 2017).
Biochar can enhance soil carbon stocks through ‘negative priming’, in 
which rhizodeposits are stabilised through sorption of labile carbon 
on biochar, and formation of biochar-organo-mineral complexes 
(Weng et al. 2015, 2017, 2018; Wang et al. 2016b). Conversely, some 
studies show increased turnover of native soil carbon  (‘positive 
priming’) due to enhanced soil microbial activity induced by biochar. 
In clayey soils, positive priming is minor and short-lived compared 
to negative priming effects, which dominate in the medium to long 
term (Singh and Cowie 2014; Wang et al. 2016b). Negative priming 
has been observed particularly in loamy grassland soil (Ventura et al. 
2015) and clay-dominated soils, whereas positive priming is reported 
in sandy soils (Wang et al. 2016b) and those with low carbon content 
(Ding et al. 2018). 
Biochar can provide additional climate-change mitigation by 
decreasing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil, due in part to 
decreased substrate availability for denitrifying organisms, related to 
the molar H/C ratio of the biochar (Cayuela et al. 2015). However, 
this impact varies widely: meta-analyses found an average decrease 
in N2O emissions from soil of 30–54%, (Cayuela et al. 2015; Borchard 
et al. 2019; Moore 2002), although another study found no significant 
reduction in field conditions when weighted by the inverse of the 
number of observations per site (Verhoeven et al. 2017). Biochar has 
been observed to reduce methane emissions from flooded soils, such 
as rice paddies, though, as for N2O, results vary between studies and 
increases have also been observed (He et al. 2017; Kammann et al. 
2017). Biochar has also been found to reduce methane uptake by 
dryland soils, though the effect is small in absolute terms (Jeffery 
et al. 2016). 
Additional climate benefits of biochar can arise through: reduced 
nitrogen fertiliser requirements, due to reduced losses of nitrogen

through leaching and/or volatilisation (Singh et al. 2010) and enhanced 
biological nitrogen fixation (Van Zwieten et al. 2015); increased yields 
of crop, forage, vegetable and tree species (Biederman and Harpole 
2013), particularly in sandy soils and acidic tropical soils (Simon et al. 
2017); avoided GHG emissions from manure that would otherwise be 
stockpiled, crop residues that would be burned or processing residues 
that would be landfilled; and reduced GHG emissions from compost 
when biochar is added (Agyarko-Mintah et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017a).
Climate benefits of biochar could be substantially reduced through 
reduction in albedo if biochar is surface-applied at high rates to 
light-coloured soils (Genesio et al. 2012; Bozzi et al. 2015; Woolf 
et al. 2010), or if black carbon dust is released (Genesio et al. 2016). 
Pelletising or granulating biochar, and applying below the soil surface 
or incorporating into the soil, minimises the release of black carbon 
dust and reduces the effect on albedo (Woolf et al. 2010).
Biochar is a  potential ‘negative emissions’ technology: the 
thermochemical conversion of biomass to biochar slows mineralisation 
of the biomass, delivering long-term carbon storage; gases released 
during pyrolysis can be combusted for heat or power, displacing fossil 
energy sources, and could be captured and sequestered if linked with 
infrastructure for CCS (Smith 2016). Studies of the lifecycle climate 
change impacts of biochar systems generally show emissions reduction 
in the range 0.4 –1.2 tCO2e t–1 (dry) feedstock (Cowie et al. 2015). Use of 
biomass for biochar can deliver greater benefits than use for bioenergy, 
if applied in a  context where it delivers agronomic benefits and/or 
reduces non-CO2 GHG emissions (Ji et al. 2018; Woolf et al. 2010, 2018; 
Xu et al. 2019). A global analysis of technical potential, in which biomass 
supply constraints were applied to protect against food insecurity, 
loss of habitat and land degradation, estimated technical potential 
abatement of  3.7–6.6  GtCO2e yr–1 (including  2.6–4.6  GtCO2e  yr–1 
carbon stabilisation), with theoretical potential to reduce total 
emissions over the course of a century by 240–475 GtCO2e (Woolf et al. 
2010). Fuss et al. (2018) propose a range of 0.5–2 GtCO2e per year 
as the sustainable potential for negative emissions through biochar. 
Mitigation potential of biochar is reviewed in Chapter 2. 
1.9.5.2 
Role of biochar in management of land degradation
Biochars generally have high porosity, high surface area and 
surface-active properties that lead to high absorptive and adsorptive 
capacity, especially after interaction in soil (Joseph et al. 2010). As 
a  result of these properties, biochar could contribute to avoiding, 
reducing and reversing land degradation through the following 
documented benefits:
• Improved nutrient use efficiency due to reduced leaching of 
nitrate and ammonium (e.g., Haider et al. 2017) and increased 
availability of phosphorus in soils with high phosphorus fixation 
capacity (Liu et al. 2018c), potentially reducing nitrogen and 
phosphorus fertiliser requirements. 
• Management of heavy metals and organic pollutants: through 
reduced bioavailability of toxic elements (O’Connor et al. 2018; 
Peng et al. 2018), by reducing availability, through immobilisation 
due to increased pH and redox effects (Rizwan et al. 2016) and 
adsorption on biochar surfaces (Zhang et al. 2013) thus providing 
a means of remediating contaminated soils, and enabling their 
utilisation for food production.
• Stimulation of beneficial soil organisms, including earthworms 
and mycorrhizal fungi (Thies et al. 2015).
• Improved porosity and water-holding capacity (Quin et al. 2014), 
particularly in sandy soils (Omondi et al. 2016), enhancing 
microbial function during drought (Paetsch et al. 2018).
• Amelioration of soil acidification, through application of biochars 
with high pH and acid-neutralising capacity (Chan et al. 2008; 
Van Zwieten et al. 2010). 
Biochar systems can deliver a range of other co-benefits, including 
destruction of pathogens and weed propagules, avoidance of landfill, 
improved handling and transport of wastes such as sewage sludge, 
management of biomass residues such as environmental weeds and 
urban greenwaste, reduction of odours and management of nutrients 
from intensive livestock facilities, reduction in environmental nitrogen 
pollution and protection of waterways. As a compost additive, biochar 
has been found to reduce leaching and volatilisation of nutrients, 
increasing nutrient retention through absorption and adsorption 
processes (Joseph et al. 2018). 
While many studies report positive responses, some studies have 
found negative or zero impacts on soil properties or plant response 
(e.g.,  Kuppusamy et al. 2016). The risk that biochar may enhance 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in soil or sediments has been 
raised (Quilliam et al. 2013; Ojeda et al. 2016), but bioavailability 
of PAH in biochar has been shown to be very low (Hilber 
et al. 2017) Pyrolysis of biomass leads to losses of volatile nutrients, 
especially nitrogen. While availability of nitrogen and phosphorus in 
biochar is lower than in fresh biomass, (Xu et al. 2016) the impact of 
biochar on plant uptake is determined by the interactions between 
biochar, soil minerals and activity of microorganisms (e.g., Vanek and 
Lehmann 2015; Nguyen et al. 2017). To avoid negative responses, it 
is important to select biochar formulations to address known soil 
constraints, and to apply biochar prior to planting (Nguyen et al. 
2017). Nutrient enrichment improves the performance of biochar 
from low nutrient feedstocks (Joseph et al. 2013). While there are 
many reports of biochar reducing disease or pest incidence, there are 
also reports of nil or negative effects (Bonanomi et al. 2015). Biochar 
may induce systemic disease resistance (e.g., Elad et al. 2011), 
though Viger et al. (2015) reported down-regulation of plant defence 
genes, suggesting increased susceptibility to insect and pathogen 
attack. Disease suppression where biochar is applied is associated 
with increased microbial diversity and metabolic potential of the 
rhizosphere microbiome (Kolton et al. 2017). Differences in properties 
related to feedstock (Bonanomi et al. 2018) and differential response 
to biochar dose, with lower rates more effective (Frenkel et al. 2017), 
contribute to variable disease responses.
The constraints on biochar adoption include: the high cost and 
limited availability due to limited large-scale production; limited 
amount of unutilised biomass; and competition for land for growing 
biomass. While early biochar research tended to use high rates of 
application (10 t ha–1 or more) subsequent studies have shown that 
biochar can be effective at lower rates, especially when combined 
400

with chemical or organic fertilisers (Joseph et al. 2013). Biochar can 
be produced at many scales and levels of engineering sophistication, 
from simple cone kilns and cookstoves to large industrial-scale units 
processing several tonnes of biomass per hour (Lehmann and Joseph 
2015). Substantial technological development has occurred recently, 
though large-scale deployment is limited to date.
Governance of biochar is required to manage climate, human health 
and contamination risks associated with biochar production in poorly 
designed or operated facilities that release methane or particulates 
(Downie et al. 2012; Buss et al. 2015), to ensure quality control of 
biochar products, and to ensure that biomass is sourced sustainably 
and is uncontaminated. Measures could include labelling standards, 
sustainability certification schemes and regulation of biochar 
production and use. Governance mechanisms should be tailored to 
context, commensurate with risks of adverse outcomes.
In summary, application of biochar to soil can improve soil chemical, 
physical and biological attributes, enhancing productivity and 
resilience to climate change, while also delivering climate-change 
mitigation through carbon sequestration and reduction in GHG 
emissions (medium agreement, robust evidence). However, responses 
to biochar depend on the biochar’s properties, which are in turn 
dependent on feedstock and biochar production conditions, and the 
soil and crop to which it is applied. Negative or nil results have been 
recorded. Agronomic and methane-reduction benefits appear greatest 
in tropical regions, where acidic soils predominate and suboptimal 
rates of lime and fertiliser are common, while carbon stabilisation is 
greater in temperate regions. Biochar is most effective when applied 
in low volumes to the most responsive soils and when properties are 
matched to the specific soil constraints and plant needs. Biochar is 
thus a practice that has potential to address land degradation and 
climate change simultaneously, while also supporting sustainable 
development. The potential of biochar is limited by the availability 
of biomass for its production. Biochar production and use requires 
regulation and standardisation to manage risks (strong agreement).
1.9.6 
Management of land degradation induced 
by tropical cyclones
Tropical cyclones are normal disturbances that natural ecosystems 
have been affected by and recovered from for millennia. Climate 
models mostly predict decreasing frequency of tropical cyclones, but 
dramatically increasing intensity of the strongest storms, as well as 
increasing rainfall rates (Bacmeister et al. 2018; Walsh et al. 2016b). 
Large amplitude fluctuations in the frequency and intensity complicate 
both the detection and attribution of tropical cyclones to climate 
change (Lin and Emanuel 2016b). Yet, the force of high-intensity 
cyclones has increased and is expected to escalate further due 
to global climate change (medium agreement, robust evidence) 
(Knutson et al. 2010; Bender et al. 2010; Vecchi et al. 2008; Bhatia 
et al. 2018; Tu et al. 2018; Sobel et al. 2016). Tropical cyclone paths 
are also shifting towards the poles, increasing the area subject to 
tropical cyclones (Sharmila and Walsh 2018; Lin and Emanuel 2016b). 
Climate change alone will affect the hydrology of individual wetland 
ecosystems, mostly through changes in precipitation and temperature 
regimes with great global variability (Erwin 2009). Over the last seven 
decades, the speed at which tropical cyclones move has decreased 
significantly, as expected from theory, exacerbating the damage on 
local communities from increasing rainfall amounts and high wind 
speed (Kossin 2018). Tropical cyclones will accelerate changes in 
coastal forest structure and composition. The heterogeneity of land 
degradation at coasts that are affected by tropical cyclones can be 
further enhanced by the interaction of its components (for example, 
rainfall, wind speed, and direction) with topographic and biological 
factors (for example, species susceptibility) (Luke et al. 2016). 
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are particularly affected by 
land degradation induced by tropical cyclones; recent examples are 
Matthew (2016) in the Caribbean, and Pam (2015) and Winston 
(2016) in the Pacific (Klöck and Nunn 2019; Handmer and Nalau 2019). 
Even if the Pacific Ocean has experienced cyclones of unprecedented 
intensity in recent years, their geomorphological effects may not be 
unprecedented (Terry and Lau 2018).
Cyclone impacts on coastal areas is not restricted to SIDS, but 
a problem for all low-lying coastal areas (Petzold and Magnan 2019). 
The Sundarbans, one of the world’s largest coastal wetlands, covers 
about one million hectares between Bangladesh and India. Large 
areas of the Sundarbans mangroves have been converted into paddy 
fields over the past two centuries and, more recently, into shrimp 
farms (Ghosh et al. 2015). In 2009, cyclone Aila caused incremental 
stresses on the socio-economic conditions of the Sundarbans coastal 
communities through rendering huge areas of land unproductive for 
a long time (Abdullah et al. 2016). The impact of Aila was widespread 
throughout the Sundarbans mangroves, showing changes between the 
pre- and post-cyclonic period of 20–50% in the enhanced vegetation 
index (Dutta et al. 2015), although the magnitude of the effects of the 
Sundarbans mangroves derived from climate change is not yet defined 
(Payo et al. 2016; Loucks et al. 2010; Gopal and Chauhan 2006; Ghosh 
et al. 2015; Chaudhuri et al. 2015). There is high agreement that 
the joint effect of climate change and land degradation will be very 
negative for the area, strongly affecting the environmental services 
provided by these forests, including the extinction of large mammal 
species (Loucks et al. 2010). The changes in vegetation are mainly due 
to inundation and erosion (Payo et al. 2016).
Tropical cyclone Nargis unexpectedly hit the Ayeyarwady River delta 
(Myanmar) in 2008 with unprecedented and catastrophic damages 
to livelihoods, destruction of forests and erosion of fields (Fritz et al. 
2009) as well as eroding the shoreline 148 m compared with the 
long-term average (1974–2015) of 0.62 m yr–1. This is an example of 
the disastrous effects that changing cyclone paths can have on areas 
previously not affected by cyclones (Fritz et al. 2010).
1.9.6.1 
Management of coastal wetlands
Tropical cyclones mainly, but not exclusively, affect coastal regions, 
threatening maintenance of the associated ecosystems, mangroves, 
wetlands, seagrasses, and so on. These areas not only provide food, 
water and shelter for fish, birds and other wildlife, but also provide 
important ecosystem services such as water-quality improvement, 
flood abatement and carbon sequestration (Meng et al. 2017). 
401

Despite their importance, coastal wetlands are listed amongst the 
most heavily damaged of natural ecosystems worldwide. Starting in 
the 1990s, wetland restoration and re-creation became a ‘hotspot’ 
in the ecological research fields (Zedler 2000). Coastal wetland 
restoration and preservation is an extremely cost-effective strategy 
for society, for example, the preservation of coastal wetlands in the 
USA provides storm protection services, with a cost of 23.2 billion 
USD yr–1 (Costanza et al. 2008). 
There is a high agreement with medium evidence that the success 
of wetland restoration depends mainly on the flow of the water 
through the system, the degree to which re-flooding occurs, 
disturbance regimes, and the control of invasive species (Burlakova 
et al. 2009; López-Rosas et al. 2013). The implementation of the 
Ecological Mangrove Rehabilitation protocol (López-Portillo et al. 
2017) that includes monitoring and reporting tasks, has been proven 
to deliver successful rehabilitation of wetland ecosystem services.
1.9.7 
Saltwater intrusion 
Current environmental changes, including climate change, have 
caused sea levels to rise worldwide, particularly in tropical and 
subtropical regions (Fasullo and Nerem 2018). Combined with 
scarcity of water in river channels, such rises have been instrumental 
in the intrusion of highly saline seawater inland, posing a  threat 
to coastal areas and an emerging challenge to land managers and 
policymakers. Assessing the extent of salinisation due to sea water 
intrusion at a global scale nevertheless remains challenging. Wicke 
et al. (2011) suggest that across the world, approximately 1.1 Gha 
of land is affected by salt, with 14% of this categorised as forest, 
wetland or some other form of protected area. Seawater intrusion is 
generally caused by (i) increased tidal activity, storm surges, cyclones 
and sea storms due to changing climate, (ii) heavy groundwater 
extraction or land-use changes as a result of changes in precipitation, 
and droughts/floods, (iii) coastal erosion as a result of destruction of 
mangrove forests and wetlands, (iv) construction of vast irrigation 
canals and drainage networks leading to low river discharge in the 
deltaic region; and (v) sea level rise contaminating nearby freshwater 
aquifers as a result of subsurface intrusion (Uddameri et al. 2014). 
The Indus Delta, located in the south-eastern coast of Pakistan near 
Karachi in the North Arabian Sea, is one of the six largest estuaries in 
the world, spanning an area of 600,000 ha. The Indus delta is a clear 
example of seawater intrusion and land degradation due to local 
as well as up-country climatic and environmental conditions (Rasul 
et al. 2012). Salinisation and waterlogging in the up-country areas 
including provinces of Punjab and Sindh is, however, caused by the 
irrigation network and over-irrigation (Qureshi 2011).
Such degradation takes the form of high soil salinity, inundation and 
waterlogging, erosion and freshwater contamination. The interannual

variability of precipitation with flooding conditions in some years 
and drought conditions in others has caused variable river flows and 
sediment runoff below Kotri Barrage (about 200 km upstream of the 
Indus delta). This has affected hydrological processes in the lower 
reaches of the river and the delta, contributing to the degradation 
(Rasul et al. 2012).
Over 480,000 ha of fertile land is now affected by sea water intrusion, 
wherein eight coastal subdivisions of the districts of Badin and Thatta 
are mostly affected (Chandio et al. 2011). A very high intrusion rate 
of 0.179 ± 0.0315 km yr–1, based on the analysis of satellite data, 
was observed in the Indus delta during the 10 years between 2004 
and 2015 (Kalhoro et al. 2016). The area of agricultural crops under 
cultivation has been declining, with economic losses of millions of 
USD (IUCN 2003). Crop yields have reduced due to soil salinity, in 
some places failing entirely. Soil salinity varies seasonally, depending 
largely on the river discharge: during the wet season (August 2014), 
salinity (0.18 mg L–1) reached 24 km upstream, while during the dry 
season (May 2013), it reached 84 km upstream (Kalhoro et al. 2016). 
The freshwater aquifers have also been contaminated with sea water, 
rendering them unfit for drinking or irrigation purposes. Lack of clean 
drinking water and sanitation causes widespread diseases, of which 
diarrhoea is most common (IUCN 2003).
Lake Urmia in northwest Iran, the second-largest saltwater lake in 
the world and the habitat for endemic Iranian brine shrimp, Artemia 
urmiana, has also been affected by salty water intrusion. During a 17-
year period between 1998 and 2014, human disruption, including 
agriculture and years of dam building affected the natural flow of 
freshwater as well as salty sea water in the surrounding area of Lake 
Urmia. Water quality has also been adversely affected, with salinity 
fluctuating over time, but in recent years reaching a maximum of 
340 g L–1 (similar to levels in the Dead Sea). This has rendered the 
underground water unfit for drinking and agricultural purposes and 
risky to human health and livelihoods. Adverse impacts of global 
climate change as well as direct human impacts have caused changes 
in land use, overuse of underground water resources and construction 
of dams over rivers, which resulted in the drying-up of the lake in 
large part. This condition created sand, dust and salt storms in the 
region which affected many sectors including agriculture, water 
resources, rangelands, forests and health, and generally presented 
desertification conditions around the lake (Karbassi et al. 2010; 
Marjani and Jamali 2014; Shadkam et al. 2016). 
Rapid irrigation expansion in the basin has, however, indirectly 
contributed to inflow reduction. Annual inflow to Lake Urmia has 
dropped by 48% in recent years. About three-fifths of this change 
was caused by climate change and two-fifths by water resource 
development and agriculture (Karbassi et al. 2010; Marjani and 
Jamali 2014; Shadkam et al. 2016).
In the drylands of Mexico, intensive production of irrigated wheat 
and cotton using groundwater (Halvorson et al. 2003) resulted 
in sea water intrusion into the aquifers of La Costa de Hermosillo, 
a  coastal agricultural valley at the centre of Sonora Desert in 
Northwestern Mexico. Production of these crops in 1954 was on 
64,000  ha of cultivated area, increasing to 132,516  ha in 1970, 
but decreasing to 66,044 ha in 2009 as a result of saline intrusion 
from the Gulf of California (Romo-Leon et al. 2014). In 2003, only 
15% of the cultivated area was under production, with around 
80,000  ha abandoned due to soil salinisation whereas in 2009, 
around 40,000 ha was abandoned (Halvorson et al. 2003; Romo-Leon 
et al. 2014). Salinisation of agricultural soils could be exacerbated by 
climate change, as Northwestern Mexico is projected to be warmer 
and drier under climate change scenarios (IPCC 2013a).
In other countries, intrusion of seawater is exacerbated by 
destruction of mangrove forests. Mangroves are important coastal 
ecosystems that provide spawning bed for fish, timber for building, 
and livelihoods to dependent communities. They also act as barriers 
against coastal erosion, storm surges, tropical cyclones and tsunamis 
(Kalhoro et al. 2017) and are among the most carbon-rich stocks 
on Earth (Atwood et al. 2017). They nevertheless face a variety of 
threats: climatic (storm surges, tidal activities, high temperatures) and 
human (coastal developments, pollution, deforestation, conversion 
to aquaculture, rice culture, oil palm plantation), leading to declines 
in their areas. In Pakistan, using remote sensing, the mangrove 
forest cover in the Indus delta decreased from 260,000 ha in 1980s 
to 160,000  ha in 1990 (Chandio et al. 2011). Based on remotely 
sensed data, a sharp decline in the mangrove area was also found 
in the arid coastal region of Hormozgan province in southern Iran 
during 1972, 1987 and 1997 (Etemadi et al. 2016). Myanmar has the 
highest rate (about 1% yr–1) of mangrove deforestation in the world 
(Atwood et al. 2017). Regarding global loss of carbon stored in the 
mangrove due to deforestation, four countries exhibited high levels 
of loss: Indonesia (3410 GgCO2 yr–1), Malaysia (1288 GgCO2 yr–1), US 
(206 GgCO2 yr–1) and Brazil (186 GgCO2 yr–1). Only in Bangladesh 
and Guinea Bissau was there no decline in the mangrove area from 
2000 to 2012 (Atwood et al. 2017).
Frequency and intensity of average tropical cyclones will continue to 
increase (Knutson et al. 2015) and global sea level will continue to 
rise. The IPCC (2013) projected with medium confidence that the sea 
level in the Asia Pacific region will rise from 0.4 to 0.6 m, depending 
on the emission pathway, by the end of this century. Adaptation 
measures are urgently required to protect the world’s coastal areas 
from further degradation due to saline intrusion. A  viable policy 
framework is needed to ensure that the environmental flows to 
deltas in order to repulse the intruding seawater.
1.9.8 
Avoiding coastal maladaptation 
Coastal degradation – for example, beach erosion, coastal squeeze, 
and coastal biodiversity loss – as a result of rising sea levels is a major 
concern for low lying coasts and small islands (high confidence). The 
contribution of climate change to increased coastal degradation has 
been well documented in AR5 (Nurse et al. 2014; Wong et al. 2014) 
and is further discussed in Section  4.4.1.3 as well as in the IPCC 
Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate 
(SROCC). However, coastal degradation can also be indirectly induced 
by climate change as the result of adaptation measures that involve 
changes to the coastal environment, for example, coastal protection 
measures against increased flooding and erosion due to sea level 
403

rise, and storm surges transforming the natural coast to a ‘stabilised’ 
coastline (Cooper and Pile 2014; French 2001). Every kind of adaptation 
response option is context-dependent, and, in fact, sea walls play an 
important role for adaptation in many places. Nonetheless, there are 
observed cases where the construction of sea walls can be considered 
‘maladaptation’ (Barnett and O’Neill 2010; Magnan et al. 2016) by 
leading to increased coastal degradation, such as in the case of small 
islands where, due to limitations of space, coastal retreat is less of an 
option than in continental coastal zones. There is emerging literature 
on the implementation of alternative coastal protection measures and 
mechanisms on small islands to avoid coastal degradation induced by 
sea walls (e.g., Mycoo and Chadwick 2012; Sovacool 2012).
In many cases, increased rates of coastal erosion due to the 
construction of sea walls are the result of the negligence of local 
coastal morphological dynamics and natural variability as well as 
the interplay of environmental and anthropogenic drivers of coastal 
change (medium evidence, high agreement). Sea walls in response 
to coastal erosion may be ill-suited for extreme wave heights under 
cyclone impacts and can lead to coastal degradation by keeping 
overflowing sea water from flowing back into the sea, and therefore 
affect the coastal vegetation through saltwater intrusion, as observed 
in Tuvalu (Government of Tuvalu 2006; Wairiu 2017). Similarly, in 
Kiribati, poor construction of sea walls has resulted in increased 
erosion and inundation of reclaimed land (Donner 2012; Donner 
and Webber 2014). In the Comoros and Tuvalu, sea walls have been 
constructed from climate change adaptation funds and ‘often by 
international development organisations seeking to leave tangible 
evidence of their investments’ (Marino and Lazrus 2015, p. 344). In 
these cases, they have even increased coastal erosion, due to poor 
planning and the negligence of other causes of coastal degradation, 
such as sand mining (Marino and Lazrus 2015; Betzold and Mohamed 
2017; Ratter et al. 2016). On the Bahamas, the installation of sea walls 
as a response to coastal erosion in areas with high wave action has 
led to the contrary effect and has even increased sand loss in those 
areas (Sealey 2006). The reduction of natural buffer zones – such as 
beaches and dunes – due to vertical structures, such as sea walls, 
increased the impacts of tropical cyclones on Reunion Island (Duvat 
et al. 2016). Such a process of ‘coastal squeeze’ (Pontee 2013) also 
results in the reduction of intertidal habitat zones, such as wetlands 
and marshes (Zhu et al. 2010). Coastal degradation resulting from the 
construction of sea walls, however, is not only observed in SIDS, as 
described above, but also on islands in the Global North, for example, 
the North Atlantic (Muir et al. 2014; Young et al. 2014; Cooper and 
Pile 2014; Bush 2004).
The adverse effects of coastal protection measures may be avoided 
by the consideration of local social-ecological dynamics, including 
critical study of the diverse drivers of ongoing shoreline changes, 
and the appropriate implementation of locally adequate coastal 
protection options (French 2001; Duvat 2013). Critical elements for 
avoiding maladaptation include profound knowledge of local tidal 
regimes, availability of relative sea level rise scenarios and projections 
for extreme water levels. Moreover, the downdrift effects of sea walls 
need to be considered, since undefended coasts may be exposed to 
increased erosion (Zhu et al. 2010). In some cases, it may be possible 
to keep intact and restore natural buffer zones as an alternative to the 
construction of hard engineering solutions. Otherwise, changes in land 
use, building codes, or even coastal realignment can be an option in 
order to protect and avoid the loss of the buffer function of beaches 
(Duvat et al. 2016; Cooper and Pile 2014). Examples in Barbados show 
that combinations of hard and soft coastal protection approaches can 
be sustainable and reduce the risk of coastal ecosystem degradation 
while keeping the desired level of protection for coastal users (Mycoo 
and Chadwick 2012). Nature-based solutions and approaches 
such as ‘building with nature’ (Slobbe et al. 2013) may allow for 
more sustainable coastal protection mechanisms and avoid coastal 
degradation. Examples from the Maldives, several Pacific islands and 
the North Atlantic show the importance of the involvement of local 
communities in coastal adaptation projects, considering local skills, 
capacities, as well as demographic and socio-political dynamics, in 
order to ensure the proper monitoring and maintenance of coastal 
adaptation measures (Sovacool 2012; Muir et al. 2014; Young et al. 
2014; Buggy and McNamara 2016; Petzold 2016).

Knowledge gaps and key uncertainties 
The co-benefits of improved land management, such as mitigation 
of climate change, increased climate resilience of agriculture, and 
impacts on rural areas/societies are well known in theory, but there 
is a  lack of a  coherent and systematic global inventory of such 
integrated efforts. Both successes and failures are important to 
document systematically. 
Efforts to reduce climate change through land-demanding mitigation 
actions aimed at removing atmospheric carbon, such as afforestation, 
reforestation, bioenergy crops, intensification of land management 
and plantation forestry can adversely affect land conditions and lead 
to degradation. However, they may also lead to avoidance, reduction 
and reversal of degradation. Regionally differentiated, socially 
and ecologically appropriate SLM strategies need to be identified, 
implemented, monitored and the results communicated widely to 
ensure climate effective outcomes.
Impacts of new technologies on land degradation and their social 
and economic ramifications need more research. 
Improved quantification of the global extent, severity and rates of 
land degradation by combining remote sensing with a systematic 
use of ancillary data is a priority. The current attempts need better 
scientific underpinning and appropriate funding. 
Land degradation is defined using multiple criteria but the definition 
does not provide thresholds or the magnitude of acceptable change. 
In practice, human interactions with land will result in a  variety 
of changes; some may contribute positively to one criterion while 
adversely affecting another. Research is required on the magnitude 
of impacts and the resulting trade-offs. Given the urgent need to 
remove carbon from the atmosphere and to reduce climate change 
impacts, it is important to reach agreement on what level of reduction 
in one criterion (biological productivity, ecological integrity) may 
be acceptable for a given increase in another criterion (ecological 
integrity, biological productivity).

Attribution of land degradation to the underlying drivers is 
a challenge because it is a complex web of causality rather than 
a  simple cause–effect relationship. Also, diverging views on land 
degradation in relation to other challenges is hampering such efforts. 
A more systematic treatment of the views and experiences of land 
users would be useful in land degradation studies. 
Much research has tried to understand how social and ecological 
systems are affected by a particular stressor, for example, drought, 
heat, or waterlogging. But less research has tried to understand how 
such systems are affected by several simultaneous stressors – which 
is more realistic in the context of climate change (Mittler 2006). 
More realistic modelling of carbon dynamics, including better 
appreciation of below-ground biota, would help us to better quantify 
the role of soils and soil management for soil carbon sequestration. 
Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 4.1 | 
How do climate change and land degradation interact with land use?
Climate change, land degradation and land use are linked in a complex web of causality. One important impact of climate change 
on land degradation is that increasing global temperatures intensify the hydrological cycle, resulting in more intense rainfall, which 
is an important driver of soil erosion. This means that sustainable land management (SLM) becomes even more important with 
climate change. Land-use change in the form of clearing of forest for rangeland and cropland (e.g., for provision of bio-fuels), and 
cultivation of peat soils, is a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from both biomass and soils. Many SLM practices 
(e.g., agroforestry, perennial crops, organic amendments, etc.) increase carbon content of soil and vegetation cover and hence 
provide both local and immediate adaptation benefits, combined with global mitigation benefits in the long term, while providing 
many social and economic co-benefits. Avoiding, reducing and reversing land degradation has a large potential to mitigate climate 
change and help communities to adapt to climate change. 
FAQ 4.2 | 
 How does climate change affect land-related ecosystem  
services and biodiversity?
Climate change will affect land-related ecosystem services (e.g., pollination, resilience to extreme climate events, water yield, soil 
conservation, carbon storage, etc.) and biodiversity, both directly and indirectly. The direct impacts range from subtle reductions or 
enhancements of specific services, such as biological productivity, resulting from changes in temperature, temperature variability 
or rainfall, to complete disruption and elimination of services. Disruptions of ecosystem services can occur where climate change 
causes transitions from one biome to another, for example, forest to grassland as a result of changes in water balance or natural 
disturbance regimes. Climate change will result in range shifts and, in some cases, extinction of species. Climate change can 
also alter the mix of land-related ecosystem services, such as groundwater recharge, purification of water, and flood protection. 
While the net impacts are specific to time as well as ecosystem types and services, there is an asymmetry of risk such that overall 
impacts of climate change are expected to reduce ecosystem services. Indirect impacts of climate change on land-related ecosystem 
services include those that result from changes in human behaviour, including potential large-scale human migrations or the 
implementation of afforestation, reforestation or other changes in land management, which can have positive or negative outcomes 
on ecosystem services.
