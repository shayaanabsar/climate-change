2 GENERIC METHODOLOGIES APPLICABLE 
TO MULTIPLE LAND-USE CATEGORIES 
2.1 
INTRODUCTION  
Methods to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
(AFOLU) Sector can be divided into two broad categories: 1) methods that can be applied in a similar way for 
any of the types of land use (i.e., generic methods for Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements 
and Other Land); and 2) methods that only apply to a single land use or that are applied to aggregate data on a 
national-level, without specifying land use.  Chapter 2 provides mainly descriptions of generic methodologies 
under category (1) for estimating ecosystem carbon stock changes as well as for estimating non-CO2 fluxes from 
fire. These methods can be applied for any of the six land-use categories. Generic information on methods 
includes: 
• 
general framework for applying the methods within specific land-use categories; 
• 
choice of methods, including equations and default values for Tier 1 methods for estimating C stock changes 
and non-CO2 emissions;  
• 
general guidance on use of higher Tier methods; 
• 
use of the IPCC Emission Factor Data Base (EFDB); and 
• 
uncertainty estimation.    
Specific details and guidance on implementing the methods for each of the land-use and land-use conversion 
categories, including choosing emission factors, compiling activity data and assessing uncertainty, are given in 
the chapters on specific land-use categories (see Chapters 4 to 9).  Guidance on inventory calculations for each 
specific land use refers back to this chapter for description of methods where they are generic. 
2.2 
INVENTORY FRAMEWORK  
This section outlines a systematic approach for estimating carbon stock changes (and associated emissions and 
removals of CO2) from biomass, dead organic matter, and soils, as well as for estimating non-CO2 greenhouse 
gas emissions from fire.  General equations representing the level of land-use categories and strata are followed 
by a short description of processes with more detailed equations for carbon stock changes in specific pools by 
land-use category. Principles for estimating non-CO2 emissions and common equations are then given. Specific, 
operational equations to estimate emissions and removals by processes within a pool and by category, which 
directly correspond to worksheet calculations, are provided in Sections 2.3 and 2.4.   
2.2.1 
Overview of carbon stock change estimation  
The emissions and removals of CO2 for the AFOLU Sector, based on changes in ecosystem C stocks, are 
estimated for each land-use category (including both land remaining in a land-use category as well as land 
converted to another land use). Carbon stock changes are summarized by Equation 2.1.

For each land-use category, carbon stock changes are estimated for all strata or subdivisions of land area (e.g., 
climate zone, ecotype, soil type, management regime etc., see Chapter 3) chosen for a land-use category 
(Equation 2.2).  Carbon stock changes within a stratum are estimated by considering carbon cycle processes 
between the five carbon pools, as defined in Table 1.1 in Chapter 1. The generalized flowchart of the carbon 
cycle (Figure 2.1) shows all five pools and associated fluxes including inputs to and outputs from the system, as 
well as all possible transfers between the pools. Overall, carbon stock changes within a stratum are estimated by 
adding up changes in all pools as in Equation 2.3.  Further, carbon stock changes in soil may be disaggregated as 
to changes in C stocks in mineral soils and emissions from organic soils. Harvested wood products (HWP) are 
also included as an additional pool.

Estimating changes in carbon pools and fluxes depends on data and model availability, as well as resources and 
capacity to collect and analyze additional information (See Chapter 1, Section 1.3.3 on key category analysis).  
Table 1.1 in Chapter 1 outlines which pools are relevant for each land-use category for Tier 1 methods, including 
cross references to reporting tables.  Depending on country circumstances and which tiers are chosen, stock 
changes may not be estimated for all pools shown in Equation 2.3.  Because of limitations to deriving default 
data sets to support estimation of some stock changes, Tier 1 methods include several simplifying assumptions:

• 
change in below-ground biomass C stocks are assumed to be zero under Tier 1 (under Tier 2, country-
specific data on ratios of below-ground to above-ground biomass can be used to estimate below-ground 
stock changes); 
• 
under Tier 1, dead wood and litter pools are often lumped together as ‘dead organic matter’ (see discussion 
below); and 
• 
dead organic matter stocks are assumed to be zero for non-forest land-use categories under Tier 1. For 
Forest Land converted to another land use, default values for estimating dead organic matter carbon stocks 
are provided in Tier 1.  
The carbon cycle includes changes in carbon stocks due to both continuous processes (i.e., growth, decay) and 
discrete events (i.e., disturbances like harvest, fire, insect outbreaks, land-use change and other events). 
Continuous processes can affect carbon stocks in all areas in each year, while discrete events (i.e., disturbances) 
cause emissions and redistribute ecosystem carbon in specific areas (i.e., where the disturbance occurs) and in 
the year of the event.  
Disturbances may also have long-lasting effects, such as decay of wind-blown or burnt trees. For practicality,  
Tier 1 methods assume that all post-disturbance emissions (less removal of harvested wood products) are 
estimated as part of the disturbance event, i.e., in the year of the disturbance. For example, rather than estimating 
the decay of dead organic matter left after a disturbance over a period of several years, all post-disturbance 
emissions are estimated in the year of the event.   
Under Tier 1, it is assumed that the average transfer rate into dead organic matter (dead wood and litter) is equal 
to the average transfer rate out of dead organic matter, so that the net stock change is zero. This assumption 
means that dead organic matter (dead wood and litter) carbon stocks need not be quantified under Tier 1 for land 
areas that remain in a land-use category1. The rationale for this approach is that dead organic matter stocks, 
particularly dead wood, are highly variable and site-specific, depending on forest type and age, disturbance 
history and management.  In addition, data on coarse woody debris decomposition rates are scarce and thus it 
was deemed that globally applicable default factors and uncertainty estimates can not be developed.  Countries 
experiencing significant changes in forest types or disturbance or management regimes in their forests are 
encouraged to develop domestic data to estimate the impact from these changes using Tier 2 or 3 methodologies 
and to report the resulting carbon stock changes and non-CO2 emissions and removals.  
All estimates of changes in carbon stocks, i.e., growth, internal transfers and emissions, are in units of carbon to 
make all calculations consistent. Data on biomass stocks, increments, harvests, etc. can initially be in units of dry 
matter that need to be converted to tonnes of carbon for all subsequent calculations. There are two fundamentally 
different and equally valid approaches to estimating stock changes: 1) the process-based approach, which 
estimates the net balance of additions to and removals from a carbon stock; and 2) the stock-based approach, 
which estimates the difference in carbon stocks at two points in time. 
Annual carbon stock changes in any pool can be estimated using the process-based approach in Equation 2.4 
which sets out the Gain-Loss Method that can be applied to all carbon gains or losses. Gains can be attributed to 
growth (increase of biomass) and to transfer of carbon from another pool (e.g., transfer of carbon from the live 
biomass carbon pool to the dead organic matter pool due to harvest or natural disturbances). Gains are always 
marked with a positive (+) sign. Losses can be attributed to transfers of carbon from one pool to another (e.g., 
the carbon in the slash during a harvesting operation is a loss from the above-ground biomass pool), or emissions 
due to decay, harvest, burning, etc. Losses are always marked with a negative (-) sign.

ΔCL  = annual loss of carbon, tonnes C yr-1 
Note that CO2 removals are transfers from the atmosphere to a pool, whereas CO2 emissions are transfers from a 
pool to the atmosphere.  Not all transfers involve emissions or removals, since any transfer from one pool to 
another is a loss from the donor pool, but is a gain of equal amount to the receiving pool. For example, a transfer 
from the above-ground biomass pool to the dead wood pool is a loss from the above-ground biomass pool and a 
gain of equal size for the dead wood pool, which does not necessarily result in immediate CO2 emission to the 
atmosphere (depending on the Tier used).  
The method used in Equation 2.4 is called the Gain-Loss Method, because it includes all processes that bring 
about changes in a pool. An alternative stock-based approach is termed the Stock-Difference Method, which can 
be used where carbon stocks in relevant pools are measured at two points in time to assess carbon stock changes, 
as represented in Equation 2.5.

Ct2 = carbon stock in the pool at time t2, tonnes C 
If the C stock changes are estimated on a per hectare basis, then the value is multiplied by the total area within 
each stratum to obtain the total stock change estimate for the pool.  In some cases, the activity data may be in the 
form of country totals (e.g., harvested wood) in which case the stock change estimates for that pool are estimated 
directly from the activity data after applying appropriate factors to convert to units of C mass. When using the 
Stock-Difference Method for a specific land-use category, it is important to ensure that the area of land in that 
category at times t1 and t2 is identical, to avoid confounding stock change estimates with area changes. 
The process method lends itself to modelling approaches using coefficients derived from empirical research data. 
These will smooth out inter-annual variability to a greater extent than the stock change method which relies on 
the difference of stock estimates at two points in time. Both methods are valid so long as they are capable of 
representing actual disturbances as well as continuously varying trends, and can be verified by comparison with 
actual measurements. 
2.2.2 
Overview of non-CO2 emission estimation  
Non-CO2 emissions are derived from a variety of sources, including emissions from soils, livestock and manure, 
and from combustion of biomass, dead wood and litter.  In contrast to the way CO2 emissions are estimated from 
biomass stock changes, the estimate of non-CO2 greenhouse gases usually involves an emission rate from a 
source directly to the atmosphere.  The rate (Equation 2.6) is generally determined by an emission factor for a 
specific gas (e.g., CH4, N2O) and source category and an area (e.g., for soil or area burnt), population (e.g., for 
livestock) or mass (e.g., for biomass or manure) that defines the emission source.

2.11 
Many of the emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases are either associated with a specific land use (e.g., CH4 
emissions from rice) or are typically estimated from national-level aggregate data (e.g., CH4 emissions from 
livestock and N2O emissions from managed soils).  Where an emission source is associated with a single land 
use, the methodology for that emission is described in the chapter for that specific land-use category (e.g., 
methane from rice in Chapter 5 on Cropland).  Emissions that are generally based on aggregated data are dealt 
with in separate chapters (e.g., Chapter 10 on livestock-related emissions, and Chapter 11 on N2O emissions 
from managed soils and CO2 emissions from liming and urea applications). This chapter describes only methods 
to estimate non-CO2 (and CO2) emissions from biomass combustion, which can occur in several different land-
use categories. 
2.2.3 
Conversion of C stock changes to CO2 emissions 
For reporting purposes, changes in C stock categories (that involve transfers to the atmosphere) can be converted 
to units of CO2 emissions by multiplying the C stock change by -44/12. In cases where a significant amount of 
the carbon stock change is through emissions of CO and CH4, then these non-CO2 carbon emissions should be 
subtracted from the estimated CO2 emissions or removals using methods provided for the estimation of these 
gases. In making these estimates, inventory compilers should assess each category to ensure that this carbon is 
not already covered by the assumptions and approximations made in estimating CO2 emissions. 
It should also be noted that not every stock change corresponds to an emission. The conversion to CO2 from C, is 
based on the ratio of molecular weights (44/12). The change of sign (-) is due to the convention that increases in 
C stocks, i.e. positive (+) stock changes, represent a removal (or ‘negative’ emission) from the atmosphere, 
while decreases in C stocks, i.e. negative (-) stock changes, represent a positive emission to the atmosphere.  
2.3 
GENERIC METHODS FOR CO2 EMISSIONS 
AND REMOVALS  
As outlined in Section 2.2, emissions and removals of CO2 within the AFOLU Sector are generally estimated on 
the basis of changes in ecosystem carbon stocks. These consist of above-ground and below-ground biomass, 
dead organic matter (i.e., dead wood and litter), and soil organic matter. Net losses in total ecosystem carbon 
stocks are used to estimate CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, and net gains in total ecosystem carbon stocks are 
used to estimate removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Inter-pool transfers may be taken into account where 
appropriate.  Changes in carbon stocks may be estimated by direct inventory methods or by process models. 
Each of the C stocks or pools can occur in any of land-use categories, hence general attributes of the methods 
that apply to any land-use category are described here. In particular cases, losses in carbon stocks or pools may 
imply emissions of non-CO2 gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, non-methane volatile organic carbon and 
others. The methods for estimating emissions of these gases are provided in Section 2.4. It is good practice to 
check for complete coverage of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions due to losses in carbon stocks or pools to avoid 
omissions or double counting. Specific details regarding the application of these methods within a particular 
land-use category are provided under the relevant land uses in Chapters 4 to 9. 
2.3.1 
Change in biomass carbon stocks (above-ground 
biomass and below-ground biomass) 
Plant biomass constitutes a significant carbon stock in many ecosystems.  Biomass is present in both above-
ground and below-ground parts of annual and perennial plants. Biomass associated with annual and perennial 
herbaceous (i.e., non-woody) plants is relatively ephemeral, i.e., it decays and regenerates annually or every few 
years. So emissions from decay are balanced by removals due to re-growth making overall net C stocks in 
biomass rather stable in the long term.  Thus, the methods focus on stock changes in biomass associated with 
woody plants and trees, which can accumulate large amounts of carbon (up to hundreds of tonnes per ha) over 
their lifespan. Carbon stock change in biomass on Forest Land is likely to be an important sub-category because 
of substantial fluxes owing to management and harvest, natural disturbances, natural mortality and forest re-
growth.  In addition, land-use conversions from Forest Land to other land uses often result in substantial loss of 
carbon from the biomass pool.  Trees and woody plants can occur in any of the six land-use categories although 
biomass stocks are generally largest on Forest Land.  For inventory purposes, changes in C stock in biomass are 
estimated for (i) land remaining in the same land-use category and (ii) land converted to a new land-use category. 
The reporting convention is that all emissions and removals associated with a land-use change are reported in the 
new land-use category.

2.3.1.1 
LAND REMAINING IN A LAND-USE CATEGORY 
Equation 2.3 includes the five carbon pools for which stock change estimates are required. This section presents 
methods for estimating biomass carbon gains, losses and net changes. Gains include biomass growth in above-
ground and below-ground components. Losses are categorized into wood fellings or harvest, fuelwood gathering, 
and losses from natural disturbances on managed land such as fire, insect outbreaks and extreme weather events 
(e.g., hurricanes, flooding). Two methods are provided for estimating carbon stock changes in biomass.  
The Gain-Loss Method requires the biomass carbon loss to be subtracted from the biomass carbon gain 
(Equation 2.7). This underpins the Tier 1 method, for which default values for calculation of increment and 
losses are provided in this Volume to estimate stock changes in biomass. Higher tier methods use country-
specific data to estimate gain and loss rates. For all tiers, these estimates require country-specific activity data, 
although for Tier 1, these data can be obtained from globally-compiled databases (e.g., FAO statistics).

the total area, tonnes C yr-1 
∆CL = annual decrease in carbon stocks due to biomass loss for each land sub-category, considering the

The changes in C stock in biomass for land remaining in the same land-use category (e.g., Forest Land 
Remaining Forest Land) are based on estimates of annual gain and loss in biomass stocks. Countries using any 
of the three tiers can adopt this method. This method can be used by countries that do not have national 
inventory systems designed for estimating woody biomass stocks. Default data are provided in land-use category 
chapters for inventory compilers who do not have access to country-specific data. Worksheets have also been 
developed using the methods and equations (Annex 1).  
The Stock-Difference Method requires biomass carbon stock inventories for a given land area, at two points in 
time. Annual biomass change is the difference between the biomass stock at time t2 and time t1, divided by the 
number of years between the inventories (Equation 2.8).  In some cases, primary data on biomass may be in the 
form of wood volume data, for example, from forest surveys, in which case factors are provided to convert wood 
volume to carbon mass units, as shown in Equation 2.8.b.

ground biomass. BCEFS values are more convenient because they can be applied directly to volume-
based forest inventory data and operational records, without the need of having to resort to basic 
wood densities (D). They provide best results, when they have been derived locally and based 
directly on merchantable volume.  However, if BCEFS values are not available and if the biomass 
expansion factor (BEFS) and D values are separately estimated, the following conversion can be used: 
BCEFS = BEFS ● D 
In applying the Gain-Loss or Stock-Difference Methods, the relevant area is clearly the area of land remaining in 
the relevant category at the end of the year for which the inventory is being estimated. Any other land will be in 
a conversion category (see Section 2.3.1.2). The length of time that land remains in a conversion category after a 
change in land use is by default 20 years (the time period assumed for carbon stocks to come to equilibrium for 
the purposes of calculating default coefficients in the 1996 IPCC Guidelines and retained for GPG-LULUCF and 
used here also, though other periods may be used at higher Tiers according to national circumstances). Under 
default assumptions therefore land will be transferred from a conversion category to a remaining category after it 
has been in a given land use for 20 years. Some carbon stock changes will take place in the year of conversion, 
but nevertheless it is important to be consistent about the period for which land stays in the conversion category 
or the approaches to land area estimation described in the next Chapter will not work. Stock changes that are 
completed within 1 year after conversion will be related to the area converted annually and the relevant land 
areas may need to be treated as a sub-category within the conversion category but nevertheless should remain in 
the conversion category until the 20 year default or other conversion time period is completed. 
The Stock-Difference Method will be applicable in countries that have national inventory systems for forests and 
other land-use categories, where the stocks of different biomass pools are measured at periodic intervals. The 
stock-difference method requires greater resources and many countries may not have national inventory systems 
for forests and other land-use categories. This method is suitable to countries adopting a Tier 3 and in some cases 
a Tier 2 approach, but may not be suitable for countries using a Tier 1 approach due to limitations of data. It is 
important to make sure that inventory system generates data on gains and losses of biomass carbon pools.  
Either of the above two methods can be used for estimating biomass carbon stock changes for all land categories 
(e.g., Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, Grassland Remaining Grassland, and Cropland Remaining 
Cropland) where perennial woody biomass may be present. Figure 2.2 can be used to assist inventory agencies 
in identifying the appropriate tier to estimate changes in biomass carbon stocks. 
Note that some biomass losses can lead to emissions of C other than as CO2, such as biomass consumption and 
emission as methane (CH4) by termites and wild mammals.2  Default Tier 1 methods for these sources have not 
been developed, and countries wishing to estimate and report these emissions should develop and employ a Tier 
3 approach.

METHODS FOR ESTIMATING CHANGE IN CARBON STOCKS IN 
BIOMASS (∆CB)  
A.1 
Estimating annual increase in biomass carbon stocks (Gain-Loss Method), 
∆CG  
This is the Tier 1 method that, when combined with default biomass growth rates, allows for any country to 
calculate the annual increase in biomass, using estimates of area and mean annual biomass increment, for each 
land-use type and stratum (e.g., climatic zone, ecological zone, vegetation type) (Equation 2.9).

GTOTAL is the total biomass growth expanded from the above-ground biomass growth (Gw) to include below-
ground biomass growth.  Following a Tier 1 method, this may be achieved directly by using default values of GW 
for naturally regenerated trees or broad categories of plantations together with R, the ratio of below-ground 
biomass to above-ground biomass differentiated by woody vegetation type. In Tiers 2 and 3, the net annual 
increment (IV) can be used with either basic wood density (D) and biomass expansion factor (BEFI) or directly 
with biomass conversion and expansion factor (BCEFI) for conversion of annual net increment to above-ground 
biomass increment for each vegetation type. Equation 2.10 shows the relationships.

available and if the biomass expansion factor (BEF) and basic wood density (D) values are separately 
estimated, then the following conversion can be used: 
BCEFI  = BEFI  ●  D 
Biomass Expansion Factors (BEFI) 3 expand merchantable volume to total above-ground biomass volume to 
account for non-merchantable components of increment. BEFI is dimensionless.  
Estimates for BCEFI for woody (perennial) biomass on non-forest lands such as Grassland (savanna), Cropland 
(agro-forestry), orchards, coffee, tea, and rubber may not be readily available. In this case, default values of 
BCEFI from one of the forest types closest to the non-forest vegetation can be used to convert merchantable 
biomass to total biomass. BCEFI is relevant only to perennial woody tree biomass for which merchantable 
biomass data are available. For perennial shrubs, grasses and crops, biomass increment data in terms of tonnes of 
dry matter per hectare may be directly available and in this case use of Equation 2.10 will not be required.  
 
 
A.2 
Estimating annual decrease in biomass carbon stocks due to losses (Gain-
Loss Method), ∆CL 
Loss estimates are needed for calculating biomass carbon stock change using the Gain-Loss Method. Note that 
the loss estimate is also needed when using the Stock–Difference Method to estimate the transfers of biomass to 
dead organic matter when higher Tier estimation methods are used (see below).  Annual biomass loss is the sum 
of losses from wood removal (harvest), fuelwood removal (not counting fuelwood gathered from woody debris), 
and other losses resulting from disturbances, such as fire, storms, and insect and diseases. The relationship is 
shown in Equation 2.11.

Lfuelwood    = annual biomass carbon loss due to fuelwood removals, tonnes C yr-1 (See Equation 2.13) 
Ldisturbance   = annual biomass carbon losses due to disturbances, tonnes C yr-1 (See Equation 2.14) 
Equation 2.11 and the following Equations 2.12 to 2.14 are directly applicable to Forest Land. These Equations 
(2.11 to 2.14) can also be used for estimating losses from Cropland and Grassland, if quantities of wood removal 
(harvesting), fuelwood removal, and loss due to disturbance are available for perennial woody biomass. In 
intensively managed as well as highly degraded croplands and grasslands, the perennial woody biomass loss is 
likely to be small. Default biomass carbon loss values for woody crop species are provided for the Tier 1 
cropland methodology (see Table 5.1).  It is important to note that wood-removal used in Equation 2.11 should 
be compared with the input to HWP in Chapter 12 for consistency. 
The three terms on the right hand side of Equation 2.11 are obtained as follows: 
Loss of biomass and carbon from wood removal (harvesting), Lwood -rem ovals 
The method for estimating the annual biomass carbon loss due to wood-removals is provided in Equation 2.12. 
                                                           
3 In some applications, BEFs are used to expand dry-weight of merchantable components or stem biomass to total biomass, 
excluding or including roots, or convert and expand merchantable or stem volume to above-ground or total biomass 
(Somogyi et al., 2006). As used in this document, biomass expansion factors always transform dry-weight of merchantable 
components including bark to aboveground biomass, excluding roots.

following conversion can be used: 
BCEFR  = BEFR ●  D 
If country-specific data on roundwood removals are not available, the inventory experts should use FAO 
statistics on wood harvest. FAO statistical data on wood harvest exclude bark. To convert FAO statistical wood 
harvest data without bark into merchantable wood removals including bark, multiply by default expansion factor 
of 1.15.  
 
Loss of biomass and carbon from fuelwood removal, Lfuelwood 
Fuelwood removal will often be comprised of two components. First, removal for fuelwood of living trees and 
parts of trees such as tops and branches, where the tree itself remains in the forest, will reduce the carbon in the 
biomass of growing stock and should be treated as biomass carbon loss. The second component is gathering of 
dead wood and logging slash. This will reduce the dead organic matter carbon pool. If it is possible it is good 
practice to estimate the two components separately.  The biomass carbon loss due to fuelwood removal of live 
trees is estimated using Equation 2.13.

removals (BEFR) and basic wood density (D) values are separately estimated, then the following 
conversion can be used: 
BCEFR  = BEFR ●  D 
Biomass Expansion Factors (BEFR) expand merchantable wood removals to total aboveground biomass volume 
to account for non-merchantable components of the tree, stand and forest. BEFR is dimensionless. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.18 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
If country-specific data on roundwood removals are not available, the inventory experts should use FAO 
statistics on wood harvest. It should be noted that FAO statistical data on wood harvest exclude bark. To convert 
FAO statistical wood harvest data without bark into merchantable wood removals including bark, multiply by 
default expansion factor of 1.15.  
Wood harvest can comprise both wood and fuelwood removals (i.e., wood removals in Equation 2.12 can 
include both wood and fuelwood removal), or fuelwood removals can be reported separately using, both 
Equations 2.12 and 2.13. To avoid double counting, it is good practice to check how fuelwood data are 
represented in the country and to use the equation that is most appropriate for national conditions.  Furthermore, 
the wood harvest from forests becomes an input to HWP (Chapter 12). Therefore, it is good practice to check for 
consistent representation of wood-harvest data in Equations 2.12 and 2.13 and those in Chapter 12. 
Loss of biomass and carbon from disturbance, Ldisturbance 
A generic approach for estimating the amount of carbon lost from disturbances is provided in Equation 2.14. In 
the specific case of losses from fire on managed land, including wildfires and controlled fires, this method 
should be used to provide input to the methodology to estimate CO2 and non-CO2 emissions from fires.

CF = carbon fraction of dry matter, tonne C (tonnes d.m.)-1 
fd = fraction of biomass lost in disturbance (see note below)  
Note: The parameter fd defines the proportion of biomass that is lost from the biomass pool: a stand-
replacing disturbance will kill all (fd = 1) biomass while an insect disturbance may only remove a 
portion (e.g. fd = 0.3) of the average biomass C density. Equation 2.14 does not specify the fate of 
the carbon removed from the biomass carbon stock. The Tier 1 assumption is that all of Ldisturbances is 
emitted in the year of disturbance. Higher Tier methods assume that some of this carbon is emitted 
immediately and some is added to the dead organic matter pools (dead wood, litter) or HWP. 
The amounts of biomass carbon transferred to different fates can be defined using a disturbance matrix that can 
be parameterized to define the impacts of different disturbance types (Kurz et al., 1992). It is good practice, if 
possible, to develop and use a disturbance matrix (Table 2.1) for each biomass, dead organic matter and soil 
carbon pool, the proportion of the carbon remaining in that pool, and the proportions transferred to other pools, 
to harvested wood products and to the atmosphere, during the disturbance event. The proportions in each row 
always sum to 1 to ensure conservation of carbon.  The value entered in cell A is the proportion of above-ground 
biomass remaining after a disturbance (or 1 – fd, where fd is defined in Equation 2.14). The Tier 1 assumption is 
that all of fd is emitted in the year of disturbance: therefore the value entered in cell F is fd. For higher Tiers, 
only the proportion emitted in the year is entered in cell F and the remainder is added to cells B and C in the case 
of fire, and B, C, and E in the case of harvest. It is good practice to develop disturbance matrix even under Tier 1 
to ensure that all carbon pool transfers are considered, though all biomass carbon is assumed to be emitted in the 
year of land conversion. It is important to note that some of the transfers could be small or insignificant.

2.3.1.2 
LAND CONVERTED TO A NEW LAND-USE CATEGORY  
The methods for estimation of emissions and removals of carbon resulting from land-use conversion from one 
land-use category to another are presented in this section. Possible conversions include conversion from non-
forest to Forest Land, Cropland and Forest Land to Grassland, and Grassland and Forest Land to Cropland. 
The CO2 emissions and removals on land converted to a new land-use category include annual changes in carbon 
stocks in above-ground and below-ground biomass.  Annual carbon stock changes for each of these pools can be 
estimated by using Equation 2.4 (ΔCB = ∆CG - ∆CL), where ∆CG is the annual gain in carbon, and ∆CL is the 
annual loss of carbon. ΔCB can be estimated separately for each land use (e.g., Forest Land, Cropland, 
Grassland) and management category (e.g., natural forest, plantation), by specific strata (e.g., climate or forest 
type).  
METHODS FOR ESTIMATING CHANGE IN CARBON STOCKS IN BIOMASS 
(∆CB)  
i) Annual increase in carbon stocks in biomass, ∆CG 
Tier 1: Annual increase in carbon stocks in biomass due to land converted to another land-use category can be 
estimated using Equation 2.9 described above for lands remaining in a category. Tier 1 employs a default 
assumption that there is no change in initial biomass carbon stocks due to conversion. This assumption can be 
applied if the data on previous land uses are not available, which may be the case when land area totals are 
estimated using Approach 1 or 2 described in Chapter 3 (non-spatially explicit land area data). This approach 
implies the use of default parameters in Section 4.5 (Chapter 4).  The area of land converted can be categorized 
based on management practices e.g., intensively managed plantations and grasslands or extensively managed 
(low input) plantations, grasslands or abandoned croplands that revert back to forest and should be kept in 
conversion category for 20 years or another time interval.  If the previous land use on a converted area is known, 
then the Tier 2 method described below can be used. 
ii) Annual decrease in carbon stocks in biomass due to losses, ∆CL 
Tier 1: The annual decrease in C stocks in biomass due to losses on converted land (wood removals or fellings, 
fuelwood collection, and disturbances) can be estimated using Equations 2.11 to 2.14.  As with increases in 
carbon stocks, Tier 1 follows the default assumption that there is no change in initial carbon stocks in biomass, 
and it can be applied for the areas that are estimated with the use of Approach 1 or 2 in Chapter 3, and default 
parameters in Section 4.5. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.20 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
iii) Higher tiers for estimating change in carbon stocks in biomass, (∆CB)  
Tiers 2 and 3: 
Tier 2 (and 3) methods use nationally-derived data and more disaggregated approaches and 
(or) process models, which allow for more precise estimates of changes in carbon stocks in biomass. In Tier 2, 
Equation 2.4 is replaced by Equation 2.15, where the changes in carbon stock are calculated as a sum of increase 
in carbon stock due to biomass growth, changes due to actual conversion (difference between biomass stocks 
before and after conversion), and decrease in carbon stocks due to losses.

Conversion to another land category may be associated with a change in biomass stocks, e.g., part of the biomass 
may be withdrawn through land clearing, restocking or other human-induced activities. These initial changes in 
carbon stocks in biomass (∆CCONVERSION) are calculated with the use of Equation 2.16 as follows:

The calculation of ∆CCONVERSION may be applied separately to estimate carbon stocks occurring on specific types

year for which the calculations are made, but the land affected by conversion should remain in the conversion 
category for 20 years or other period used in the inventory.  Inventories using higher Tier methods can define a 
disturbance matrix (Table 2.1) for land-use conversion to quantify the proportion of each carbon pool before 
conversion that is transferred to other pools, emitted to the atmosphere (e.g., slash burning), or otherwise 
removed during harvest or land clearing.

2.21 
Owing to the use of country specific data and more disaggregated approaches, the Equations 2.15 and 2.16 
provide for more accurate estimates than Tier 1 methods, where default data are used.  Additional improvement 
or accuracy would be achieved by using national data on areas of land-use transitions and country-specific 
carbon stock values.  Therefore, Tier 2 and 3 approaches should be inclusive of estimates that use detailed area 
data and country specific carbon stock values. 
2.3.2 
Change in carbon stocks in dead organic matter 
Dead organic matter (DOM) comprises dead wood and litter (See Table 1.1).  Estimating the carbon dynamics of 
dead organic matter pools allows for increased accuracy in the reporting of where and when carbon emissions 
and removals occur.  For example, only some of the carbon contained in biomass killed during a biomass 
burning is emitted into the atmosphere in the year of the fire. Most of the biomass is added to dead wood, litter 
and soil pools (dead fine roots are included in the soil) from where the C will be emitted over years to decades, 
as the dead organic matter decomposes. Decay rates differ greatly between regions, ranging from high in warm 
and moist environments to low in cold and dry environments. Although the carbon dynamics of dead organic 
matter pools are well understood qualitatively, countries may find it difficult to obtain actual data with national 
coverage on dead organic matter stocks and their dynamics.  
In forest ecosystems, DOM pools tend to be largest following stand-replacing disturbances due to the addition of 
residual above-ground and below-ground (roots) biomass. In the years after the disturbance, DOM pools decline 
as carbon loss through decay exceeds the rate of carbon addition through litterfall, mortality and biomass 
turnover. Later in stand development, DOM pools increase again. Representing these dynamics requires separate 
estimation of age-dependent inputs and outputs associated with stand dynamics and disturbance-related inputs 
and losses. These more complex estimation procedures require higher Tier methods. 
2.3.2.1 
LAND REMAINING IN A LAND-USE CATEGORY 
The Tier 1 assumption for both dead wood and litter pools for all land-use categories is that their stocks are not 
changing over time if the land remains within the same land-use category. Thus, the carbon in biomass killed 
during a disturbance or management event (less removal of harvested wood products) is assumed to be released 
entirely to the atmosphere in the year of the event. This is equivalent to the assumption that the carbon in non-
merchantable and non-commercial components that are transferred to dead organic matter is equal to the amount 
of carbon released from dead organic matter to the atmosphere through decomposition and oxidation. Countries 
can use higher tier methods to estimate the carbon dynamics of dead organic matter. This section describes 
estimation methods if Tier 2 (or 3) methods are used. 
Countries that use Tier 1 methods to estimate DOM pools in land remaining in the same land-use category, 
report zero changes in carbon stocks or carbon emissions from those pools. Following this rule, CO2 emissions 
resulting from the combustion of dead organic matter during fire are not reported, nor are the increases in dead 
organic matter carbon stocks in the years following fire. However, emissions of non-CO2 gases from burning of 
DOM pools are reported.  Tier 2 methods for estimation of carbon stock changes in DOM pools calculate the 
changes in dead wood and litter carbon pools (Equation 2.17). Two methods can be used: either track inputs and 
outputs (the Gain-Loss Method, Equation 2.18) or estimate the difference in DOM pools at two points in time 
(Stock-Difference Method, Equation 2.19). These estimates require either detailed inventories that include 
repeated measurements of dead wood and litter pools, or models that simulate dead wood and litter dynamics. It 
is good practice to ensure that such models are tested against field measurements and are documented. Figure 
2.3 provides the decision tree for identification of the appropriate tier to estimate changes in carbon stocks in 
dead organic matter.

The changes in carbon stocks in the dead wood and litter pools for an area remaining in a land-use category 
between inventories can be estimated using two methods, described in Equation 2.18 and Equation 2.19. The 
same equation is used for dead wood and litter pools, but their values are calculated separately.

The net balance of DOM pools specified in Equation 2.18, requires the estimation of both the inputs and outputs 
from annual processes (litterfall and decomposition) and the inputs and losses associated with disturbances. In 
practice, therefore, Tier 2 and Tier 3 approaches require estimates of the transfer and decay rates as well as 
activity data on harvesting and disturbances and their impacts on DOM pool dynamics. Note that the biomass 
inputs into DOM pools used in Equation 2.18 are a subset of the biomass losses estimated in Equation 2.7. The 
biomass losses in Equation 2.7 contain additional biomass that is removed from the site through harvest or lost to 
the atmosphere, in the case of fire. 
The method chosen depends on available data and will likely be coordinated with the method chosen for biomass 
carbon stocks. Transfers into and out of a dead wood or litter pool for Equation 2.18 may be difficult to estimate. 
The stock difference method described in Equation 2.19 can be used by countries with forest inventory data that 
include DOM pool information, other survey data sampled according to the principles set out in Annex 3A.3 
(Sampling) in Chapter 3, and/or models that simulate dead wood and litter dynamics.

Note that whenever the stock change method is used (e.g., in Equation 2.19), the area used in the carbon stock 
calculations at times t1 and t2 must be identical. If the area is not identical then changes in area will confound the 
estimates of carbon stocks and stock changes. It is good practice to use the area at the end of the inventory 
period (t2) to define the area of land remaining in the land-use category. The stock changes on all areas that 
change land-use category between t1 and t2 are estimated in the new land-use category, as described in the 
sections on land converted to a new land category.   
INPUT OF BIOMASS TO DEAD ORGANIC MATTER 
Whenever a tree is felled, non-merchantable and non-commercial components (such as tops, branches, leaves, 
roots, and noncommercial trees) are left on the ground and transferred to dead organic matter pools. In addition, 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use

annual mortality can add substantial amounts of dead wood to that pool. For Tier 1 methods, the assumption is 
that the carbon contained in all biomass components that are transferred to dead organic matter pools will be 
released in the year of the transfer, whether from annual processes (litterfall and tree mortality), land 
management activities, fuelwood gathering, or disturbances. For estimation procedures based on higher Tiers, it 
is necessary to estimate the amount of biomass carbon that is transferred to dead organic matter. The quantity of 
biomass transferred to DOM is estimated using Equation 2.20.

= fraction of biomass left to decay on the ground (transferred to dead organic matter) from loss

partitioned  into the fractions that are added to dead wood (cell B in Table 2.1) and to litter (cell C), 
are released to the atmosphere in the case of fire (cell F) and, if salvage follows the disturbance, 
transferred to HWP (cell E). 
Note: If root biomass increments are counted in Equation 2.10, then root biomass losses must also be 
counted in Equations 2.20, and 2.22. 
  
Examples of the terms on the right hand side of Equation 2.20 are obtained as follows:  
Transfers to dead organic matter from mortality, Lmortality 
Mortality is caused by competition during stand development, age, diseases, and other processes that are not 
included as disturbances. Mortality cannot be neglected when using higher Tier estimation methods. In 
extensively managed stands without periodic partial cuts, mortality from competition during the stem exclusion 
phase, may represent 30-50% of total productivity of a stand during its lifetime. In regularly tended stands, 
additions to the dead organic matter pool from mortality may be negligible because partial cuts extract forest 
biomass that would otherwise be lost to mortality and transferred to dead organic matter pools. Available data 
for increment will normally report net annual increment, which is defined as net of losses from mortality. Since 
in this text, net annual growth is used as a basis to estimate biomass gains, mortality must not be subtracted again 
as a loss from biomass pools. Mortality must, however, be counted as an addition to the dead wood pool for Tier 
2 and Tier 3 methods.  
The equation for estimating mortality is provided in Equation 2.21:

2.25 
When data on mortality rates are expressed as proportion of growing stock volume, then the term Gw in 
Equation 2.21 should be replaced with growing stock volume to estimate annual transfer to DOM pools from 
mortality. 
Mortality rates differ between stages of stand development and are highest during the stem exclusion phase of 
stand development. They also differ with stocking level, forest type, management intensity and disturbance 
history. Thus, providing default values for an entire climatic zone is not justified because the variation within a 
zone will be much larger than the variation between zones. 
Annual carbon transfer to slash, Lslash 
This involves estimating the quantity of slash left after wood removal or fuelwood removal and transfer of 
biomass from total annual carbon loss due to wood harvest (Equation 2.12). The estimate for logging slash is 
given in Equation 2.22 and which is derived from Equation 2.12 as explained below:

(tonne d.m. above-ground biomass)-1. R must be set to zero if root biomass increment is not included

CF = carbon fraction of dry matter, tonne C (tonne d.m.)-1  
Fuelwood gathering that involves the removal of live tree parts does not generate any additional input of biomass 
to dead organic matter pools and is not further addressed here. 
Inventories using higher Tier methods can also estimate the amount of logging slash remaining after harvest by 
defining the proportion of above-ground biomass that is left after harvest (enter these proportions in cells B and 
C of Table 2.1 for harvest disturbance) and by using the approach defined in Equation 2.14. In this approach, 
activity data for the area harvested would also be required. 
2.3.2.2 
LAND CONVERSION TO A NEW LAND-USE CATEGORY  
The reporting convention is that all carbon stock changes and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with 
a land-use change be reported in the new land-use category. For example, in the case of conversion of Forest 
Land to Cropland, both the carbon stock changes associated with the clearing of the forest as well as any 
subsequent carbon stock changes that result from the conversion are reported under the Cropland category. 
The Tier 1 assumption is that DOM pools in non-forest land categories after the conversion are zero, i.e., they 
contain no carbon. The Tier 1 assumption for land converted from forest to another land-use category is that all 
DOM carbon losses occur in the year of land-use conversion. Conversely, conversion to Forest Land results in 
buildup of litter and dead wood carbon pools starting from zero carbon in those pools. DOM carbon gains on 
land converted to forest occur linearly, starting from zero, over a transition period (default assumption is 20 
years). This default period may be appropriate for litter carbon stocks, but in temperate and boreal regions it is 
probably too short for dead wood carbon stocks. Countries that use higher Tier methods can accommodate 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.26 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
longer transition periods by subdividing the remaining category to accommodate strata that are in the later stages 
of transition.  
The estimation of carbon stock changes during transition periods following land-use conversion requires that 
annual cohorts of the area subject to land-use change be tracked for the duration of the transition period. For 
example, DOM stocks are assumed to increase for 20 years after conversion to Forest Land. After 20 years, the 
area converted enters the category Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, and no further DOM changes are 
assumed, if a Tier 1 approach is applied. Under Tier 2 and 3, the period of conversion can be varied depending 
on vegetation and other factors that determine the time required for litter and dead wood pools to reach steady 
state. 
Higher Tier estimation methods can use non-zero estimates of litter and dead wood pools in the appropriate land-
use categories or subcategories. For example, settlements and agro-forestry systems can contain some litter and 
dead wood pools, but because management, site conditions, and many other factors influence the pool sizes, no 
global default values can be provided here. Higher Tier methods may also estimate the details of dead organic 
matter inputs and outputs associated with the land-use change. 
The conceptual approach to estimating changes in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter pools is to estimate the 
difference in C stocks in the old and new land-use categories and to apply this change in the year of the 
conversion (carbon losses), or to distribute it uniformly over the length of the transition period (carbon gains)

Aon = area undergoing conversion from old to new land-use category, ha 
Ton = time period of the transition from old to new land-use category, yr. The Tier 1 default is 20 years 
for carbon stock increases and 1 year for carbon losses. 
Inventories using a Tier 1 method assume that all carbon contained in biomass killed during a land-use 
conversion event (less harvested products that are removed) is emitted directly to the atmosphere and none is 
added to dead wood and litter pools. Tier 1 methods also assume that dead wood and litter pool carbon losses 
occur entirely in the year of the transition.  
Countries using higher Tier methods can modify Co in Equation 2.23 by first accounting for the immediate 
effects of the land-use conversion in the year of the event. In this case, they would add to Co the carbon from 
biomass killed and transferred to the dead wood and litter pools and remove from Co any carbon released from 
dead wood and litter pools, e.g., during slash burning. In that case Co in Equation 2.23 would represent the dead 
wood or litter carbon stocks immediately after the land-use conversion. Co will transit to Cn over the transition 
period, using linear or more complex dynamics. A disturbance matrix (Table 2.1) can be defined to account for 
the pool transitions and releases during the land-use conversion, including the additions and removals to Co. 
Countries using a Tier 1 approach can apply the Tier 1 default carbon stock estimates for litter, and if available 
dead wood pools, provided in Table 2.2, but should recognize that these are broad-scale estimates with 
considerable uncertainty when applied at the country level. Table 2.2 is incomplete because of the paucity of 
published data. A review of the literature has identified several problems. The IPCC definitions of dead organic 
matter carbon stocks include litter and dead wood. The litter pool contains all litter plus fine woody debris up to 
a diameter limit of 10 cm (see Chapter 1, Table 1.1). Published litter data generally do not include the fine 
woody debris component, so the litter values in Table 2.2 are incomplete.  
There are numerous published studies of coarse woody debris (Harmon and Hua, 1991; Karjalainen and 
Kuuluvainen, 2002) and a few review papers (e.g., Harmon et al., 1986), and but to date only two studies are 
found to provide regional dead wood carbon pool estimates that are based on sample plot data.  Krankina et al. 
(2002) included several regions in Russia and reported coarse woody debris (> 10 cm diameter) estimates of 2 to 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.27 
7 Mg C ha-1. Cooms et al. (2002) reported regional carbon pools based on a statistical sample design for a small 
region in New Zealand. Regional compilations for Canada (Shaw et al., 2005) provide estimates of litter carbon 
pools based on a compilation of statistically non-representative sample plots, but do not include estimates of 
dead wood pools. Review papers such as Harmon et al. (1986) compile a number of estimates from the literature. 
For example, their Table 5 lists a range of coarse woody debris values for temperate deciduous forests of 11 – 38 
Mg dry matter ha-1 and for temperate coniferous forests of 10 – 511 Mg dry matter ha-1. It is, however, 
statistically invalid to calculate a mean from these compilations as they are not representative samples of the 
dead wood pools in a region. 
While it is the intent of these IPCC Guidelines to provide default values for all variables used in Tier 1 
methodologies, it is currently not feasible to provide  estimates of regional defaults values for litter (including 
fine woody debris < 10 cm diameter) and dead wood (> 10 cm diameter) carbon stocks. Litter pool estimates 
(excluding fine woody debris) are provided in Table 2.2. Tier 1 methodology only requires the estimates in Table 
2.2 for lands converted from Forest Land to any other land-use category (carbon losses) and for lands converted 
to Forest Land (carbon gains). Tier 1 methods assume that litter and dead wood pools are zero in all non-forest 
categories and therefore transitions between non-forest categories involve no carbon stock changes in these two 
pools.

Change in carbon stocks in soils  
Although both organic and inorganic forms of C are found in soils, land use and management typically has a 
larger impact on organic C stocks.  Consequently, the methods provided in these guidelines focus mostly on soil 
organic C. Overall, the influence of land use and management on soil organic C is dramatically different in a 
mineral versus an organic soil type.  Organic (e.g., peat and muck) soils have a minimum of 12 to 20 percent 
organic matter by mass (see Chapter 3 Annex 3A.5, for the specific criteria on organic soil classification), and 
develop under poorly drained conditions of wetlands (Brady and Weil, 1999).  All other soils are classified as 
mineral soil types, and typically have relatively low amounts of organic matter, occurring under moderate to well 
drained conditions, and predominate in most ecosystems except wetlands. Discussion about land-use and 
management influences on these contrasting soil types is provided in the next two sections. 
MINERAL SOILS 
Mineral soils are a carbon pool that is influenced by land-use and management activities.  Land use can have a 
large effect on the size of this pool through activities such as conversion of native Grassland and Forest Land to 
Cropland, where 20-40% of the original soil C stocks can be lost (Mann, 1986; Davidson and Ackerman, 1993; 
Ogle et al., 2005).  Within a land-use type, a variety of management practices can also have a significant impact 
on soil organic C storage, particularly in Cropland and Grassland (e.g., Paustian et al., 1997; Conant et al., 2001; 
Ogle et al., 2004 and 2005).  In principle, soil organic C stocks can change with management or disturbance if 
the net balance between C inputs and C losses from soil is altered. Management activities influence organic C 
inputs through changes in plant production (such as fertilization or irrigation to enhance crop growth), direct 
additions of C in organic amendments, and the amount of carbon left after biomass removal activities, such as 
crop harvest, timber harvest, fire, or grazing.  Decomposition largely controls C outputs and can be influenced by 
changes in moisture and temperature regimes as well as the level of soil disturbance resulting from the 
management activity.  Other factors also influence decomposition, such as climate and edaphic characteristics. 
Specific effects of different land-use conversions and management regimes are discussed in the land-use specific 
chapters (Chapters 4 to 9). 
Land-use change and management activity can also influence soil organic C storage by changing erosion rates 
and subsequent loss of C from a site; some eroded C decomposes in transport and CO2 is returned to the 
atmosphere, while the remainder is deposited in another location.  The net effect of changing soil erosion 
through land management is highly uncertain, however, because an unknown portion of eroded C is stored in 
buried sediments of wetlands, lakes, river deltas and coastal zones (Smith et al., 2001). 
ORGANIC SOILS 
Inputs of organic matter can exceed decomposition losses under anaerobic conditions, which are common in 
undrained organic soils, and considerable amounts of organic matter can accumulate over time.  The carbon 
dynamics of these soils are closely linked to the hydrological conditions, including available moisture, depth of 
the water table, and reduction-oxidation conditions (Clymo, 1984; Thormann et al., 1999).  Species composition 
and litter chemistry can also influence those dynamics (Yavitt et al., 1997).  
Carbon stored in organic soils will readily decompose when conditions become aerobic following soil drainage 
(Armentano and Menges, 1986; Kasimir-Klemedtsson et al., 1997).  Drainage is a practice used in agriculture 
and forestry to improve site conditions for plant growth.  Loss rates vary by climate, with drainage under warmer 
conditions leading to faster decomposition rates.  Losses of CO2 are also influenced by drainage depth; liming; 
the fertility and consistency of the organic substrate; and temperature (Martikainen et al., 1995). Greenhouse gas 
inventories capture this effect of management. 
While drainage of organic soils typically releases CO2 to the atmosphere (Armentano and Menges, 1986), there 
can also be a decrease in emissions of CH4 that occur in un-drained organic soils (Nykänen et al., 1995).  
However, CH4 emissions from un-drained organic soils are not addressed in the inventory guidelines with the 
exception of a few cases in which the wetlands are managed (See Chapter 7, Wetlands).  Similarly, national 
inventories typically do not estimate the accumulation of C in the soil pool resulting from the accumulation of 
plant detritus in un-drained organic soils. Overall, the rates of C gain are relatively slow in wetland environments 
with organic soils (Gorham, 1991), and any attempt to estimate C gains, even those created through wetland 
restoration, would also need to address the increase in CH4 emissions.  See additional guidance in Chapter 7 
Wetlands.

SOIL C ESTIMATION METHODS (LAND REMAINING IN A 
LAND-USE CATEGORY AND LAND CONVERSION TO A NEW 
LAND USE) 
Soil C inventories include estimates of soil organic C stock changes for mineral soils and CO2 emissions from 
organic soils due to enhanced microbial decomposition caused by drainage and associated management activity.  
In addition, inventories can address C stock changes for soil inorganic C pools (e.g., calcareous grasslands that 
become acidified over time) if sufficient information is available to use a Tier 3 approach. The equation for 
estimating the total change in soil C stocks is given in Equation 2.24:

LOrganic 
= annual loss of carbon from drained organic soils, tonnes C yr-1 
∆CInorganic = annual change in inorganic carbon stocks from soils, tonnes C yr-1 (assumed to be 0 unless 
using a Tier 3 approach) 
For Tier 1 and 2 methods, soil organic C stocks for mineral soils are computed to a default depth of 30 cm. 
Greater depth can be selected and used at Tier 2 if data are available, but Tier 1 factors are based on 30 cm depth. 
Residue/litter C stocks are not included because they are addressed by estimating dead organic matter stocks.  
Stock changes in organic soils are based on emission factors that represent the annual loss of organic C 
throughout the profile due to drainage. No Tier 1 or 2 methods are provided for estimating the change in soil 
inorganic C stocks due to limited scientific data for derivation of stock change factors; thus the net flux for 
inorganic C stocks is assumed to be zero.  Tier 3 methods can be used to refined estimates of the C stock changes 
in mineral and organic soils and for soil inorganic C pools.  
It is possible that countries will use different tiers to prepare estimates for mineral soils, organic soils, and soil 
inorganic C, given availability of resources. Thus, stock changes for mineral and organic soils and for inorganic 
C pools (Tier 3 only) are discussed separately.  A generalized decision tree in Figures 2.4 and 2.5 can be used to 
assist inventory compilers in determining the appropriate tier for estimating stock changes for mineral and 
organic soil C, respectively. 
Tier 1 Approach: Default Method 
Mineral soils 
For mineral soils, the default method is based on changes in soil C stocks over a finite period of time.  The 
change is computed based on C stock after the management change relative to the carbon stock in a reference 
condition (i.e., native vegetation that is not degraded or improved). The following assumptions are made: 
(i) 
Over time, soil organic C reaches a spatially-averaged, stable value specific to the soil, climate, 
land-use and management practices; and  
(ii) 
Soil organic C stock changes during the transition to a new equilibrium SOC occurs in a linear 
fashion. 
Assumption (i), that under a given set of climate and management conditions soils tend towards an equilibrium 
carbon content, is widely accepted.  Although, soil carbon changes in response to management changes may 
often be best described by a curvilinear function, assumption (ii) greatly simplifies the Tier 1 methodology and 
provides a good approximation over a multi-year inventory period, where changes in management and land-use 
conversions are occurring throughout the inventory period.  
Using the default method, changes in soil C stocks are computed over an inventory time period.  Inventory time 
periods will likely be established based on the years in which activity data are collected, such as 1990, 1995, 
2000, 2005 and 2010, which would correspond to inventory time periods of 1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005, 
2005-2010.  For each inventory time period, the soil organic C stocks are estimated for the first (SOC0-T) and last

year (SOC0) based on multiplying the reference C stocks by stock change factors. Annual rates of carbon stock 
change are estimated as the difference in stocks at two points in time divided by the time dependence of the 
stock change factors.

= land area of the stratum being estimated, ha. All land in the stratum should have common 
biophysical conditions (i.e., climate and soil type) and management history over the inventory time 
period to be treated together for analytical purposes.   
Inventory calculations are based on land areas that are stratified by climate regions (see Chapter 3 Annex 3A.5, 
for default classification of climate), and default soils types as shown in Table 2.3 (see Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5, 
for default classification of soils).  The stock change factors are very broadly defined and include: 1) a land-use 
factor (FLU) that reflects C stock changes associated with type of land use, 2) a management factor (FMG) 
representing the principal management practice specific to the land-use sector (e.g., different tillage practices in 
croplands), and 3) an input factor (FI) representing different levels of C input to soil. As mentioned above, FND is 
substituted for FLU in Forest Land to account for the influence of natural disturbance regimes (see Chapter 4, 
Section 4.2.3 for more discussion).  The stock change factors are provided in the soil C sections of the land-use 
chapters.  Each of these factors represents the change over a specified number of years (D), which can vary 
across sectors, but is typically invariant within sectors (e.g., 20 years for the cropland systems).  In some 
inventories, the time period for inventory (T years) may exceed D, and under those cases, an annual rate of 
change in C stock may be obtained by dividing the product of [(SOC0 – SOC(0 –T)) ● A] by T, instead of D.  See 
the soil C sections in the land-use chapters for detailed step-by-step guidance on the application of this method.

activity data has a direct influence on the formulation of the equation (See Box 2.1).  Activity data collected with

Where: 
p = parcel of land 
See the description of other terms under the Equation 2.25. 
Activity data may only be available using Approach 1 for data collection (Chapter 3).  These data 
provide the total area at two points in time for climate, soil and land-use/management systems, 
without quantification of the specific transitions in land use and management over the inventory 
time period (i.e., only the aggregate or net change is known, not the gross changes in activity).  
With Approach 1 activity data, mineral C stock changes are computed using formulation A of 
Equation 2.25.  In contrast, activity data may be collected based on surveys, remote sensing 
imagery or other data providing not only the total areas for each land management system, but also 
the specific transitions in land use and management over time on individual parcels of land.  These 
are considered Approach 2 and 3 activity data in Chapter 3, and soil C stock changes are computed 
using formulation B of Equation 2.25.  Formulation B contains a summation by land parcel (i.e., 
"p" represents land parcels in formulation B rather than the set of management systems “i”) that 
allows the inventory compiler to compute the changes in C stocks on a land parcel by land parcel 
basis. 
 
 
Special consideration is needed if using Approach 1 activity data (see Chapter 3) as the basis for estimating land-
use and management effects on soil C stocks, using Equation 2.25.  Approach 1 data do not track individual land 
transitions, and so SOC stock changes are computed for inventory time periods equivalent to D years, or as close 
as possible to D, which is 20 years in the Tier 1 method.  For example, Cropland may be converted from full 
tillage to no-till management between 1990 and 1995, and Formulation A (see Box 2.1) would estimate a gain in 
soil C for that inventory time period.  However, assuming that the same parcel of land remains in no-till between 
1995 and 2000, no additional gain in C would be computed (i.e., the stock for 1995 would be based on no-till 
management and it would not differ from the stock in 2000 (SOC0), which is also based on no-till management).  
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.35 
If using the default approach, there would be an error in this estimation because the change in soil C stocks 
occurs over 20 years (i.e., D = 20 years).  Therefore, SOC(0 –T) is estimated for the most distant time that is used 
in the inventory calculations up to D years before the last year in the inventory time periods (SOC0).  For 
example, assuming D is 20 and the inventory is based on activity data from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010, 
SOC(0 –T) will be computed for 1990 to estimate the change in soil organic C for each of the other years, (i.e., 
1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010).  The year for estimating SOC(0 –T) in this example will not change until activity data 
are gathered at 2011 or later (e.g., computing the C stock change for 2011 would be based on the most distant 
year up to, but not exceeding D, which in this example would be 1995).  
If transition matrices are available (i.e., Approach 2 or 3 activity data), the changes can be estimated between 
each successive year. From the example above, some no-till land may be returned to full tillage management 
between 1995 and 2000.  In this case, the gain in C storage between 1990 and 1995 for the land base returned to 
full tillage would need to be discounted between 1995 and 2000.  Further, no additional change in the C stocks 
would be necessary for land returned to full tillage after 2000 (assuming tillage management remained the same).  
Only land remaining in no-till would continue to gain C up to 2010 (i.e., assuming D is 20 years). Hence, 
inventories using transition matrices from Approach 2 and 3 activity data will need to be more careful in dealing 
with the time periods over which gains or losses of SOC are computed.  See Box 2.2 for additional details.  The 
application of the soil C estimation approach is much simpler if only using aggregated statistics with Approach 1 
activity data.  However, it is good practice for countries to use transition matrices from Approach 2 and 3 
activity data if that information is available because the more detailed statistics will provide an improved 
estimate of annual changes in soil organic C stocks. 
There may be some cases in which activity data are collected over time spans longer than the time dependence of 
the stock change factors (D), such as every 30 years with a D of 20.  For those cases, the annual stock changes 
can be estimated directly between each successive year of activity data collection (e.g., 1990, 2020 and 2050) 
without over- or under-estimating the annual change rate, as long as T is substituted for D in Equation 2.25. 
Organic soils 
The basic methodology for estimating C emissions from organic (e.g., peat-derived) soils is to assign an annual 
emission factor that estimates the losses of C following drainage.  Drainage stimulates oxidation of organic 
matter previously built up under a largely anoxic environment. Specifically, the area of drained and managed 
organic soils under each climate type is multiplied by the associated emission factor to derive an estimate of 
annual CO2 emissions (source), as presented in Equation 2.26:

For simplicity, it is assumed that the country has a single soil type, with a SOCRef (0-30 cm) value of 77 tonnes C ha-1, 
corresponding to forest vegetation. Values for FLU are 1.00, 1.05 and 0.92 for F, G and C, respectively. FMG and FI are 
assumed to be equal to 1. Time dependence of stock change factors (D) is 20 years. Finally, land-use is assumed to be in 
equilibrium in 1990 (i.e., no changes in land-use occurred during the 20 years prior to 1990).  When using Approach 1 
activity data (i.e., aggregate statistical data), annual changes in carbon stocks are computed for every inventory year 
following Equation 2.25 above. The following table shows the results of calculations:

If Approach 2 or 3 data are used in which land-use changes are explicitly known, carbon stocks can be computed taking 
into account historical changes for every individual land unit. The total carbon stocks for the sum of all units is 
compared with the most immediate previous inventory year, rather than with the inventory of 20 years before- to 
estimate annual changes in carbon stocks:

Both methods yield different estimates of carbon stocks, and use of Approach 2 or 3 data with transition matrices would 
be more accurate than use of Approach 1 aggregate statistics. However, estimates of annual changes of carbon stocks 
would generally not be very different, as shown in this example. The effect of underlying data approaches on the 
estimates differ more when there are multiple changes in land-use on the same piece of land (as in land units 2, 3 and 6 
in the example above). It is noteworthy that Approach 1, 2 and 3 activity data produce the same changes in C stocks if 
the systems reach a new equilibrium, which occurs with no change in land-use and management for a 20-year time 
period using the Tier 1 method.  Consequently, no carbon stock increases or losses are inadvertently lost when applying 
the methods for Approach 1, 2 or 3 activity data, but the temporal dynamics do vary somewhat as demonstrated above.

Soil inorganic C 
The effects of land-use and management activities on soil inorganic C stocks and fluxes are linked to site 
hydrology and depend on specific mineralogy of the soil.  Further, accurate estimation of the effects requires 
following the fate of discharged dissolved inorganic C and base cations from the managed land, at least until 
they are fully captured in the oceanic inorganic C cycle.  Thus, a comprehensive hydrogeochemical analysis that 
tracks the fate of dissolved CO2, carbonate and bicarbonate species and base cations (e.g., Ca and Mg) applied to, 
within, and discharged from, managed land over the long term is needed to accurately estimate net stock changes.  
Such an analysis requires a Tier 3 approach. 
Tier 2 Approach: Incorporating country-specific data 
A Tier 2 approach is a natural extension of the Tier 1 method that allows an inventory to incorporate country-
specific data, while using the default equations given for mineral and organic soils.  It is good practice for 
countries to use a Tier 2 approach, if possible, even if they are only able to better specify certain components of 
the Tier 1 default approach.  For example, a country may only have data to derive country-specific reference C 
stocks, which would then be used with default stock change factors to estimate changes in soil organic C stocks 
for mineral soils. 
Mineral soils 
Country-specific data can be used to improve four components of the Tier 1 inventory approach for estimating 
stock changes in mineral soils, including derivation of region or country-specific stock change factors and/or 
reference C stocks, in addition to improving the specification of management systems, climate, or soil categories 
(e.g., Ogle et al., 2003; Vanden Bygaart et al., 2004; Tate et al., 2005).  Inventory compilers can choose to 
derive specific values for all of these components, or any subset, which would be combined with default values 
provided in the Tier 1 method to complete the inventory calculations using Equation 2.25.  Also, Tier 2 uses the 
same procedural steps for calculations as provided for Tier 1. 
1) Defining management systems.  Although the same management systems may be used in a Tier 2 inventory 
as found in the Tier 1 method, the default systems can be disaggregated into a finer categorization that better 
represents management impacts on soil organic C stocks in a particular country based on empirical data (i.e., 
stock change factors vary significantly for the proposed management systems).  Such an undertaking, however, 
is only possible if there is sufficient detail in the underlying data to classify the land area into the finer, more 
detailed set of management systems. 
2) Climate regions and soil types.  Countries that have detailed soil classifications and climatic data have the 
option of developing country-specific classifications.  Moreover, it is considered good practice to specify better 
climate regions and soil types during the development of a Tier 2 inventory if the new classification improves 
the specification of reference C stocks and/or stock change factors.  In practice, reference C stocks and/or stock 
change factors should differ significantly among the proposed climate regions and soil types based on an 
empirical analysis.  Note that specifying new climate regions and/or soil types requires the derivation of country-
specific reference C stocks and stock change factors.  The default reference C stocks and stock change factors 
are only appropriate for inventories using the default climate and soil types. 
3) Reference C stocks.  Deriving country-specific reference C stocks (SOCRef) is another possibility for 
improving an inventory using a Tier 2 approach (Bernoux et al., 2002). Using country-specific data for 
estimating reference stocks will likely produce more accurate and representative values.  The derivation of 
country-specific reference soil C stocks can be done from measurements of soils, for example, as part of a 
country’s soil survey.  It is important that reliable taxonomic descriptions be used to group soils into categories. 
There are three additional considerations in deriving the country-specific values, including possible specification 
of country-specific soil categories and climate regions (i.e., instead of using the IPCC default classification), 
choice of reference condition, and depth increment over which the stocks are estimated.  Stocks are computed by 
multiplying the proportion of organic carbon (i.e., %C divided by 100) by the depth increment (default is 30 cm), 
bulk density, and the proportion of coarse-fragment free soil (i.e., < 2mm fragments) in the depth increment 
(Ogle et al., 2003).  The coarse fragment-free proportion is on a mass basis (i.e., mass of coarse fragment-free 
soil/total mass of the soil).  
The reference condition is the land-use/cover category that is used for evaluating the relative effect of land-use 
change on the amount of soil C storage (e.g., relative difference in C storage between a reference condition, such 
as native lands, and another land use, such as croplands, forming the basis for FLU in Equation 2.25).  In the Tier 
1 method, the reference condition is native lands (i.e., non-degraded, unimproved lands under native vegetation), 
and it is likely that many countries will use this same reference in a Tier 2 approach.  However, another land use 
can be selected for the reference, and this would be considered good practice if it allows for a more robust 
assessment of country-specific reference stock values.  Reference stocks should be consistent across the land 
uses (i.e., Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Settlements, and Other Land), requiring coordination among the 
various teams conducting soil C inventories for the AFOLU Sector. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.38 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Another consideration in deriving country-specific reference C stocks is the possibility of estimating C storage to 
a greater depth in the soil (i.e., lower in the profile).  Default stocks given in Table 2.3 account for soil organic C 
in the top 30 cm of a soil profile.  It is good practice to derive reference C stocks to a greater depth if there is 
sufficient data, and if it is clear that land-use change and management have a significant impact over the 
proposed depth increment.  Any change in the depth for reference C stocks will require derivation of new stock 
change factors, given that the defaults are also based on impacts to a 30 cm depth.   
4) Stock change factors.  An important advancement for a Tier 2 approach is the estimation of country-specific 
stock change factors (FLU, FMG and FI).  The derivation of country-specific factors can be accomplished using 
experimental/measurement data and computer model simulation. In practice, deriving stock change factors 
involves estimating a response ratio for each study or observation (i.e., the C stocks in different input or 
management classes are divided by the value for the nominal practice, respectively). 
Optimally, stock change factors are based on experimental/measurement data in the country or surrounding 
region, by estimating the response ratios from each study and then analyzing those values using an appropriate 
statistical technique (e.g., Ogle et al., 2003 and 2004; VandenBygaart et al., 2004).  Studies may be found in 
published literature, reports and other sources, or inventory compilers may choose to conduct new experiments.  
Regardless of the data source, it is good practice that the plots being compared have similar histories and 
management as well as similar topographic position, soil physical properties and be located in close proximity.  
Studies should provide C stocks (i.e., mass per unit area to a specified depth) or the information needed to 
estimate SOC stocks (i.e., percent organic matter together with bulk density; proportion of rock in soil, which is 
often measured as the greater than 2mm fraction and by definition contains no soil organic C).  If percent organic 
matter is available instead of percent organic carbon, a conversion factor of 0.58 can be used to estimate the C 
content. Moreover, it is good practice that the measurements of soil C stocks are taken on an equivalent mass 
basis (e.g., Ellert et al., 2001; Gifford and Roderick, 2003).   In order to use this method, the inventory compiler 
will need to determine a depth to measure the C stock for the nominal land use or practice, such as native lands 
or conventional tillage.  This depth will need to be consistent with the depth for the reference C stocks.  The soil 
C stock for the land-use or management change is then measured to a depth with the equivalent mass of soil.   
Another option for deriving country-specific values is to simulate stock change factors from advanced models 
(Bhatti et al., 2001). To demonstrate the use of advanced models, simulated stock change factors can be 
compared to with measured changes in C stocks from experiments. It is good practice to provide the results of 
model evaluation, citing published papers in the literature and/or placing the results in the inventory report.  This 
method is considered a Tier 2 approach because it relies on the stock change factor concept and the C estimation 
method elaborated in the Tier 1 approach.   
Derivation of country-specific management factors (FMG) and input factors (FI), either with empirical data or 
advanced models, will need to be consistent with the management system classification.  If more systems are 
specified for the inventory, unique factors will need to be derived representing the finer categories for a 
particular land use.   
Another consideration in deriving country-specific stock change factors is their associated time dependence (D 
in Equation 2.25), which determines the number of years over which the majority of a soil organic C stock 
change occurs, following a management change.  It is possible to use the default time dependence (D) for the 
land-use sector (e.g., 20 years for cropland), but the dependence can be changed if sufficient data are available to 
justify a different time period.   In addition, the method is designed to use the same time dependence (D) for all 
stock change factors as presented in Equation 2.25.  If different periods are selected for FLU, FMG and FI, it will 
be necessary to compute the influence of land use, management and inputs separately and divide the associated 
stock change dependence.  This can be accomplished by modifying Equation 2.25 so that SOC at time T and 0-T 
is computed individually for each of the stock change factors (i.e., SOC is computed with FLU only, then 
computed with FMG, and finally computed with FI).  The differences are computed for the stocks associated with 
land use, management, and input, dividing by their respective D values, and then the changes are summed.  
Changes in C stocks normally occur in a non-linear fashion, and it is possible to further develop the time 
dependence of stock change factors to reflect this pattern. For changes in land use or management that cause a 
decrease in soil C content, the rate of change is highest during the first few years, and progressively declines 
with time. In contrast, when soil C is increasing due to land-use or management change, the rate of accumulation 
tends to follow a sigmoidal curve, with rates of change being slow at the beginning, then increasing and finally 
decreasing with time. If historical changes in land-use or management practices are explicitly tracked by re-
surveying the same locations (i.e., Approach 2 or 3 activity data, see Chapter 3), it may be possible to implement 
a Tier 2 method that incorporates the non-linearity of changes in soil C stock.  
Similar to time dependence, the depth over which impacts are measured may vary from the default approach.  
However, it is important that the reference C stocks (SOCRef) and stock change factors (FLU, FMG, FI) be 
determined to a common depth, and that they are consistent across each land-use sector in order to deal with 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.39 
conversions among uses without artificially inflating or deflating the soil C stock change estimates.  It is good 
practice to document the source of information and underlying basis for the new factors in the reporting process.   
Organic soils 
A Tier 2 approach for CO2 emissions associated with drainage of organic soils incorporates country-specific 
information into the inventory to estimate the emissions using Equation 2.26 (see the previous Tier 1 section for 
additional discussion on the general equations and application of this method). Also, Tier 2 uses the same 
procedural steps for calculations as provided for Tier 1. Potential improvements to the Tier 1 approach may 
include: 1) a derivation of country-specific emission factors, 2) specification of climate regions considered more 
suitable for the country, or 3) a finer, more detailed classification of management systems attributed to a land-use 
category.   
Derivation of country-specific emission factors is good practice if experimental data are available.  Moreover, it 
is good practice to use a finer classification for climate and management systems if there are significant 
differences in measured C loss rates among the proposed classes. Note that any derivation must be accompanied 
with sufficient land-use/management activity and environmental data to represent the proposed climate regions 
and management systems at the national scale. Developing the Tier 2 inventory for organic soils has similar 
considerations as mineral soils discussed in previous section. 
Country-specific emission factors for organic soils can be based on measurements of annual declines in C stocks 
for the whole soil profile.  Another alternative is to use land subsidence as a surrogate measure for C loss 
following drainage (e.g., Armentano and Menges, 1986).  C loss is computed as a the fraction of the annual 
subsidence attributed to oxidation of organic matter, C content of the mineralized organic matter, and bulk 
density of the soil (Ogle et al., 2003). 
Soil inorganic C 
See discussion for this sub-category under Tier 1. 
Tier 3: Advanced estimation systems 
Tier 3 approaches for soil C involve the development of an advanced estimation system that will typically better 
capture annual variability in fluxes, unlike Tier 1 and 2 approaches that mostly assume a constant annual change 
in C stocks over an inventory time period based on a stock change factor.   Essentially, Tiers 1 and 2 represent 
land-use and management impacts on soil C stocks as a linear shift from one equilibrium state to another. To 
understand the implications better, it is important to note that soil C stocks typically do not exist in an absolute 
equilibrium state or change in a linear manner through a transition period, given that many of the driving 
variables affecting the stocks are dynamic, periodically changing at shorter time scales before a new “near” 
equilibrium is reached.  Tier 3 approaches can address this non-linearity using more advanced models than Tiers 
1 and 2 methods, and/or by developing a measurement-based inventory with a monitoring network.  In addition, 
Tier 3 inventories are capable of capturing longer-term legacy effects of land use and management. In contrast, 
Tiers 1 and 2 approaches typically only address the most recent influence of land use and management, such as 
the last 20 years for mineral C stocks. See Section 2.5 (Generic Guidance for Tier 3 methods) for additional 
discussion on Tier 3 methods beyond the text given below. 
Mineral soils 
Model-based approaches can use mechanistic simulation models that capture the underlying processes driving 
carbon gains and losses from soils in a quantitative framework, such as the influence of land use and 
management on processes controlling carbon input resulting from plant production and litter fall as well as 
microbial decomposition (e.g., McGill, 1996; Smith et al., 1997b; Smith et al., 2000; Falloon and Smith, 2002; 
and Tate et al., 2005).  Note that Tier 3 methods provide the only current opportunity to explicitly estimate the 
impact of soil erosion on C fluxes.  In addition, Tier 3 model-based approaches may represent C transfers 
between biomass, dead biomass and soils, which are advantageous for ensuring conservation of mass in 
predictions of C stock changes in these pools relative to CO2 removals and emissions to the atmosphere. 
Tier 3 modelling approaches are capable of addressing the influence of land use and management with a 
dynamic representation of environmental conditions that affect the processes controlling soil C stocks, such as 
weather, edaphic characteristics, and other variables.  The impact of land use and management on soil C stocks 
can vary as environmental conditions change, and such changes are not captured in lower Tiers, which may 
create biases in those results.  Consequently, Tier 3 approaches are capable of providing a more accurate 
estimation of C stock changes associated with land-use and management activity.     
For Tier 3 approaches, a set of benchmark sites will be needed to evaluate model results.  Ideally, a series of 
permanent, benchmark monitoring sites would be established with statistically replicated design, capturing the 
major climatic regions, soil types, and management systems as well as system changes, and would allow for 
repeated measurements of soil organic C stocks over time (Smith, 2004a).  Monitoring is based on re-sampling 
plots every 3 to 5 years or each decade; shorter sampling frequencies are not likely to produce significant 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.40 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
differences due to small annual changes in C stocks relative to the large total amount of C in a soil (IPCC, 2000; 
Smith, 2004b).  
In addition to model-based approaches, Tier 3 methods afford the opportunity to develop a measurement-based 
inventory using a similar monitoring network as needed for model evaluation.  However, measurement networks, 
which serve as the basis for a complete inventory, will have a considerably larger sampling density to minimize 
uncertainty, and to represent all management systems and associated land-use changes, across all climatic 
regions and major soil types (Sleutel et al., 2003; Lettens et al., 2004).   Measurement networks can be based on 
soil sampling at benchmark sites or flux tower networks.  Flux towers, such as those using eddy covariance 
systems (Baldocchi et al., 2001), constitute a unique case in that they measure the net exchange of CO2 between 
the atmosphere and land surface. Thus, with respect to changes in C stocks for the soil pool, flux tower 
measurement networks are subject to the following caveats: 1) towers need to occur at a sufficient density to 
represent fluxes for the entire country; 2) flux estimates need to be attributed to individual land-use sectors and 
specific land-use and management activities; and 3) CO2 fluxes need to be further attributed to individual pools 
including stock changes in soils (also biomass and dead organic matter). Additional considerations about soil 
measurements are given in the previous section on Tier 2 methods for mineral soils (See stock change factor 
discussion). 
It is important to note that measurement based inventories represent full C estimation approaches, addressing all 
influences on soil C stocks. Partial estimation of only land-use and management effects may be difficult.  
Organic soils 
Similar to mineral soils, CO2 emissions attributed to land use and management of organic soils can be estimated 
with a model or measurement based approach.  Dynamic, mechanistic-based models will typically be used to 
simulate underlying processes, while capturing the influence of land use and management, particularly the effect 
of variable levels of drainage on decomposition.  The same considerations that were mentioned for mineral soils 
are also important for model- and measurement-based approaches addressing soil C stock changes attributed to 
management of organic soils. 
Soil inorganic C 
A Tier 3 approach may be further developed to estimate fluxes associated with management impacts on soil 
inorganic C pools.  For example, irrigation can have an impact on soil inorganic C stocks and fluxes, but the 
direction and magnitude depends on the source and nature of irrigation water and the source, amount, and fate of 
discharged dissolved inorganic C.  In arid and semi-arid regions, gypsum (CaSO4 . 2H2O) amendments can lead 
to an increase in soil inorganic C stocks depending on the amount of Ca2+ that replaces Na+ on soil colloids, 
relative to reaction with bicarbonate and precipitation of calcite (CaCO3). Other land-use and management 
activities, such as deforestation/afforestation and soil acidifying management practices can also affect soil 
inorganic C stocks.  However, these changes can cause gains or losses of C in this pool depending on site-
specific conditions and the amount attributable to the activity can be small.  
Few models currently exist for estimating changes in soil inorganic C due to land use and management, and so a 
Tier 3 approach may require considerable time and resources to implement. Where data and knowledge are 
sufficient and activities that significantly change soil inorganic C stocks are prevalent, it is good practice for 
countries to do a comprehensive hydro-geochemical analysis that includes all important land-use and 
management activities to estimate their effect on soil inorganic C stocks.  A modelling approach would need to 
isolate the land-use and management activities from non-anthropogenic effects.  Alternatively, a measurement-
based approach can be used by periodically sampling benchmark sites in managed lands for determining 
inorganic C stocks in situ, or possibly CO2 fluxes, in combination with a monitoring network for soil organic C 
as discussed above for mineral soils.  However, the amount and fate of dissolved inorganic C would require 
further measurements, modelling, or simplifying assumptions, such as all leaching losses of inorganic C are 
assumed to be emitted as CO2 to the atmosphere.  
2.4 
NON-CO2 EMISSIONS 
There are significant emissions of non-greenhouse gases from biomass burning, livestock and manure 
management, or soils. N2O emissions from soils are covered in Chapter 11, where guidance is given on methods 
that can be applied nationally (i.e., irrespective of land-use types) if a country chooses to use national scale 
activity data. The guidance on CH4 and N2O emissions from livestock and manure are addressed only in Chapter 
10 because emissions do not depend on land characteristics. A generic approach to estimating greenhouse gas 
emissions from fire (both CO2 and non-CO2 gases) is described below, with land-use specific enhancements 
given in the Forest Land, Grassland and Cropland chapters. It is good practice to check for complete coverage of 
CO2 and non-CO2 emissions due to losses in carbon stocks and pools to avoid omissions or double counting. 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.41 
Emissions from fire include not only CO2, but also other greenhouse gases, or precursors of greenhouse gases, 
that originate from incomplete combustion of the fuel. These include carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), 
non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and nitrogen (e.g., N2O, NOx) species (Levine, 1994). In 
the 1996 IPCC Guidelines and GPG2000, non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from fire in savannas and burning 
of crop residues were addressed along with emissions from Forest Land and Grassland conversion. The 
methodology differed somewhat by vegetation type, and fires in Forest Land were not included. In the GPG-
LULUCF, emissions (CO2 and non-CO2) from fires were addressed, particularly in the chapter covering Forest 
Land (losses of carbon resulting from disturbances). In the Cropland and Grassland chapters, only non-CO2 
emissions were considered, with the assumption that the CO2 emissions would be counterbalanced by CO2 
removals from the subsequent re-growth of the vegetation within one year. This assumption implies maintenance 
of soil fertility – an assumption which countries may ignore if they have evidence of fertility decline due to fire. 
In Forest Land, there is generally a lack of synchrony (non-equivalence of CO2 emissions and removals in the 
year of reporting).   
These Guidelines provide a more generic approach for estimating emissions from fire.  Fire is treated as a 
disturbance that affects not only the biomass (in particular, above-ground), but also the dead organic matter 
(litter and dead wood). The term `biomass burning` is widely used and is retained in these Guidelines, but 
acknowledging that fuel components other than live biomass are often very significant, especially in forest 
systems. For Cropland and Grassland having little woody vegetation, reference is usually made to biomass 
burning, since biomass is the main pool affected by the fire. 
Countries should apply the following principles when estimating greenhouse gas emissions resulting from fires 
in Forest Land, Cropland and Grassland: 
• 
Coverage of reporting: Emissions (CO2 and non- CO2) need to be reported for all fires (prescribed fires and 
wildfires) on managed lands (the exception is CO2 from Grassland, as discussed below). Where there is a 
land-use change, any greenhouse gas emission from fire should be reported under the new land-use category 
(transitional category). Emissions from wildfires (and escaped prescribed fires) that occur on unmanaged 
lands do not need to be reported, unless those lands are followed by a land-use change (i.e., become 
managed land). 
• 
Fire as a management tool (prescribed burning): greenhouse gas emissions from the area burnt are reported, 
and if the fire affects unmanaged land, greenhouse gas emissions should also be reported if the fire is 
followed by a land-use change. 
• 
Equivalence (synchrony) of CO2 emissions and removals: CO2 net emissions should be reported where the 
CO2 emissions and removals for the biomass pool are not equivalent in the inventory year. For grassland 
biomass burning and burning of agriculture residues, the assumption of equivalence is generally reasonable. 
However, woody vegetation may also burn in these land categories, and greenhouse gas emissions from 
those sources should be reported using a higher Tier method. Further, in many parts of the world, grazing is 
the predominant land use in Forest Land that are regularly burnt (e.g., grazed woodlands and savannas), and 
care must be taken before assuming synchrony in such systems. For Forest Land, synchrony is unlikely if 
significant woody biomass is killed (i.e., losses represent several years of growth and C accumulation), and 
the net emissions should be reported. Examples include: clearing of native forest and conversion to 
agriculture and/or plantations and wildfires in Forest Land.  
• 
Fuels available for combustion: Factors that reduce the amount of fuels available for combustion (e.g., from 
grazing, decay, removal of biofuels, livestock feed, etc.) should be accounted for. A mass balance approach 
should be adopted to account for residues, to avoid underestimation or double counting (refer to Section 
2.3.2).  
• 
Annual reporting: despite the large inherent spatial and temporal variability of fire (in particular that from 
wildfires), countries should estimate and report greenhouse gas emissions from fire on an annual basis.      
These Guidelines provide a comprehensive approach for estimating carbon stock changes and non-CO2 
emissions resulting from fire in the Forest Land (including those resulting from forest conversion), and non-CO2 
emissions in the Cropland and Grassland. Non-CO2 emissions are addressed for the following five types of 
burning: (1) grassland burning (which includes perennial woody shrubland and savanna burning); (2) agricultural 
residues burning; (3) burning of litter, understory and harvest residues in Forest Land, (4) burning following 
forest clearing and conversion to agriculture; and (5) other types of burning (including those resulting  from 
wildfires). Direct emissions of CO2 are also addressed for items (3) and (4) and (5). Since estimating emissions 
in these different categories have many elements in common, this section provides a generic approach to 
estimate CO2 and non-CO2 emissions from fire, to avoid repetition in specific land-use sections that address 
emissions from fire in these Guidelines.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.42 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Prescribed burning of savannas is included under the grassland biomass burning section (Chapter 6, Grassland, 
Section 6.3.4). It is important to avoid double counting when estimating greenhouse gas emissions from 
savannas that have a vegetation physiognomy characteristic of Forest Land. An example of this is the cerradão 
(dense woodland) formation in Brazil which, although being a type of savanna, is included under Forest Land, 
due to its biophysical characteristics.   
In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions from combustion, fires may lead to the creation of an inert carbon 
stock (charcoal or char). Post-fire residues comprise unburned and partially burnt components, as well as a small 
amount of char that due to its chemical nature is highly resistant to decomposition. The knowledge of the rates of 
char formation under contrasting burning conditions and subsequent turnover rates is currently too limited 
(Forbes et al., 2006; Preston and Schmidt, 2006) to allow development of a reliable methodology for inventory 
purposes, and hence is not included in these Guidelines. A technical basis for further methodological 
development is included in Appendix 1. 
Additionally, although emissions of NMVOC also occur as a result of fire, they are not addressed in the present 
Guidelines due to the paucity of the data and size of uncertainties in many of the key parameters needed for the 
estimation, which prevent the development of reliable emission estimates.  
METHOD DESCRIPTION 
Each relevant section in these Guidelines includes a three-tiered approach to address CO2 (where applicable) and 
non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from fire. The choice of Tier can be made following the steps in the decision 
tree presented in Figure 2.6. Under the Tier 1 approach, the formulation presented in Equation 2.27 can be 
applied to estimate CO2 and non-CO2 emissions from fire, using the default data provided in this chapter and in 
the relevant land-use sections of these Guidelines. Higher Tiers involve a more refined application of Equation 
2.27. 
Since Tier 1 methodology adopts a simplified approach to estimating the dead organic matter pool (see Section 
2.3.2), certain assumptions must be made when estimating net greenhouse gas emissions from fire in those 
systems (e.g. Forest Land, and Forest Land converted to another land use), where dead organic matter can be a 
major component of the fuel burnt.  Emissions of CO2 from dead organic matter are assumed to be zero in forests 
that are burnt, but not killed by fire. If the fire is of sufficient intensity to kill a portion of the forest stand, under 
Tier 1 methodology, the C contained in the killed biomass is assumed to be immediately released to the 
atmosphere. This Tier 1 simplification may result in an overestimation of actual emissions in the year of the fire, 
if the amount of biomass carbon killed by the fire is greater than the amount of dead wood and litter carbon 
consumed by the fire.  
Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions are estimated for all fire situations. Under Tier 1, non-CO2 emissions are 
best estimated using the actual fuel consumption provided in Table 2.4, and appropriate emission factors (Table 
2.5) (i.e., not including newly killed biomass as a component of the fuel consumed). Clearly, if fire in forests 
contributes significantly to net greenhouse gas emissions, countries are encouraged to develop a more complete 
methodology (higher tiers) which includes the dynamics of dead organic matter and improves the estimates of 
direct and post-fire emissions. 
For Forest Land converted to another land uses, organic matter burnt is derived from both newly felled 
vegetation and existing dead organic matter, and CO2 emissions should be reported.  In this situation, estimates 
of total fuel consumed (Table 2.4) can be used to estimate emissions of CO2 and non- greenhouse gases using 
Equation 2.27. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that dead organic matter carbon losses during the land-
use conversion are not double counted in Equations 2.27 (as losses from burning) and Equation 2.23 (as losses 
from decay). 
A generic methodology to estimate the emissions of individual greenhouse gases for any type of fire is 
summarized in Equation 2.27.

MB = mass of fuel available for combustion, tonnes ha-1. This includes biomass, ground litter and dead 
wood. When Tier 1 methods are used then litter and dead wood pools are assumed zero, except 
where there is a land-use change (see Section 2.3.2.2).

Cf = combustion factor, dimensionless (default values in Table 2.6) 
Gef = emission factor, g kg-1 dry matter burnt (default values in Table 2.5) 
Note: Where data for MB and Cf  are not available, a default value for the amount of fuel actually burnt 
(the product of MB and Cf  ) can be used (Table 2.4) under Tier 1 methodology.  
For CO2 emissions, Equation 2.27 relates to Equation 2.14, which estimates the annual amount of live biomass 
loss from any type of disturbance.  
The amount of fuel that can be burnt is given by the area burnt and the density of fuel present on that area. The 
fuel density can include biomass, dead wood and litter, which vary as a function of the type, age and condition of 
the vegetation.  The type of fire also affects the amount of fuel available for combustion. For example, fuel 
available for low-intensity ground fires in forests will be largely restricted to litter and dead organic matter on 
the surface, while a higher-intensity ‘crown fire’ can also consume substantial amounts of tree biomass.   
The combustion factor is a measure of the proportion of the fuel that is actually combusted, which varies as a 
function of the size and architecture of the fuel load (i.e., a smaller proportion of large, coarse fuel such as tree 
stems will be burnt compared to fine fuels, such as grass leaves), the moisture content of the fuel and the type of 
fire (i.e., intensity and rate of spread which is markedly affected by climatic variability and regional differences 
as reflected in Table 2.6).  Finally, the emission factor gives the amount of a particular greenhouse gas emitted 
per unit of dry matter combusted, which can vary as a function of the carbon content of the biomass and the 
completeness of combustion. For species with high N concentrations, NOx and N2O emissions from fire can vary 
as a function of the N content of the fuel. A comprehensive review of emission factors was conducted by 
Andreae and Merlet (2001) and is summarized in Table 2.5. 
Tier 2 methods employ the same general approach as Tier 1 but make use of more refined country-derived 
emission factors and/or more refined estimates of fuel densities and combustion factors than those provided in 
the default tables. Tier 3 methods are more comprehensive and include considerations of the dynamics of fuels 
(biomass and dead organic matter).

2.5 
ADDITIONAL GENERIC GUIDANCE FOR TIER 
3 METHODS 
The guidelines in this volume focus mainly on Tier 1 methods, along with general guidance to assist with the 
development of a Tier 2 inventory.  Less attention is given to Tier 3 methods, but some general guidance is 
provided in this section.  Tier 3 inventories are advanced systems using measurements and/or modelling, with 
the goal of improving the estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals, beyond what is possible 
with Tier 1 or 2 approaches.  In this section, guidelines are elaborated that provide a sound scientific basis for the 
development of Tier 3 Inventories. These guidelines do not limit the selection of Tier 3 sampling schemes or 
modelling approaches, but provide general guidance to assist the inventory developer in the implementation. 
Specific issues surrounding Tier 3 approaches for individual source categories may be provided later in the 
volume, and supplement the general guidance found in this section. 
2.5.1 
Measurement-based Tier 3 inventories 
Inventories can be based on direct measurements of C stock changes from which emissions and removals of 
carbon are estimated. Measurement of some non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions is possible, but because of the 
high spatial and temporal variability of non-CO2 emissions, Tier 3 methods will likely combine process models 
with measurements to estimate non-CO2 emissions. Purely measurement-based inventories, e.g., based on 
repeated measurements using a national forest inventory can derive carbon stock change estimates without 
relying on process models, but they do require appropriate statistical models for the spatial and temporal scaling 
of plot measurements to a national inventory. Approaches based on dynamic models (e.g., process-based 
models) to estimate national emissions will be discussed in Section 2.5.2.  In general, six steps are involved with 
implementation of a Tier 3 measurement-based inventory. 
Step 1.  Develop sampling scheme. Sampling schemes can be developed using a variety of approaches, but 
typically involve some level of randomization of sampling sites within strata. (Even inventories based on a 
regular grid typically select the starting point of the grid at random).  Inventory compilers will determine an 
appropriate approach given the size of their country, key environmental variables (e.g., climate) and 
management systems in their region.  The latter two may serve as stratification variables, assuming the sampling 
scheme is not completely random.  In addition, it is good practice for sampling to provide wide spatial coverage 
of emissions and/or removals for a particular key source category.   
The inventory compiler should establish an appropriate time period over which sites will be re-sampled if using a 
repeated measures design. The timing of re-measurement will depend on the rate of stock changes or non-CO2 
greenhouse gas emissions. For example, re-measurement periods in boreal and some temperate regions, where 
trees grow slowly and DOM pools change little in single years, can be longer than in environments where carbon 
dynamics are more rapid. Where fluxes are measured directly, greater temporal and spatial variability will 
require more frequent or more intensive sampling to capture fluxes which might otherwise be missing from the 
measurement record.  
Some approaches do not include re-sampling of the same sites.  Such designs are acceptable, but may limit the 
statistical power of the analysis, and therefore lead to greater uncertainty.  It is likely that a repeated measures 
design will provide a better basis for estimating carbon stock changes or emissions in most countries. 
It is good practice to develop a methodology handbook explaining the sampling scheme as part of Step 1. This 
handbook can be useful for those involved with the measurements, laboratory analyses and other aspects of the 
process, as well as possibly providing supporting material for documentation purposes.  
Step 2.  Select sampling sites.  Specific sampling sites will be located based on sampling design. It is good 
practice to have alternative sites for sampling in case it is not possible to sample some original locations.  In a 
repeated measures design, the sites will become a monitoring network that is periodically re-sampled. 
Determining sampling locations will likely involve the use of a geographic information system. A geographic 
database may include a variety of environmental and management data, such as climate, soils, land use, and 
livestock operations, depending on the source category and stratification.  If key data are not available at the 
national scale, the inventory developer should re-evaluate the design and stratification (if used) in Step 1 and 
possibly modify the sampling design.   
Sampling may require coordination among different national ministries, provincial or state governments, 
corporate and private land owners. Establishing relationships among these stakeholders can be undertaken before 
collecting initial samples.  Informing stakeholders about ongoing monitoring may also be helpful and lead to 
greater success in implementing monitoring programs. 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.51 
Step 3.  Collect initial samples.  Once the final set of sites are determined, a sampling team can visit those 
locations, establish plots and collect initial samples.  The initial samples will provide initial carbon stocks, or 
serve as the first measure of emissions. It is good practice to establish field measurement and laboratory 
protocols before the samples are collected. In addition, it may be helpful to take geographic coordinates of plot 
locations or sample points with a global positioning system, and, if repeated measures are planned, to 
permanently mark the location for ease of finding and re-sampling the site in the future.   
It is good practice to take relevant measurements and notes of the environmental conditions and management at 
the site.  This will confirm that the conditions were consistent with the design of the sampling scheme, and also 
may be used in data analysis (Step 5).  If a stratified sampling approach is used, and it becomes apparent that 
many or most sites are not consistent with the expected environmental conditions and management systems, it is 
good practice to repeat Step 1, re-evaluating and possibly modifying the sampling scheme based on the new 
information.    
Step 4.  Re-sample the monitoring network on a periodic basis.  For repeated measures designs, sampling sites 
will be periodically re-sampled in order to evaluate trends in carbon stocks or non-CO2 emissions over an 
inventory time period.  The time between re-measurement will depend on the rate of stock changes or the 
variability in emissions, the resources available for the monitoring program, and the design of the sampling 
scheme.   
If destructive sampling is involved, such as removing a soil core or biomass sample, it is good practice to re-
sample at the same site but not at the exact location in which the sample was removed during the past.  
Destructive sampling the exact location is likely to create bias in the measurements.  Such biases would 
compromise the monitoring and produce results that are not representative of national trends. 
Step 5.  Analyze data and determine carbon stock changes/non-CO2 emissions, and infer national emissions and 
removal estimates and measures of uncertainty.  It is good practice to select an appropriate statistical method for 
data analysis based on the sampling design.  The overall result of the statistical analysis will be estimates of 
carbon stock changes or measurements of emissions from which the national emission and removal estimates can 
be derived. It is good practice to also include estimates of uncertainty, which will include measurement errors in 
the sample collection and laboratory processing (i.e., the latter may be addressed using standards and through 
cross-checking results with independent labs), sampling variance associated with monitoring design and other 
relevant sources of uncertainty (see discussion for each source category later in this volume in addition to the 
uncertainty chapter in Volume 1).  The analysis may include scaling of measurements to a larger spatial or 
temporal domain, which again will depend on the design of the sampling scheme.  Scaling may range from 
simple averaging or weighted averaging to more detailed interpolation/extrapolation techniques.   
To obtain national estimates of stock changes or emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, it is often necessary to 
extrapolate measurements using models that take into consideration environmental conditions, management and 
other activity data. While the net changes of carbon-based greenhouse gasses can (at least in theory) be estimated 
purely by repeated measurements of carbon stocks, statistical and other models are often employed to assist in 
the scaling of plot measures to national estimates. National emission estimates of non-CO2 greenhouse gases are 
unlikely to be derived from measurements alone because of the expense and difficulty in obtaining the 
measurement. For example, N2O emissions from forest fires cannot be measured empirically but are typically 
inferred from samples, activity data on the area burnt, and fuel consumption estimates. In contrast, soil N2O 
emissions can be readily estimated using chambers, but it would be very expensive to establish a network with 
the sampling intensity needed to provide national emission estimates based solely on measurements without use 
of models for extrapolation. 
It is good practice to analyze emissions relative to environmental conditions in addition to the contribution of 
various management practices to those trends.  Interpretation of the patterns will be useful in evaluating 
possibilities for future mitigation. 
Step 6.  Reporting and Documentation.  It is good practice to assemble inventory results in a systematic and 
transparent manner for reporting purposes.  Documentation may include a description of the sampling scheme 
and statistical methods, sampling schedule (including re-sampling), stock change and emissions estimates and 
the interpretation of emission trends (e.g., contributions of management activities).  In addition, QA/QC should 
be completed and documented in the report, including quality assurance procedures in which peer-reviewers not 
involved with the analysis evaluate the methodology.  For details on QA/QC, reporting and documentation, see 
the section dealing with the specific source category later in this volume, as well as information provided in 
Volume 1, Chapter 6.

Model-based Tier 3 inventories 
Model-based inventories are developed using empirical, process-based or other types of advanced models. It is 
good practice to have independent measurements to confirm that the model is capable of estimating emissions 
and removals in the source categories of interest (Prisley and Mortimer, 2004).  In general, seven steps are used 
to implement a Tier 3 model-based inventory (Figure 2.7). 
Step 1. Select/develop a model for calculating the stock changes and/or greenhouse gas emissions.  A model 
should be selected or developed that more accurately represents stock changes or non-CO2 greenhouse gas 
emissions than is possible with Tiers 1 and 2 approaches.  As part of this decision, it is good practice to consider 
the availability of input data (Steps 3) and the computing resources needed to implement the model (Step 5).

Step 2. Evaluation with calibration data.  This is a critical step for inventory development in which model 
results are compared directly with measurements that were used for model calibration/parameterization (e.g., 
Falloon and Smith, 2002).  Comparisons can be made using statistical tests and/or graphically, with the goal of 
demonstrating that the model effectively simulates measured trends for a variety of conditions in the source 
category of interest. It is good practice to ensure that the model responds appropriately to variations in activity 
data and that the model is able to report results by land-use category as per the conventions laid out in Chapter 3. 
Re-calibration of the model or modifications to the structure (i.e., algorithms) may be necessary if the model 
does not capture general trends or there are large systematic biases.  In some cases, a new model may be selected 
or developed based on this evaluation.  Evaluation results are an important component of the reporting 
documentation, justifying the use of a particular model for quantifying emissions in a source category. 
Step 3. Gather spatio-temporal data on activities and relevant environmental conditions that are needed as 
inputs to a model.  Models, even those used in Tiers 1 and 2 approaches, require specific input information in 
order to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with a source category.  These inputs may 
range from weather and soils data to livestock number, forest types, natural disturbances or cropping 
management practices.  It is good practice for the input data to be consistent with spatio-temporal scale of the 
model (i.e., algorithms).  For example, if a model operates on a daily time step then the input data should provide 
information about daily variation in the environmental characteristic or activity data.  In some cases, input data 
may be a limiting factor in model selection, requiring some models to be discarded as inappropriate given the 
available activity and/or environmental data. 
Step 4. Quantify uncertainties. Uncertainties are due to imperfect knowledge about the activities or processes 
leading to greenhouse gas fluxes, and are typically manifested in the model structure and inputs.  Consequently, 
uncertainty analyses are intended to provide a rigorous measure of the confidence attributed to a model estimate 
based on uncertainties in the model structure and inputs, generating a measure of variability in the carbon stock 
changes or non-CO2 greenhouse gas fluxes. Volume 1, Chapter 3 provides specific guidance on appropriate 
methods for conducting these analyses.  Additional information may also be provided for specific source 
categories later in this volume. 
Step 5. Implement the model. The major consideration for this step is that there are enough computing resources 
and personnel time to prepare the input data, conduct the model simulations, and analyze the results.  This will 
depend on the efficiency of the programming script, complexity of the model, as well as the spatial and temporal 
extent and resolution of the simulations.  In some cases, limitations in computing resources may constrain the 
complexity and range of spatial or temporal resolution that can be used in implementing at the national scale (i.e., 
simulating at finer spatial and temporal scales will require greater computing resources).  
Step 6. Evaluation with independent data.  It is important to realise the difference between Steps 2 and 6.  Step 2 
involves testing model output with field data that were used as a basis for calibration (i.e., parameterization).  In 
contrast, evaluation with independent data is done with a completely independent set of data from model 
calibration, providing a more rigorous assessment of model components and results.  Optimally, independent 
evaluation should be based on measurements from a monitoring network or from research sites that were not 
used to calibrate model parameters.  The network would be similar in principle to a series of sites that are used 
for a measurement-based inventory.  However, the sampling does not need to be as dense because the network is 
not forming the basis for estimating carbon stock changes or non-CO2 greenhouse gas fluxes, as in a purely 
measurement-based inventory, but is used to check model results.   
In some cases, independent evaluation may demonstrate that the model-based estimation system is inappropriate 
due to large and unpredictable differences between model results and the measured trends from the monitoring 
network.  Problems may stem from one of three possibilities: errors in the implementation step, poor input data, 
or an inappropriate model.  Implementation problems typically arise from computer programming errors, while 
model inputs may generate erroneous results if these data are not representative of management activity or 
environmental conditions.  In these two cases, it is good practice for the inventory developer to return to either 
Steps 3 or 6 depending on the issue.  It seems less likely that the model would be inappropriate if Step 2 was 
deemed reasonable.  However, if this is the case, it is good practice to return to the model selection/development 
phase (Step 1).   
During Step 2 that follows the selection/development step, it is good practice to avoid using the independent 
evaluation data to re-calibrate or refine algorithms.  If this occurs, these data would no longer be suitable for 
independent evaluation, and therefore not serve the purpose for Step 6 in this inventory approach.  
Step 7. Reporting and Documentation.  It is good practice to assemble inventory results in a systematic and 
transparent manner for reporting purposes.  Documentation may include a description of the model, summary of 
model input data sources, model evaluation results including sources of experiments and/or measurements data 
from monitoring network, stock change and emissions estimates and the interpretation of emission trends (i.e., 
contributions of management activities).  QA/QC should be completed and documented in the report.  For details
