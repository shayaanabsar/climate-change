This Reference Manual is one of three volumes of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for
National GHG Inventories. It provides a compendium of information on the various human
activities which cause greenhouse gas emissions or removals to occur. It builds on work
carried out in preparation of:
• OECD Report: Estimation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, Final Report From the
OECD Experts Meeting, 18-21 February 1991, (OECD, 1991).
• Proceedings of an International IPCC Workshop on Methane and Nitrous Oxide, Amersfoort,
NL, 3-5 February 1993 (van Amstel, 1993).
• 1995 IPCC Guidelines.
In preparing this document, the IPCC/OECD/IEA has also received valuable technical
input from a number of international workshops and IPCC Expert Group Meetings. The
overall purpose of these workshops was to provide a forum for experts to discuss ways
to improve the methodologies and reporting procedures and to ensure widespread
participation in the development process. Many of the recommendations received have
been incorporated into this revised Reference Manual.
In general, the basic approach to estimating national emissions is similar across the
various gases and human activities which are sources or sinks. Fundamentally, emissions
are a product of activity data and emission factors. In reality, these calculations are often
more complicated than this would indicate, with several steps being involved in the
calculation of each of the general terms - activity data and emission factors. But it is useful
to keep this general structure in mind as it provides an organising framework for all of
the calculations and a means of evaluation and comparison.
The Reference Manual frequently provides a number of different possible methodologies
or variations for calculating a given emission. In most cases these represent calculations of
the same form but the differences are in the level of detail at which the original
calculations are carried out. Wherever possible the methodology provides a "tiered"
structure of calculations which describes and connects the various levels of detail at which
national experts can work depending on the importance of the source category,
availability of data, and other capabilities. All national experts are encouraged to work at
the most detailed level which is possible and appropriate for their situation. The tiered
structure ensures that estimates calculated at a very detailed level can be aggregated up
to a common minimum level of detail for comparison with all other reporting countries.

The methodologies for the estimation of the emissions and removals of GHGs, which are
presented and discussed in the Guidelines, are grouped by the main activity sectors,
(chapters of this volume) namely, Energy, Industrial Processes, Solvent and Other Product Use,
Agriculture, Land Use Change and Forestry, and Waste.  In general, the source/sink activities
are unique to their sector but there are cases, e.g., biomass burning, which occur in
several sectors and are described in the chapters on Land-Use Change and Forestry, Energy
and Agriculture.
The chapters are divided by subject areas and correspond to the same subject chapters in
the Workbook. This document should be used by national experts as a reference tool to
accompany the Workbook and the Reporting Instructions when constructing and reporting
national inventories of GHG emissions and removals.
