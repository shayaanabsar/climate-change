Possible Approaches for Estimating 
Fluorinated Compounds Emissions from Textile, Carpet, Leather 
and Paper Industries: Basis for Future Methodological 
Development 
1A.1  Introduction 
Fluorine-based treatment of textiles for waterproofing was introduced in the 1950s (Davies 2014). The first 
microporous membrane (polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE, also known as Teflon™) was created in 1969 and the 
first GORE-TEX™ materials appeared on the market in 1976 (Williams 2018). Since then, fluorochemical 
finishes have been widely used to functionalize fibres for water or oil repellence, soil and stain release, 
improving textile breathability, softening, dyeing ability, increasing mechanical strength, providing antibacterial 
and anti-odour finishes, and for fabricating wrinkle-free materials (Choudhury 2017). Such applications are 
widespread for the production of home textiles, upholstery furniture, protective clothing with signal colour, tent 
canvas, outdoor wear, medical textiles and work wear such as uniforms and shoes (Lacasse & Baumann 2004; 
Schindler & Hauser 2004; Singha 2012; Gulrajani 2013; Roshan 2014). 
The conventional processes used for increasing the water repellence of fibres use perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids 
(PFCAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), commonly referred to as ‘C8’ chemistry because the 
precursor molecules contain 8 carbon atoms. Such processes can lead to the formation of Perfluoroalkylated acid 
through oxidation, and in particular to the environmental release of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), two chemicals of concern due their persistent and bio-accumulative nature. As a 
result, the use of C8 fluorinated polymers in textiles, carpet, leather, and paper has been restricted in some 
regions, and the industry is moving towards shorter chained chemistry (from ‘C8’ to ‘C6’ and ‘C4’). However, 
the C6 and C4 chemistries have been reported to perform more poorly than the conventional C8 chemistry 
(Davies 2014), and the C8 chemistry continues to be widely used in regions with large textile production 
capacities, particularly in developing countries (Fantke et al. 2015). Due to the lower performance of the shorter 
chained chemistry, alternate methods are being sought for the treatment of textile, carpet, leather and paper. In 
particular, plasma-based processes have shown promising performance (Davies 2014). 
Fluorine-based plasma treatment of textile, carpet, leather, and paper has received increased interest and has 
been a fertile subject for research and development (R&D) since the early 2000s, in part due to the fact that 
plasma technologies provide excellent performance and that plasma processes can be tailored to achieve many 
desirable properties. An increasing number of peer-reviewed papers have been published since 2006, and a 
growing number of patents have been filed worldwide in the last 5 to 8 years, indicating that technological and 
industrial developments are occurring rapidly in this emerging field. Several innovative treatment technologies 
and chemistries are now transitioning to industrial scale use, particularly plasma processing of textiles using 
gaseous fluorinated compounds (FC) such as CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F8, C5F10, CHF3, and SF6 (Yip et al. 2002; 
Hochart et al. 2003; Raffaele-Addamo et al. 2003; Davis et al. 2011; Kwong et al. 2013; Ramamoorthy et al. 
2013; Davies 2014; Zille et al. 2015; Saxena et al. 2017).  
As in the case of the electronics sector, plasma-based processes using fluorinated compounds in the textile 
industry are expected to result in emissions of unreacted fluorinated compounds and by-products with high 
global warming potentials (GWPs). However, the extent to which plasma processes have been introduced in 
volume manufacturing is not clear. Also, the wet application of fluorinated surfactants and fluorine-based 
polymers commonly used to treat textile, carpet, leather, and paper fibres can result in emissions of volatile 
fluorinated compounds through evaporative losses and cracking (IPPC 2003; OECD 2004). A list of the most 
important fluorinated compounds used for plasma-based treatment processes is provided in Table 1Ap.1, and a 
list of the most important fluorotelomers, fluorocarbons, and fluorosurfactants used for wet applications, as well 
as their vapour pressures, is provided in Table 1Ap.2. While the magnitude of FC emissions from the textile 
industry as compared to other sources of fluorinated greenhouse gases (GHGs) is presently unknown, it is clear 
that the textile industry contributes to some degree to the total amount of fluorinated substances found in the 
environment (KEMI 2014). 
Although several international and national reports refer to the possible off-gas emissions of fluorinated 
compounds into the atmosphere due to textile treatment, no emission factors appear to be available in the open 
literature to estimate greenhouse gas emissions from such processes (EPA 1997; Schönberger & Schäfer 2003; 
MoEU 2012; DEPA 2013; UNIDO et al. 2017). Only one reference about emissions of hydro-fluorocarbons 
related to the textile industry in the United Kingdom has be found in the literature (Ricardo-AEA 2015). As a

consequence, the authors were not able – at the time of writing of this second order draft – to estimate the 
volume of fluorinated compounds that are used or emitted by the textile, carpet, leather, and paper industries. 
Nevertheless, FC emissions in this sector could represent a significant new source, due to the large volume of 
substrates (i.e., product classes) treated and the sheer size and global nature of the industry. 
1A.1.1 
PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES 
Plasmas are frequently subdivided into thermal (hot) and non-thermal (cold) plasmas. For thermal plasmas, the 
temperature of electrons, ions, neutrals and excited species in the plasma state is in equilibrium, ranging from 
3,500 ºC to 20,000 ºC.  Non-equilibrium (cold) plasmas have electron temperatures that are much higher than the 
temperature of the ions and neutrals, where the temperature of the plasma is typically in the range of 40 to 250 
ºC. Because textiles and polymers cannot withstand the high temperatures used in thermal plasmas, most 
applications for organic fibres’ surface modification use cold plasmas. The majority of plasma-based textile 
treatment processes for the production of hydrophobic and oleophobic surfaces (but also for some polymer coating, 
flame retardant and medical antimicrobial fabrics) reported in the technical literature are based on non-thermal 
plasmas generated at low pressure (between 1 mTorr and 1 Torr) and in few cases at atmospheric pressure. Plasma 
source designs based on corona discharges, glow discharges, dielectric barrier discharges (DBDs), plasma jet, 
capacitively or inductively coupled discharges, and RF- or microwave-induced discharges have been studied 
(Sigurdsson & Shishoo 1997; Tendero et al. 2006; Morent et al. 2008; Sparavigna 2008; Jafari et al. 2013; Vietro 
et al. 2015; Zille et al. 2015; Gotoh et al. 2017).  
Although most plasma processing technologies for textile treatments are still at an emerging stage, several 
manufacturers have developed pilot- to commercial-scale machinery, and applications for specialized textiles 
have been or are currently being implemented at industrial scale. Indeed, plasma treatment proves particularly 
effective for the production of specialty textiles for the medical industry (gowns, masks, protective clothing), the 
automotive industry (seats, trim, headliners, airbags), the apparel industry (outer and under garments), the 
filtration industry (air, water filtration) and the flooring industry (carpet fibres) (Saxena et al. 2017). However, 
the high capital and operational costs of plasma treatment (in particular for low-pressure plasma technologies 
requiring a closed vacuum system) currently limits the commercial viability of the technique for treating 
conventional (non-specialized) fabrics. Polymerization of textiles using plasma at atmospheric pressure offers a 
low-cost and environmentally-friendly alternative, but the technology is still under development (Shishoo 2007; 
Muthu 2016). 
Plasma processes used for the treatment of such materials can be divided into three process types: 1) plasma 
treatment, 2) plasma etching (or ablation), and 3) plasma polymerization (Roth 2001). 
1) Plasma treatment uses inert gases such as Ar, He, N2, and chemically active molecules such as O2 or 
NH3, as well as fluorinated gases such as CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F8, C5F10, CHF3, SF6, and other (larger 
size) fluorine-containing molecules such as perfluoroalkyl acrylates (Tendero et al. 2006; Morent et al. 
2008; Sparavigna 2008; Jafari et al. 2013; Yim et al. 2013; Vietro et al. 2015; Zille et al. 2015; Gotoh et 
al. 2017). Plasma treatments can be further separated into two processes sub-types: a) when the plasma-
activated gases introduce chemical functionalities or create and deposit free radicals onto the target 
surface that can be subsequently used to cross-link or surface-graft other molecules to attain specific 
surface properties (very often more hydrophilic surfaces); or b) when the fabric is first immersed in a 
fluid of hydrophobic fluorinated pre-polymer with added initiators followed by a plasma treatment 
leading to the grafting of the pre-polymer on the surface of the fabric.  
2) Plasma etching is a process type where the substrate is bombarded with ions from the plasma. Three 
process sub-types may be defined within the etching process type, depending on whether plasma is used 
to a) clean, b) sterilize, or c) enhance surface adhesion of the fabrics. For example, dry plasma etching 
can be accomplished by using CF4 in a plasma discharge to create active species capable of reacting 
chemically with the layer to be etched (Sigurdsson & Shishoo 1997).  
3) Plasma polymerization is a process type where a monomer in vapour phase such as CF4, C2F6, C3F6, or 
larger fluorinated molecules such as fluorodecylacrylate is converted into reactive fragments to deposit 
a thin film onto the substrate. Plasma polymerization can be further separated into two process sub-
types: a) plasma-induced polymerization is when the polymerization process is a surface-based reaction 
and, b) plasma-state polymerization is when fragments react in the gas phase to form larger molecules 
that are then deposited on the substrate (Morent et al. 2008).  
For all process types and sub-types, it is highly improbable that all input chemicals are fully consumed in the process 
(IPCC 2006). Further, the plasma decomposition of input chemicals such as C2F6, C3F8, and larger chain fluorinated 
molecules is likely to result in the production of byproducts such as CF4, C2F6, CHF3 and other gases. Therefore, 
plasma-based fluorinated treatment of textile, carpet, leather, or paper is expected to lead to emissions of FC 
greenhouse gases. It should be noted that the potential for plasma-based polymerization processes to emit large 
Appendix 1: Basis for Future Methodological Development

amounts of FCs is likely lower than for the plasma treatment and plasma etching process types because, in the 
case of polymerization, the input FC chemicals are meant to react and form solid byproducts on the substrate as 
opposed to just treat or etch its surface. However, it should also be mentioned that plasma-based polymerization 
is more effective than many conventional wet-based chemistries, and that such characteristics may contribute to 
shifting emissions towards high-GWP gases. Finally, the extent to which reactor cleaning processes (to remove 
the deposits that build on the chamber walls after multiple depositions) may contribute to GHG emissions is 
unclear at the time of writing of the Second Order Draft of the 2019 Refinement, and comments are sought on 
this particular issue. 
1A.1.2 
WET TREATMENT PROCESSES 
Wet treatment processes include several application techniques but about 80per cent of the processes use the 
pad-dry-cure method, where the dry fabric is immersed in the finishing liquor and then squeezed between rollers 
before being dried and finally cured, usually at a temperature of between 150 and 180 ºC (Roshan 2014). Other 
techniques include vacuum extraction, spray applications, foam finishing, coating, and lamination.  
Side-chain fluorinated polymers primarily based on fluorotelomer acrylates, fluorotelomer methacrylates or per-
fluoroalkane sulfonamidoethanols characterize the chemical structure of the fluorine-based surfactants and 
polymers used for the above-described applications. Unfortunately, the environmental and health characteristics of 
the new short-chain chemistry and associated processes are poorly described in the scientific literature. Although 
some reports refer to possible emissions of FCs in the atmosphere due to textile-wet coating, no data or estimations 
of emissions are provided (IPPC 2003; Ellis et al. 2004; OECD 2004; Dumoulin et al. 2005; Prevedouros et al. 
2006; Barber et al. 2007; Jahnke et al. 2007; FOEN 2009; Young 2010; DEPA 2015; UNEP 2017). Data on the 
volatile PFASs that are emitted immediately after the production of textiles, the type of PFASs that can be formed 
by hydrolysis of the perfluorinated polymer side chains during use, washing and degradation of the fabrics is also 
seemingly missing.   
Importantly, it must be considered that FC products are likely to be released to the air during their industrial 
application to fibres, particularly during the curing phase of the treatment. It has been shown that, during the 
drying and curing phases, off-gas emissions can be produced by the volatility of the active substances themselves 
as well as by their constituents, which can contain on average 1per cent of unreacted and unbound residuals such 
as monomers, fluorotelomer alcohols (sometimes up to 6-8per cent of the dry weight) and perfluoroalkyl 
carboxylic acids (Heydebreck et al. 2016). Overall, it can be expected that the magnitude of emissions will 
depend on the drying or curing temperature, the substrate material, and the reagents’ volatility, concentrations 
and reactivity (European Commission 2003). To complicate the matter, there is a wide range of different 
application methods (e.g. padding, spray, foaming, coating, lamination, etc.), different vapour pressure of input 
chemicals, and different temperature and time of drying and curing steps of the treated substrates. For example, 
some leather stain resistant finishing agents are applied by spray and dried at room temperature while most of the 
textile finishing require a drying (110-130ºC) and curing (150-180 ºC) steps (Williams 2018). Carpet products 
may be cured at a lower temperature of 110 ºC while other products may be treated for 2 minutes at 170ºC or for 
30 seconds at 190ºC (e.g. cotton). Moreover, some carpet treatments require a curing step for water and oil 
repellence when using FCs deposition, but on the contrary no curing is required for some type of solvent soluble 
fluorinated soil release finishing agents for garments, upholstery and carpets (Goswami 2017). However, the 
latter kind of treatments has lower durability than water-based FCs because of the lack of fixation by 
crosslinking (Schindler & Hauser 2004). Generally, the higher the curing temperature, the shorter is the curing 
time in order to avoid yellowing of the fabric. Residuals and impurities may also be released directly from the 
products into the environment through volatilization, and FC emissions may result from the cracking of input 
chemicals. Thus, presumptively, emissions of high-GWP gases from wet-based fluorinated treatment of textile, 
leather, and paper fibres may represent a substantial source. However, the potential climate impact of such 
processes and substances does not appear to have been characterized in the literature, which typically focuses on 
formaldehyde, total organic carbon release and on a very limited selection of well-known long-chain PFASs 
such as perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and their precursors (Wang et al. 
2017).

1A.2  Methodological issues 
1A.2.1  
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The choice of method will eventually depend on the availability of measured emission factors from which 
default factors might be derived. The bibliographic research conducted as of the date of this Second Order Draft 
does not indicate that representative FC emissions data can be obtained from the textile, carpet, leather, or paper 
industries to derive default emission factors for Tier 1 or Tier 2 methods. Nevertheless, the authors propose 
herewith a four-tiered methodological framework (Tier 1, Tier 2a, Tier 2b, and Tier 3) to account for emissions 
from this sector. At this point, because no Tier 1 or Tier 2 default factors are available, only the Tier 3 method is 
practicable, using equipment-specific, process-specific, or site-specific measured emission factors. Distinct 
methods are provided for plasma-based processes and for wet-based processes. This Appendix provides a basis 
for future methodological development rather than complete guidance. 
The inventory methods proposed for plasma-based processes are analogous to those used in the electronics 
industry due to the similarity of the processes, and include four tiered methods (Tier 1, 2a, 2b, 3). The Tier 1 
method does not require gas consumption data and provides an estimate of emissions based on default (industry 
average) emission factors expressed in mass of FC emitted per unit area of substrate treated. The Tier 2a and 2b 
methods require FC consumption data at the site or national level and are based on process gas-specific default

emission factors expressed in terms of mass of FC emitted per mass of FC consumed (including both emissions 
of unreacted FC and emissions of all FC by-products formed during the process). For plasma processes, the 
difference between the Tier 2a and 2b methods is that the Tier 2b method differentiates emission factors by type 
of plasma process (plasma treatment, plasma etching, and plasma polymerization) and/or class of products 
manufactured (textiles, leather, paper, etc.), while the Tier 2a method does not. A Tier 3 method would use the 
same equations as the Tier 2b method, but would use measured emission factors (equipment-specific, process-
specific, substrate-specific, or site-specific) instead of default emission factors. 
For wet-based processes, a Tier 1 approach is proposed as a framework to estimate FC emissions based on the 
mass of substrate treated, a method, which would therefore not require data on the consumption of input 
chemicals. Two Tier 2 methods (Tier 2a and 2b) are also proposed as frameworks to report emissions based on 
default FC emission factors allowing to correlate the mass of wet input chemicals consumed to the mass of 
volatile by-products formed during the processes. The difference between the Tier 2a and 2b methods for wet 
processes is that the Tier 2b method would distinguish emission factors by process and/or substrate type (class of 
products) (see further discussion below), while the Tier 2a method would not. Finally, a Tier 3 method 
applicable to wet processes would use the same equations as the Tier 2b method, but would use measured 
emission factors (equipment-specific, process-specific, or site-specific) instead of default emission factors. 
Generally, the higher tiered methods will be more accurate than the lowered tiered ones, and using equipment-
specific, process-specific, or site-specific emission factors will improve accuracy and greatly reduce the 
uncertainty of emissions estimates. The accuracy of the methods using default emission factors depends, inter 
alia, on the differences between the emission factors of the processes actually used in production and the 
averaged (default) emission factors of a particular method, as well as on potential errors in allocating the 
consumption of input chemicals, and in reporting the abatement efficiency and the uptime of emissions control 
systems. With respect to uncertainty, the confidence level of a particular emissions estimate will likely be 
principally driven by the uncertainty of the default emission factors.  
1A.2.1.1  PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES 
Table 1Ap.3 depicts the information sources necessary for completing the tiered methods for estimating 
emissions from plasma treatment processes. This information is preliminary and likely to evolve as the 
definitions of the various methods are refined. At the time of writing of this Second Order Draft, no information 
about emission factors could be obtained for plasma treatments from the textile, carpet, leather, or paper 
industries to derive default emission factors for the Tier 1, Tier 2a, or Tier 2b methods. Thus, currently, the only 
practicable means to estimate emissions from this sector is the use of the Tier 3 method. Nevertheless, when a 
statistically-significant number of representative experimental emission factors becomes available, preliminary 
recommendations are provided for estimating default emission factors and for choosing the most appropriate 
Tier 1, Tier 2a, or Tier 2b methods.  
Depending on the method used, data based on production capacity (Tier 1), or data about input chemicals 
consumption, use rate, by-products formation rates, and the effectiveness of emissions control measures (Tier 2a, 
2b, 3) will be required for the calculation of emissions. For each variable, depending on the tiered method, an 
industry default value (D) may be used, measured (Me), or modelled (Mo) to account for site-specific values. 
With respect to accounting for emissions control technologies, the approach provided here is analogous to the 
method provided for the electronics industry. For more information, please refer to Chapter 6 “Electronic 
Industry Emissions”. 
While continuous (in-situ) emissions monitoring may be technically feasible, it is unclear whether such an 
approach could be an economically viable method to estimate emissions from the textile, carpet, leather, or paper 
industry. One alternate approach would be to measure emission factors during the development of new plasma 
processes when parameters such as input gas flows, chamber pressure, processing time, plasma power, etc. are 
adjusted for particular treatment needs or for manufacturing a particular product. Please see Box 1Ap.1 for 
guidance on the analytical methods that can be used for measuring emission factors. 
Another approach would be for facilities to periodically (for short periods of time) install equipment to measure 
emissions from their stacks for purposes of developing facility-specific emission factors to estimate emissions 
over the long term (see, e.g., the Tier 3b method developed for Chapter 6 “Electronic Industry Emissions”). It is 
very important to note that emission factors (i.e. input gas utilization efficiencies and by-product formation rates) 
can be strongly affected by changes in process variables (e.g. type of textile substrate material, pressure, 
temperature, plasma power, FC gas flow, processing time, etc.) and by the design of the process reactors. Thus, 
emission factors can substantially fluctuate from one tool manufacturer to another and for a recipe ‘tuned’ for a 
particular purpose or product.

TIER 1 METHOD FOR PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES – DEFAULT 
The Tier 1 method is the least accurate estimation method and should be used only in cases where site-specific 
data on the consumption of input chemicals are not available. The Tier 1 method, unlike the Tier 2a, 2b or Tier 3 
methods, is designed to give an aggregated estimate of FC emissions, although its methodology appears to 
produce gas-specific emissions. As envisioned, Tier 1 estimates would be made simultaneously for all (or for the 
most important) gases listed in Table 1Ap.1 and could only be used if reported as a complete set. 
As proposed, the Tier 1 calculation relies on a fixed set of generic emissions factors and does not account for 
differences among process types (plasma treatment, etching, or polymerization), individual processes or 
manufacturing tools. However, the members of the set would likely differ depending on the surface area of 
textile, carpet, leather, or paper products being manufactured. Each member of a set, which is a gas-specific 
emission factor, would express average emissions per unit of substrate area (textile, carpet, leather, paper) 
produced during manufacture.  
In using Tier 1, inventory compilers should not modify, in any way, the set of FCs assumed to represent average 
emissions. Further, as is common practice for IPCC methods, the Tier 1 method does not allow accounting for the 
use of emissions control technologies, and inventory compilers should not combine emissions estimated using 
Tier 1 method with emissions estimated using the Tier 2 or 3 methods. Neither may inventory compilers use, for 
example, the Tier 1 factor for CF4 to estimate the emissions of CF4 from textiles etching and combine it with the 
results of other FC gases from a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method. The formula used to calculate Tier 1 emissions is 
shown in Equation 1Ap.1.

TIER 2A METHOD FOR PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES – PROCESS 
CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
The Tier 2a method uses industry-wide default values for the fraction of input chemicals used in the plasma 
manufacturing process (Ui), the fraction of input chemicals i converted into FC by-products k during the process 
(Bk,i), and the fraction of  FC destroyed by the emissions control technology (Di). The Tier 2a method also 
calculates emissions for each input chemical used on the basis of site-specific data on chemicals consumption 
and emissions control technologies. Thus, to use the Tier 2a method, inventory compilers must have direct 
communication with industry (e.g., annual emissions reporting) to gather consumption data and ensure that 
emission control technologies are installed and used in accordance with the guidelines provided in this 
document. For the ‘heel’ or fraction of the purchased gas remaining in the shipping container after use (hi), 
facilities may use default or site-specific values.1 
Unlike the Tier 2b and Tier 3 methods that are explained later in this section, the Tier 2a method does not 
distinguish between process types (treatment, etching, or polymerization) or site-specific processes. However,

the Tier 2a default emission factors are formed separately for each input chemical, which, unlike the Tier 1 
method, allows to account for the actual mix of input chemicals used at a particular manufacturing site.  
Total Tier 2a emissions are equal to the sum of emissions from all unreacted fluorinated chemicals i used in the 
production process (Ei) plus emissions of all by-products k (BPEk) resulting from the conversion of all input 
chemicals used during production, as calculated using equations 1Ap.2, and 1Ap.3 below.

TIER 2B METHOD FOR PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES – PROCESS 
TYPE-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
The Tier 2b method is similar to the Tier 2a approach in the sense that it is based on chemical-specific default 
emission factors, but the Tier 2b factors also account for the type of plasma process and/or class of products (i.e. 
textile, carpet, leather, paper) used for production processes ‘p’. Thus, the Tier 2b approach is expected to be 
more accurate than the Tier 2a one because the Tier 2b method reflects the mix of processes or classes of 
products used in a particular manufacturing facility. Also, the Tier 2b method allows to account for the trend 
where some chemicals tend to be used predominantly in particular process types and class of products 
manufactured. The Tier 2b method uses industry-wide default values for the fraction of input chemicals i used in 
plasma production process p (Ui,p), the fraction of input chemicals i converted into FC by-products k during 
process p (Bk,i,p), and the fraction of  FC destroyed by the emissions control technology connected to tools using 
production process p (Di,p). For the ‘heel’ or fraction of the purchased gas remaining in the shipping container 
after use (hi), facilities may use default or site-specific values.3 
Although the Tier 2b method is preferred over the Tier 2a method because process- or product-type specific 
emission factors are more accurate, it should be noted that the Tier 2b method presents increased complexity 
because the consumption of input chemicals must be allocated to each production process p. Thus, in the case 
where the consumption of input chemicals cannot directly be measured for each production process p, a gas 
consumption allocation model must be devised for applying the method, 4 and inventory compilers should 
consider the trade-off of using more accurate process-specific emission factors versus introducing errors in the 
Tier 2b estimate, due to uncertainties in the allocation model. 
Total Tier 2b emissions are equal to the sum of emissions from all unreacted fluorinated chemicals i used in all 
production processes p (Ei) plus emissions of all by-products k resulting from the conversion of all input 
chemicals used during all production processes p (BPEk), as calculated using equations 1AP.6, and 1AP.7 below.  
                                                           
 
2 For determining the amount of tool operating time, you may assume that tools that were installed for the whole of the year 
were operated for 525,600 minutes per year. For tools that were installed or uninstalled during the year, you should prorate 
the operating time to account for the days in which the tool was not installed; treat any partial day that a tool was installed 
as a full day (1,440 minutes) of tool operation. For an abatement system that has more than one connected tool, the tool 
operating time is 525,600 minutes per year if at least one tool was installed at all times throughout the year. If you have 
tools that are idle with no gas flow through the tool for part of the year, you may calculate total tool time using the actual 
time that gas is flowing through the tool.

TIER 3 METHOD FOR PLASMA TREATMENT PROCESSES – SITE-
SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
The Tier 3 method uses the same set of equations (equations 1Ap.6 to 1Ap.9) as the Tier 2b method. However, 
when using the Tier 3 method, inventory compilers need to interpret ‘p’ in these equations as a specific 
production process using a specific ‘recipe’. A recipe corresponds to a particular combination of input gases 
under specific conditions of process duration, temperature, pressure, flow, plasma power, class or product, and 
other relevant process parameters adjusted to achieve a particular result (i.e. water or stain resistance, increased 
mechanical strength, etching medical polyamide, etc.) on a specific process reactor. It is very important to note 
that emission factors such as input gas utilisation efficiencies and by-product formation rates can be strongly 
affected by changes in process parameters (duration, temperature, pressure, flow, plasma power, reactor design, 
etc.). 
When using the Tier 3 method, the (1-U) and BPE emission factors in Equations 1.Ap.6 and 1.Ap.7 should be 
measured for specific processes recipes. However, a centreline process recipe may be used to establish Tier 3 
emission factors for sets of ‘similar’ recipes. Recipes can be deemed ‘similar’ when the centreline process can 
reasonably be deemed representative of facility-specific process conditions, of the potential variability of such 
process conditions around the centreline process during normal manufacturing operations, and when the process 
type (plasma treatment, plasma etching, and plasma polymerization), product, process tool, and input process 
gases are the same. When using the concept of ‘similarity’, inventory compilers should be able to reasonably 
demonstrate that emissions estimates are not biased (i.e. systematically over- or under-estimated) when using 
centreline process recipe(s) emission factors.  
Once default Tier 2a or Tier 2b emission factors will be developed, the Tier 3 method should be used by 
manufacturing plants whose processes and recipes depart significantly from industry-wide patterns of use (e.g. 
for facilities using an input chemical primarily in plasma etching while others primarily use it in plasma 
polymerization), or by manufacturing plants that may have developed specific processes whose characteristics 
may result in a significantly lower or higher utilization of input chemicals or formation of byproducts. Further, if

default Tier 2 emission factors are not available for a particular process or input chemical, manufacturing 
facilities should measure their site-specific emission factors and use the Tier 3 method. 
It should also be noted that Tier 3 emission factors could be combined with Tier 2a or 2b default emission 
factors (once available) to use a hybrid method. A hybrid method would involve applying the Tier 2 defaults to 
processes and technologies that have not changed while applying Tier 3a, site-specific emission factors to 
processes and technologies that have changed. Indeed, higher accuracy might be achieved by using the Tier 3 
method for specific input chemicals or site-specific processes. However, inventory compilers should not 
combine the Tier 1 method with any other method. 
The Tier 3 method is not outlined further in this Appendix, but inventory compilers should refer to the Box 
1Ap.1 on specific technologies for the measurement of FC emissions in order to develop facility- or country-
specific emission factors as a resource for implementing the Tier 3 method. Also, measurement methods 
developed for the electronics industry could be used as a basis for measuring emission factors from plasma-
based finishing processes in the textile, carpet, leather, and paper industries (Benaway et al. 2014). 
 
BOX 1AP.1 
ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR MEASURING FC EMISSIONS  
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is the currently preferred option due to part per 
billion (ppb) sensitivity, portability, ability to enable near-real-time measurements, reprocess 
historical data, and provide multi-component analysis and resistance to magnetic fields. However, 
FTIRs are generally considered to be higher-cost systems, requiring significant upkeep during 
sampling campaigns. Depending on the absorptivity and concentration of the FC gases to be 
detected, FTIR gas cells with long path lengths (meters) might be required to reach suitable 
detection levels (Espinoza-Nava et al. 2016). 
Gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can provide a near real time 
measurement of FC, as well as several other gas sample components if desired. The instrument 
must be calibrated in place, prior to the start of FC monitoring. If GC/MS measurement is not 
possible on a continuous basis this technology allows for sample collection that can be transported 
to a laboratory for analysis, directly in sample bags or by desorbing components after time average 
sampling onto sorbent columns. Using samples in bags or metal canisters, detection limits of 0.05 
ppmv and 0.04 ppmv for CF4 and C2F6, respectively, can be achieved. Using the sorbent columns 
detection limits of 9 ppbv for CF4 and 0.6 ppbv for C2F6 have been validated (EPA & IAI 2008). 
Detection limits can be improved with modification of desorption parameters if desired. Method 
Detection Limit (MDL) from 0.001 to 3.5 pg.m-3 were reported for indoor and outdoor 
determination of several volatile perfluorinated compounds with the use of high volume samples 
and efficient enrichment steps (Trojanowicz & Koc 2013). 
 
1A.2.1.2  WET TREATMENT PROCESSES 
Table 1Ap.4 depicts the information sources necessary for completing the tiered methods for estimating 
emissions from wet-based treatment of textiles, carpet, leather, and paper. This information is preliminary and 
likely to evolve, as the definitions of the various methods are refined. At the time of writing of this Second Order 
Draft, no information about emission factors could be obtained for wet-based treatments from the textile, carpet, 
leather, or paper industries to derive default emission factors for the Tier 1, Tier 2a, or Tier 2b methods. Thus, 
currently, the only practicable means to estimate emissions from this sector is the use of the Tier 3 method. 
Nevertheless, when a statistically-significant number of representative experimental emission factors become 
available, preliminary recommendations are provided for estimating default emission factors and for choosing 
the most appropriate Tier 1, Tier 2a, or Tier 2b methods.  
Depending on the method used, data based on production capacity (Tier 1), or data about input chemicals 
consumption, use rate, by-products formation rates, and the effectiveness of emissions control measures (Tier 2a, 
2b, 3) will be required for the calculation of emissions. For each variable, depending on the method, an industry 
default value (D) may be used, modelled (Mo), or measured (Me) to account for site-specific values. As 
mentioned earlier, emissions of greenhouse gases from wet treatment processes may result from evaporative 
losses of the input liquid chemicals and from the formation of volatile fluorinated compounds through chemical 
reactions during the processes, all of which can be considered volatile by-product emissions resulting from the 
use of the liquid input chemicals. Thus, unlike for plasma-based processes, the equations for the Tier 2a, 2b and 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
Ap1.14 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
 
Tier 3 methods for wet treatment processes do not take into account the utilization efficiency of the input liquid 
chemicals – most of which remain on the substrate as a coating (in a solid state), and only volatile by-product 
emission factors are necessary to account for all emissions (EVi and Bk,i for the Tier 2a and EVi,p and Bk,i,p for the 
Tier 2b and Tier 3 methods). Also, the equations for wet treatment processes do not include a heel factor 
(fraction of gas remaining in the shipping container in the methods used for plasma-based processes). The 
emission factors for textile industry will be calculated for the emission potential of auxiliaries to the produced 
amount of textile in kg.6 
While continuous (in-situ) emissions monitoring may be technically feasible, it is unclear whether such approach 
could be an economically viable method to estimate emissions from the textile, carpet, leather, or paper industry. 
One alternate approach would be to measure emission factors during the development of new wet-based 
processes when parameters such as coating velocity, liquid ratio, processing time, curing and dying 
temperatures, etc. are adjusted for particular treatment needs or for a particular product. Please see Box 1Ap.1 
for guidance on the analytical methods than can be used for measuring emission factors.  
Another approach would be for facilities to periodically (for short periods of time) install equipment to measure 
emissions from their stacks for purposes of developing facility-specific emission factors to estimate emissions 
over the long term. It is very important to note that emission factors (i.e. input liquid utilization efficiencies and 
by-product formation rates) can be strongly affected by changes in process variables (e.g. type of textile 
substrate material, curing temperature, liquid ratio, used chemical, processing time, etc.) and by the design of the 
process equipment. Thus, emission factors can substantially fluctuate from one tool manufacturer to another and 
for a recipe ‘tuned’ for a particular purpose or product.

preparation, dyeing, printing or finishing to be carried out more effectively or which is essential if a given effect is to be

TIER 1 METHOD FOR WET PROCESSES – DEFAULT 
The Tier 1 method is the least accurate estimation method and should be used only in cases where site-specific 
data on the consumption of input chemicals are not available. The Tier 1 method, unlike the Tier 2a, 2b or Tier 3 
methods, is designed to give an aggregated estimate of FC emissions although its methodology appears to 
produce gas-specific emissions. As envisioned, Tier 1 estimates would be made simultaneously for all (or for the 
most important) gases listed in Tables 1Ap.1 and 1Ap.2 and can only be used if reported as a complete set.  
As proposed, the Tier 1 calculation relies on a fixed set of generic emissions factors and does not account for 
differences among process and substrate types, individual processes or manufacturing tools. However, the 
members of the set would likely differ depending on the surface area of textile, carpet, leather, or paper products 
being manufactured. Each member of a set, which is a gas-specific emission factor, would express average 
emissions per unit of substrate area (textile, carpet, leather, paper) produced during manufacture.  
For any class of product, the factors (members of the set) are multiplied by the annual capacity utilization (Cu, a 
fraction) and the annual manufacturing design capacity (Cd, in kg) of substrate processes. The product (Cu • Cd) 
is an estimate of the quantity of substrate produced during the manufacture of textile, carpet, leather, or paper. 
The result is a set of annual emissions expressed in kg of the volatile by-products that comprise the set for each 
class of products. The Tier 1 formula is shown in Equation 1Ap.10. 
In using Tier 1, inventory compilers should not modify, in any way, the set of the FC assumed to represent 
average emissions. Further, as is common practice for IPCC methods, the Tier 1 method does not allow to account 
for the use of emissions control technologies, and inventory compilers should not combine emissions estimated 
using Tier 1 method with emissions estimated using the Tier 2 or 3 methods. Neither may inventory compilers 
use, for example, the Tier 1 factor for 1,1,2,2-Tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether to estimate the emissions of 1,1,2,2-
Tetrafluoroethyl methyl ether from pad-dry-cure textiles and combine it with the results of other FC gases from a 
Tier 2 or Tier 3 method. The formula used to calculate Tier 1 emissions is shown in Equation 1Ap.10.

TIER 2A METHOD FOR WET TREATMENT PROCESSES – PROCESS 
CHEMICAL-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
The Tier 2a method uses industry-wide default values for the ratio of the mass of chemical i evaporated divided 
by the mass of chemical i used (EVi), the mass fraction of volatile by-product k formed from the use of liquid 
input chemical i (Bk,i), the liquor concentration (Ci), the liquor pick-up (Li), the fraction of input chemical i used 
in the wet-based manufacturing process (Di) and the fraction of  FC by-products k destroyed by the emissions 
control technology (Dk). The Tier 2a method also calculates emissions for each input chemical used on the basis 
of site-specific data on chemicals consumption and emissions control technologies. Thus, to use the Tier 2a 
method, inventory compilers must have direct communication with industry (e.g., annual emissions reporting) to 
gather consumption data and ensure that emission control technologies are installed and used in accordance with 
the guidelines provided in this document. Unlike the Tier 2b and Tier 3 methods that are explained later in this 
section, the Tier 2a method does not distinguish between process or substrate types, or site-specific processes. 
However, the Tier 2a default emission factors are formed separately for each input chemical, which, unlike the 
Tier 1 method, allows to account for the actual mix of input chemicals used at a particular site. Total Tier 2a

emissions are equal to the sum of emissions from evaporative losses of unreacted fluorinated chemicals i in the

TIER 2B METHOD FOR WET PROCESSES – PROCESS / SUBSTRATE 
SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
The Tier 2b method is similar to the Tier 2a approach in the sense that it is based on chemical-specific default 
emission factors, but the Tier 2b factors also account for the types of wet processes and/or classes of products. 
For the definition of ‘p’ compilers should refer to Box 1AP.2 Thus, the Tier 2b approach is expected to be more 
accurate than the Tier 2a one because the Tier 2b method reflects the type of processes used or products made in 
a particular manufacturing facility. Also, the Tier 2b method allows to account for the trend where some 
chemicals tend to be used predominantly in particular process types or products manufactured. The Tier 2b 
method uses industry-wide default values for the ratio of the mass of chemical i evaporated divided by the mass 
of chemical i used during process type or product type p (EVi,p), the for the mass fraction of volatile FC by-
product k formed from the use of input chemical i per mass of substrate in process type or product type p (Bk,i,p), 
the liquor concentration (Ci,p) for substrate in process type or product type p, the liquor pick-up (Li,p) for 
substrate in process type or for product type p, the fraction of input chemical i used in the wet-based 
manufacturing process using process type or product type p and the fraction of chemical i evaporated or FC by-
products k destroyed by the emissions control technology connected to tools using process type or product type p 
(Di,p and Dk,p). 
 
                                                           
 
7 For determining the amount of tool operating time, you may assume that tools that were installed for the whole of the year 
were operated for 525,600 minutes per year. For tools that were installed or uninstalled during the year, you should prorate 
the operating time to account for the days in which the tool was not installed; treat any partial day that a tool was installed 
as a full day (1,440 minutes) of tool operation. For an abatement system that has more than one connected tool, the tool 
operating time is 525,600 minutes per year if at least one tool was installed at all times throughout the year. If you have 
tools that are idle with no gas flow through the tool for part of the year, you may calculate total tool time using the actual 
time that gas is flowing through the tool.

BOX 1AP.2 
APPROACHES FOR DERIVING THE TIER 2B EMISSION FACTORS AND DEFINING ‘P’  
Two approaches are proposed. A first approach would be to provide separate Tier 2b emission 
factors depending on the actual wet treatment method used in the process. In this case, default EFs 
would be provided for process types such as wet finishing (e.g. pad-dry-cure and exhaust 
applications), low wet pickup finish applications (e.g. vacuum extraction and kiss roll), spray 
application, foam finishing, coating, and lamination.  
Another approach would be to provide separate Tier 2b emission factors based on the type of 
product manufactured. In this case, default EFs would be provided for substrate types such as 
cellulosic and regenerated cellulosic textiles (cotton, viscose, rayon, etc.), synthetic polymers for 
textile (polyamides, polyesters, polypropylenes, polyurethane), lignocellulosic (flax, jute, sisal, 
etc.), protein-based textiles (wool, silk), leather, paper and paperboard, and technical textile 
polymers.  
The information currently available is insufficient to determine which of the two approaches above 
(or a combination thereof) might be most suitable, or if separate methods should be provided to 
distinguish EFs by process type (a separate Tier 2b method) and by product type (an additional 
Tier 2c method). Further discussion is required on this point, and an analysis of how emission 
factors may be grouped based on different treatment process conditions (temperature, timing, type 
of chemicals used, etc.) should be conducted. Nevertheless, the Tier 2b methodological framework 
proposed here could be adapted to the (to be determined) best approach. 
 
Although the Tier 2b method is preferred over the Tier 2a method because process-type-specific or product-type-
specific emission factors are more accurate, it should be noted that the Tier 2b method presents increased 
complexity because the consumption of input chemicals must be allocated to each process or product type p. 
Thus, in the case where the consumption of input chemicals cannot directly be measured for each process type or 
product type p, a chemical consumption allocation model must be devised for applying the method, 8 and 
inventory compilers should consider the trade-off of using more accurate process-specific or product-specific 
emission factors versus introducing errors in the Tier 2b estimate, due to uncertainties in the allocation model. 
Total Tier 2b emissions are equal to the sum of emissions from evaporative losses of unreacted fluorinated 
chemicals i used in all production processes p (Ei) plus emissions of all by-products k (BPEk) resulting from the 
conversion of all input chemicals i used during the production of process types or substrate types p, as calculated 
using equations 1Ap.15, and 1Ap.16 below.

TIER 3 METHOD FOR WET PROCESSES – SITE-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS 
The Tier 3 method uses the same set of equations (equations 1Ap.15 to 1Ap.18) as the Tier 2b method. However, 
when using the Tier 3 method, inventory compilers need to interpret ‘p’ in these equations as a specific 
production process using a specific ‘recipe’. A recipe corresponds to a particular combination of input liquids 
under specific conditions of process duration, temperature, type of substrate, and other relevant process 
parameters adjusted to achieve a particular result (e.g. water or stain resistance). It is very important to note that 
emission factors and by-product formation rates can be strongly affected by changes in process parameters 
(temperature, flows and nature of input chemicals, processing time, etc.). 
When using the Tier 3 method, BPE emission factors in Equation 1Ap.16 should be measured for specific 
processes recipes. However, a centreline process recipe may be used to establish Tier 3 emission factors for sets 
of ‘similar’ recipes. Recipes can be deemed ‘similar’ when the centreline process can reasonably be deemed 
representative of facility-specific process conditions, of the potential variability of such process conditions 
around the centreline process during normal manufacturing operations, and when the substrate, process type, 
product, process tool, and input process gases are the same. When using the concept of ‘similarity’, inventory 
compilers should be able to reasonably demonstrate that emissions estimates are not biased (i.e. systematically 
over- or under-estimated) when using centreline process recipe(s) emission factors.  
Once default Tier 2a or Tier 2b emission factors will be developed, the Tier 3 method should be used by 
manufacturing plants whose processes and recipes depart significantly from industry-wide patterns of use, or by 
manufacturing plants that may have developed specific processes whose characteristics may result in a 
significantly lower or higher utilization of input chemicals or formation of by-products. Further, if default Tier 2 
emission factors are not available for a particular process or input chemical, manufacturing facilities should 
measure their site-specific emission factors and use the Tier 3 method. 
It should also be noted that Tier 3 emission factors could be combined with Tier 2a or 2b default emission 
factors (once available) to use a hybrid method. A hybrid method would involve applying the Tier 2 defaults to 
processes and technologies that have not changed while applying Tier 3a, site-specific emission factors to 
processes and technologies that have changed. Indeed, higher accuracy might be achieved by using the Tier 3 
method for specific input chemicals or site-specific processes. However, inventory compilers should not 
combine the Tier 1 method with any other method.  
The Tier 3 method is not outlined further in this Appendix, but inventory compilers should refer to the Box 
1.Ap.1 on specific technologies for the measurement of FC emissions in order to develop facility- or country-
specific emission factors as a resource for implementing the Tier 3 method.  
1A.3  Choice of emission factors  
At the moment no representative FC emissions data can be obtained for textile, carpet, leather and paper 
industries to derive the Tier 1 or Tier 2 default emission factors. Thus, the Tier 3 methods is the only practical 
means to estimate emissions from this sector, where individual manufacturing sites will have to use measured 
emission factors (equipment-specific, process-specific, or site-specific). In this case, applying the Tier 3 methods 
and reporting emission factors across representative manufacturing sites will become essential in building a 
database of emission factors that can later be used to derive the Tier 1 and Tier 2 emission factors. Countries are 
encouraged to develop country-specific emission factors based on surveys of representative subsets of sources. 
Countries are also encouraged to work with equipment manufacturers and users of such equipment to measure 
                                                           
 
9 For determining the amount of tool operating time, you may assume that tools that were installed for the whole of the year 
were operated for 525,600 minutes per year. For tools that were installed or uninstalled during the year, you should prorate 
the operating time to account for the days in which the tool was not installed; treat any partial day that a tool was installed 
as a full day (1,440 minutes) of tool operation. For an abatement system that has more than one connected tool, the tool 
operating time is 525,600 minutes per year if at least one tool was installed at all times throughout the year. If you have 
tools that are idle with no gas flow through the tool for part of the year, you may calculate total tool time using the actual 
time that gas is flowing through the tool.

equipment-specific, process-specific, or site-specific emission factors, with the aim of developing representative 
default emission factors that could eventually be used for site-specific, domestic, or industry-wide inventories. It 
is good practice to clearly and transparently document such emission factors. To support development of 
representative default emission factors, inventory compilers are encouraged to submit measurements of emission 
factors to the IPCC Emission Factor Database (EFDB). 
 
1A.4  Choice of activity data 
Activity data for the textile, carpet, leather and paper industries consist of data on gas or finishing agent 
sales/purchases and/or production figures (surface area or kg of substrate used during the textile treatments). For 
plasma and wet-based treatments the more data-intensive Tier 2 and Tier 3 methods, gas consumption and 
finishing agent data at the company or plant-level are necessary. The preferred methodologies for data collection 
are described in Box 1Ap.1. For Tiers 2 and 3, countries should create a national textile industry database with 
relevant data or information on textile companies, types of production/treatment, annual production data, 
consumption of chemicals and other relevant parameters. For the Tier 1 methods, inventory compilers will need 
to determine the total surface area of textile substrates treated during the reporting year for plasma or the mass of 
textile substrates treated for wet-based processes in the reporting year. The best sources of either gas/finishing 
agent usage data or substrate area per kg data are the owners and operators of the textile manufacturing facilities 
in each country. 
1A.5  Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce equipment-specific, process-
specific or site-specific emission factors and national emission inventory estimates as outlined in Volume 1, 
Section 6.11. The inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source data such that 
the reported emission estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. It is suggested that 
any inventory value outside the 95 percent confidence range of the data population variance be confirmed with 
the data source. Use of standard measurement methods improves the consistency of the resulting data and 
knowledge of the statistical properties of the data. Large differences should be explained and documented. In 
addition, the methods applied and references should be documented. It is good practice to conduct quality 
control checks and quality assurance procedures as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. Inventory compilers are 
encouraged to use higher tier Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. Transparent reporting of emissions factors will be required to ensure that representative 
default emission factors can be derived. Efforts to increase transparency should also take into account the 
protection of confidential business information related to specific gases or finishing agents used.
