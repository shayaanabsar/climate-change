Overview
This chapter discusses inventory methods for emissions of SO2 and direct and indirect
greenhouse gases from energy sources, comprising CO2, CH4, N2O, NOx, CO and
NMVOC.  Energy systems are extremely complex and widespread components of
national economies.  The full range of greenhouse gases is emitted from the production,
transformation, handling and consumption of energy commodities.  Chapter 2, Industrial
Processes, discusses emissions which arise jointly from fuel use in industrial processes and
provides guidance on attributing the emissions to the energy or industrial process
categories.  The various emissions from energy systems are organised in two main
categories:  Emissions from Fuel Combustion and Fugitive Emissions.
Emissions from Fuel Combustion
CO2  emissions from fuel combustion are discussed separately and in some depth because
they can be calculated accurately at a highly aggregated level, unlike other gases.  CO2
emissions are primarily dependent on the carbon content of the fuel.  The IPCC
Reference Approach for CO2 emissions is a simple, accurate and internationally
transparent approach which takes advantage of this fact.
CO2 from energy activities can be estimated from energy supply data, with a few
adjustments such as for carbon non-oxidised.  Supply data for all commercial fuels are
available from international data bases covering individual countries of the world.  These
data, together with typical carbon content figures, provide a sound starting point for the
estimation of CO2 inventories, particularly for global or regional studies.  However,
because fuel qualities and emission factors may differ markedly between countries,
sometimes by as much as ten percent for nominally similar fuels, national inventories
should be prepared using local emission factors and energy data where possible.
Unlike CO2, national inventories of CH4, N2O, NOx, CO and NMVOCs require more
detailed information.  Accurate estimation of their emissions depends on knowledge of
several interrelated factors, including combustion conditions, technology, and emission
control policies, as well as fuel characteristics.  The methods must, in general, be applied
at a detailed activity/technology level.  CO2 emissions may also be calculated at the more
detailed level required for other gases.  Indeed, when calculating non-CO2 emissions
national experts are encouraged to calculate CO2 emissions at the same time, as
reconciliation of total CO2 emissions estimated in this manner with those obtained from
the Reference Approach provides a valuable verification process.  Procedures for
estimating CO2 and non-CO2 emissions at the detailed or more aggregated levels of
activity are presented in this chapter.  The methods for estimating the gases are divided in
“Tiers” encompassing different levels of activity and technology detail.  Tier 1 methods
are generally very simple requiring less data and expertise than the most complicated
Tier 3 methods.
Fugitive Emissions
In addition to the emission of greenhouse gases from fuel combustion, other emissions into the
atmosphere occur in an unplanned or a deliberate manner.  These are fugitive emissions.
Fugitive emissions are intentional or unintentional releases of gases from anthropogenic
activities.  In particular, they may arise from the production, processing, transmission,
storage and use of fuels, and include emissions from combustion only where it does not

support a productive activity (e.g., flaring of natural gases at oil and gas production
facilities).  The most significant greenhouse gas emissions in this category are methane
emissions from coal mining and from oil and gas systems.  There are also emissions of other
gases, such as CO2 and NMVOCs as fugitive or by-product emissions from energy systems.

As part of Phase II of the IPCC/OECD/IEA Programme on National Greenhouse Gas
(GHG) Inventories an expert group on GHG Emissions from Fuel Combustion was set
up.  The group included over forty experts from various geographical and professional
backgrounds.  The terms of reference of this group were to continue improving the
estimation methodologies on emissions from fuel combustion which had been published in
the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Inventories in March 1995.
The issues addressed by the group can be divided into several broad areas:
•
harmonisation of international emission estimation methodologies and reporting;
•
improvement and review of emission factors;
•
development of a new Tier 1 method for estimating non-CO2 GHG and SO2
emissions based on fuel consumption;
•
development of a new Tier 2 method for estimating emissions from aircraft.
In addition the group identified areas for further work.  These are listed at the end of this
chapter.
The results of the group’s work on the final three items listed above are contained in the
sections which follow.  The experts’ conclusions following a review and discussion of the
harmonisation of methodologies are summarised in the following statement.
Harmonisation of International Emission Estimation Methodologies and
Reporting
Two approaches to drawing up and presenting national emission inventories in
comparable form are  currently in use:
•
The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and
•
the joint EMEP/CORINAIR Atmospheric Emission Inventory Guidebook.
Countries which are Parties to both Conventions have to apply both reporting
procedures to each Convention.  The IPCC approach meets FCCC needs for calculating
national totals (without further spatial resolution) and identifying sectors within which
emissions occur, whereas the EMEP/CORINAIR approach is technology based and
includes spatial allocation of emissions (point and area sources).
Both systems follow the same basic principles :
•
complete coverage of anthropogenic emissions (CORINAIR also considers natural
emissions);
•
annual source category totals of national emissions;
•
clear distinction between energy and non-energy related emissions;
•
transparency and full documentation permitting detailed verification of activity data
and emission factors.

1.3
To date, considerable progress has been made in the harmonisation of the IPCC and
EMEP/CORINAIR approaches.  The IPCC Expert Group on Fuel Combustion has made
changes to the fuel list and to the source/sink categories to allow more direct comparison
of the two approaches:
•
Biomass fuels will be allocated to the various source categories (CO2 from biomass
will not be reported in national totals).
•
In order to estimate the full emissions of the industry sector, emissions from
autoproduction should be included with emissions from other fuel use within
industry.  At the same time the emissions from the autoproduction of electricity and
heat should be excluded from the energy transformation source category to avoid
double counting.  This change brings the IPCC source categories for manufacturing
and transformation industries into line with those used by CORINAIR.
•
Treatment of evaporative emissions (NMVOC) from road transport in the IPCC
Tier 2 method is consistent with CORINAIR.  Combustion and evaporative
emissions should be reported separately.  In the IPCC Tier 1 method, all emissions
from road transport are included together under fuel combustion.
The CORINAIR programme has now developed its approach further to include additional
sectors and sub-divisions (e.g. the definition of civil aviation is now in line with the IPCC
definition) so that a complete CORINAIR inventory, including emission estimates, can be
used to produce reports in both the FCCC/IPCC or EMEP/CORINAIR reporting formats
for submission to their respective Conventions.  Minor adjustments based on additional
local knowledge may be necessary to complete such reports for submission.
One difference  between the approaches remains:
•
Spatial allocation of road transport emissions: here CORINAIR, with a view to the
input requirements of atmospheric dispersion models, applies the principle of
territoriality (emission allocation according to fuel consumption) whereas the IPCC
is bound to the principle of political responsibility (allocation according to fuel sale).
For the IPCC, countries with a big disparity between emissions from fuel sales and
fuel consumption have the option of estimating true consumption and reporting the
emissions from consumption and trade separately.  However, national totals must be
on the basis of fuel sales.

In addition to this introduction, this chapter is organised into four separate substantive
sections covering fuel combustion and fugitive emissions:
•
Simple Methods (Tier 1): Emissions from all sources of combustion are estimated
on the basis of the quantities of fuel consumed and average emission factors.  The
IPCC Reference Approach for CO2 is presented together with new methods for the
estimation of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions from the main source categories.
•
Detailed Methods (Tiers 2/3): Emission estimations are based on detailed
fuel/technology information covering stationary and mobile sources.
•
Fugitive emissions from coal mining and handling: Emissions are generated as
a result of the mining and handling of coal, primarily methane emissions from coal
mining.  Other emissions of GHGs from coal mine and waste fires are briefly
discussed.

Fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas activities: Methane emissions
from natural gas flaring and venting, and from natural gas production, transmission
and distribution are the most important for this category.  CO2 emissions from
venting and flaring are included as are NMVOC emissions from production,
processing and distribution of oil and oil products.  A new section briefly describes
the estimation of emissions of ozone precursors and SO2 from refineries.

Data
1 . 2 . 1 D a t a  S o u r c e s
Activity Data
Subject to the requirements outlined below and intended to ensure the comparability of
country inventories, the IPCC approach to the calculation of emission inventories
encourages the use of fuel statistics collected by an officially recognised national body, as
this is usually the most appropriate and accessible activity data.  In some countries,
however, those charged with the task of compiling inventory information may not have
ready access to the entire range of data available within their country and may wish to
use data specially provided by their country to the international organisations whose
policy functions require knowledge of energy supply and use in the world.
There are, currently, two main sources of international energy statistics: the International
Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD/IEA), and the United Nations (UN).  The primary energy data sources cited in
this report include:
•
From the OECD/IEA:  Energy Statistics and Balances of Non-OECD Countries
(OECD/IEA, 1996b); Energy Balances of OECD Countries (OECD/IEA, 1996a); and
Energy Statistics of OECD Countries (OECD/IEA, 1996c).
•
From the United Nations: Energy Statistics Yearbook (UN, 1996).
Both international organisations collect energy data from the national administrations of
their member countries through systems of questionnaires.  The data gathered are
therefore “official” data.  To avoid duplication of reporting, where countries are members
of both organisations, the UN receives copies of the IEA questionnaires for the OECD
member countries rather than requiring these countries to complete the UN
questionnaires.  When compiling its statistics of non-OECD member countries the IEA,
for certain countries, uses UN data to which it may add additional information obtained
from the national administration, consultants or energy companies operating within the
countries.  Statistics for other countries are obtained directly from national sources.  The
number of countries covered by the IEA publications is fewer than that of the UN. 1
Emission Factors
Emissions of GHGs from fuel combustion and fuel supply activities are calculated by
multiplying levels of activity by emission factors usually expressed as mass of pollutant per
                                                  
     1 Approximately 130 countries (of about 170 UN Member countries) are included in
the IEA data, but the countries it includes account for about 98 per cent of worldwide
energy consumption and nearly all energy production.

energy unit of activity (e.g. kg N2O/TJ).  The most commonly used activity measure for
energy-related emissions is the amount of fuel burned or, where fugitive emissions are
concerned, the amount of fuel produced or distributed.  In some cases other measures of
activity are used, most notably in calculating emissions from the transport sector.
A number of international and national sources of energy activity data and industry
emission factors exist largely as a result of international and national analyses of
alternative control policies for SOx, NOx and NMVOC.  A few sources have also recently
emerged on various other GHGs.  The more detailed factors (for gases other than CO2)
do not relate directly to national energy activity data described below, but require some
additional information.  The sources of emission factor data, and procedures for making
these linkages are discussed in the context of specific gases and source types, in the
relevant sections which follow.
1 . 2 . 2 C o m p a r a b i l i t y  o f  R e p o r t i n g
In order to meet the objectives of the IPCC/OECD/IEA programme, inventories must be
readily comparable.  This requires a large measure of commonality of definitions of
activities (source/sink categories) and fuel product groups and the use of a reporting
discipline which makes evident the construction of the inventory from the activity data.
Specific guidelines for reporting have been prepared.  In order to reduce the uncertainty
created by possibly different definitions, the IPCC Reporting Instructions have largely
adopted definitions utilised by the IEA for the regular collection of energy data from
OECD member countries.  The active co-operation between the UN Statistical Division
(New York), the UN ECE (Geneva), Eurostat and the IEA has ensured that there are
now very few differences between the definitions employed by these organisations for the
collection of their energy data.  The IEA definitions may be found in the Glossary at the
end of the Reporting Instructions (Volume 1).
Although common standards for the collection of data by international organisations exist
the presentation of the data collected can be different.  At least five aspects of energy
data presentations need to be checked prior to using data for greenhouse gas inventories:
•
Are the energy data expressed in terms of net calorific values (NCV) or gross
calorific values (GCV)?2  Since most of the world uses net calorific values, the IPCC
Guidelines uses net calorific values.
•
Are non-commercial fuels, including wood and other biomass fuels, included?3
•
Are wood waste, agricultural wastes or waste-derived fuels included if combusted
for energy production?  These fuels should be accounted for in the IPCC
methodology, but are included  with biomass fuels.
                                                  
     2 The IEA generally reports data in net calorific values. The difference between the net and
the gross calorific value of a fuel is the heat of condensation of moisture in the fuel during
combustion. The net calorific value excludes this. The IEA assumes that net calorific values are
5 per cent lower than gross calorific values for oil and coal, and 10 per cent lower for natural
gas.
     3 While some of these fuels (such as wood) may be included in national or
international data sets, it is likely that they are underestimated due to poor record-
keeping and lack of statistical information for non-commercial fuels.

•
Is non-energy fuel usage (if non-oxidised) accounted for?4
•
How are international bunker fuels for air and ship transport treated?5
Given responses to these questions, several adjustments may need to be made to the
energy data being used in order to formulate a complete inventory of greenhouse gases.
If published IEA data are being used the following corrections must be made:
1
Consumption of vegetal fuels in non-OECD countries should be added to
commercial fuel consumption.  Estimates of the former are available in the IEA
publication cited.  Consumption of vegetal fuels, as declared by OECD countries in
their reports to the IEA, are included as “Combustible Renewables and Wastes” in
the IEA statistics for these countries.
2
International energy statistics show fuel consumption by industrial and commercial
electricity generators (autoproducers) as an identified part of fuel use by the energy
industries.  In order to harmonise inventory preparation with the EMEP/CORINAIR
methods, countries preparing IPCC inventories should include autoproducer fuel
consumption in the industry and commercial sectors and remove it from energy
industries.  See Recent Developments above.
3
Care is required when estimating the amount of fuel used without oxidation in the
manufacture of non-energy products.  IEA data generally cover only deliveries to the
industry sector manufacturing such products.  Some of the fuels delivered will be
oxidised by the user.   See Chapter 2, Industrial Processes, Overview.
4
IEA data do not include deliveries of oil for international air transport as part of the
International Bunkers data.  Where data are available they are identified as part of
the national transport sector fuel consumption.  UN estimates are available for
many countries.
1 . 2 . 3 U n c e r t a i n t y
The Reporting Instructions, Volume 1, make explicit provision for the reporting of
estimates from all source categories identified in the Standard Data Tables.  Energy
activity data and emission factors are both subject to wide variations through
uncertainties in basic data, identification of fuel qualities, calorific values and
measurements in emissions.  Furthermore, the uncertainties in estimates of fugitive
emissions can be larger than those from fuel combustion as wider ranges in natural
resource conditions and operations practice exist for fuel extraction and processing.  This
topic is discussed further in Section 1.8.7.  Managing and combining uncertainty estimates
from several sources is discussed in Appendix 1 to the Reporting Instructions.
                                                  
     4 This is normally reported in primary energy requirements but is not combusted and
therefore does not contribute directly to greenhouse gas emissions.
     5 International bunker fuels are combusted in ships at sea and by airplanes (both
undertaking international movements) and therefore should be included in global
greenhouse gas estimations.  Following guidance from the INC, the IPCC recommends
that every country estimate emissions from international bunker fuels sold within national
boundaries, but that these emissions would be reported separately and, as far as possible,
excluded from national totals.

Fuel Combustion: Overview
In the initial stages of the IPCC/OECD/IEA programme it was recognised that work on
both methods development and national inventories needed to be prioritised, as it was
not possible to deal with all of the gases and sources simultaneously.  Priority was given
to the direct GHGs in the order: carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide
(IPCC/OECD, 1991).  In Phase II of the Guidelines development, an attempt has been
made to identify default methods for a simplified Tier I method for estimating emissions
of the GHGs and SO2.
The purpose of a Tier 1 method is to assist countries that cannot access detailed fuel use
and technology data to develop emission inventories.  Consequently, the Tier 1 method
should enable at least rough emission estimations of CO2, CH4, N2O, NOx, CO and
NMVOC using energy statistics, and of SO2 by using additional assumptions on the
sulphur content of the fuels.
The Tier 1 method should be used in cases where no detailed information is available on
fuel type, technology and operating conditions.  If countries have more exact national
emission factors, these (and not the default factors) should be used.
Countries wanting to do more detailed emission estimations may use the Tier 2 method
described in Section 1.5.  A third option which may be used (Tier 3) is the CORINAIR 94
methodology which is described in the EEA TF Emission Inventory Guidebook and is
available on CD-ROM6.
1.4
Simple Methods (Tier 1) for Fuel
Combustion
The Tier 1 method for CO2 is fairly well established and is explained in Section 1.4.1.  For
non-CO2 gases, a simplified methodology has been developed to estimate emissions by
applying emission factors to fuel statistics which are organised by sector.  In reality, emissions of
these gases depend on the fuel type used, combustion technology, operating conditions, control
technology, and on maintenance and age of the equipment.  However, since it is unlikely that
many countries will have this detailed data, the Tier 1 method ignores these refinements (see
Box 1).
Section 1.4.2 provides average non-CO2 emission factors for the agreed IPCC source
categories together with additional information on the range of these factors and their
use.  The proposed values are based on emission factors included in Radian Corporation
(1990), US EPA (1995), the EDGAR database7, the CORINAIR 1990 database and
scientific reports from different countries.  SO2 emission factors are estimated using a
formula based on sulphur content in the fuel.  The compilation of default factors for
biomass fuels in the “Other Sectors” has been based on measurement data reported by
Smith and Ramakrishna (1990), Berdowski et al. (1993a and 1993b), Delmas (1993), Smith
et al. (1993), Delmas et al. (1995), Veldt and Berdowski (1995) and Brocard et al. (1996).

For aircraft, the emission factors for the Tier 1 method are based on the fleet average
values of NOx, CO and NMVOC of the global inventories compiled by NASA,

MAIN FUEL GROUPS
In the Tier 1 method for non-CO2 gases, the fuels are aggregated into the
following main groups:
• • coal
• • natural gas
• oil
gasoline for transport;
diesel oil for transport;
other oil products.
• biomass
wood / wood waste;
charcoal;
other biomass and wastes (includes dung, agricultural, municipal and
industrial wastes, bagasse and agricultural residues).
Note:  Refer to Section 1.2 of the Common Reporting Framework in the
Reporting Instructions for details on which products are included in each of
the main groups.
The default emission factors are internally consistent and it is essential to preserve this
consistency when replacing the default by local values so that total emissions of carbon
(for example) do not exceed the carbon available in the fuel.

In this section the methodology for estimating CO2 emissions from energy is discussed.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most common greenhouse gas produced by anthropogenic
activities, accounting for about 60 per cent of the increase in radiative forcing since pre-
industrial times (IPCC, 1992).  By far the largest source of CO2 emissions is from the
oxidation of carbon when fossil fuels are burned, which accounts for 70-90 per cent of
total anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  When fuels are burned, most carbon is emitted as
CO2 immediately during the combustion process.  Some carbon is released as CO, CH4,
or non-methane hydrocarbons, which oxidise to CO2 in the atmosphere within a period
from a few days to 10-11 years.  The IPCC methodology accounts for all of the carbon
from these emissions in the total for CO2 emissions.  The other carbon-containing gases
are also estimated and reported separately (see following sections for methodologies for
estimating CH4, CO, and NMVOCs).8
                                                  
     8 It is important to note that there is an intentional double counting of carbon emitted
from combustion. This format treats the non-CO2 gases as a subset of CO2 emissions
and ensures that the CO2 emission estimates reported by each country represent the
entire amount of carbon that would eventually be present in the atmosphere as CO2. The

Fuel combustion is widely dispersed throughout most activities in national economies
making assembly of a complete record of the quantities of each fuel type consumed in
each "end use" activity a considerable task which some countries have not yet completed.
Fortunately, it is possible to estimate national CO2 emissions by accounting for the
carbon in fuels supplied to the economy.  This is the basis of the IPCC Reference
Approach.  The supply of fuels is simple to record and is more likely to be available in
many countries than detailed end use consumption statistics.
The Reference Approach requires statistics for production of fuels and their external
trade as well as changes in their stocks.  It also needs a limited number of figures for the
consumption of fuels used for non-energy purposes where carbon may be stored.  It uses
a simple assumption: once carbon is brought into a national economy in fuel, it is either
saved in some way (e.g., in increases of fuel stocks, stored in products, left unoxidised in
ash) or it must be released to the atmosphere.  In order to calculate the carbon released
it is not necessary to know exactly how the fuel was used or what intermediate
transformations it underwent.  In this respect the methodology may be termed a “top-
down” approach compared with the “bottom-up” methods used for other gases.  As
stated in the Overview, this does not mean that a “bottom-up” approach should not be
followed for estimating CO2 emissions but the total emissions must be compared with
those obtained from the Reference Approach.  A “bottom-up” method for CO2 is briefly
discussed later in this section.
When estimating CO2 emissions from fuel combustion there are a number of points of a
statistical, technical or procedural nature which affect several of the estimation methods.
•
Fuel Carbon and Energy Content: There is considerable variation in the carbon
and energy content by weight of fuels.  However, expressing the carbon emission
factor as the carbon content per unit of energy released reduces this variation
because of the close link between the carbon content and energy value of the fuel.
It is natural therefore that all fuel supply and consumption data for combustion
emission calculations be expressed in energy units.  Energy data expressed in other
units should be converted to terajoules before use.
•
Unoxidised Carbon: When energy is consumed not all of the carbon in the fuel
oxidises to CO2.  Incomplete oxidation occurs due to inefficiencies in the
combustion process that leave some of the carbon unburned or partly oxidised as
soot or ash.
•
Stored Carbon:  Some of the fuel supplied to an economy is used as a raw
material (or feedstock) for manufacture of products such as plastics, fertiliser, or in
a non-energy use (e.g. bitumen for road construction, lubricants).  In some cases,
the carbon from the fuels is oxidised quickly to CO2.  In other cases the carbon is
stored (or sequestered) in the product, sometimes for as long as centuries.  The
amounts stored for long periods are called stored carbon and should be deducted
from the carbon emissions calculation.  Estimation of stored carbon requires data on
fuel used as feedstock and/or quantities of non-energy fuel products produced.  The
calculations are discussed within each of the alternative approaches presented in this
section.
•
Bunker Fuels: The IPCC methodology subtracts the quantities delivered to and
consumed by ships or aircraft for international transport from the fuel supply to the
country. In this manner, the CO2 emissions arising from the use of international bunkers
                                                                                                                                
reasons for this double counting are discussed in the Overview of the IPCC Guidelines,
General Notes on the Guidelines.

are not included in the national total.  To simplify the preparation of global estimates,
these emissions should be brought together in a separate table.
•
Biomass Fuels: Biomass fuels are included in the national energy and emissions
accounts for completeness.  These emissions should not be included in national CO2
emissions from fuel combustion.  If energy use, or any other factor, is causing a long
term decline in the total carbon embodied in standing biomass (e.g. forests), this net
release of carbon should be evident in the calculation of CO2 emissions described in
the Land Use Change and Forestry chapter.
All of the above issues are addressed within the methods presented in the remainder of
this section.
Approaches For Estimating CO2 Emissions
The estimation process can be divided into six steps that lead to figures for CO2
emissions from fuel combustion.
1
Estimate consumption of fuels by fuel/product type.
2
Convert  the fuel data to a common energy unit (TJ), if necessary.
3
Select carbon emission factors for each fuel/product type and estimate the total
carbon content of the fuels.
4
Estimate the amount of carbon stored in products for long periods of time.
5
Account for carbon not oxidised during combustion.
6
Convert emissions of carbon to full molecular weight of CO2 .

Estimate Fuel Consumption
The first step of the IPCC Reference Approach is to estimate apparent consumption of
fuels within the country.  This requires a balance of primary fuels produced, plus imports,
minus exports, minus international bunkers and minus net changes in stocks.  In this way
carbon is brought into the country from energy production and imports (adjusted for
stock changes) and moved out of the country through exports and international bunkers.
In order to avoid double counting it is important to distinguish between primary fuels,
which are fuels found in nature such as coal, crude oil and natural gas, and secondary fuels
or fuel products, such as gasoline and lubricants, which are derived from primary fuels.
To calculate the supply of fuels to the country, the following data are required for each
fuel and inventory year:
•
the amounts of primary fuels produced (production of secondary fuels and fuel
products is excluded);
•
the amounts of primary and secondary fuels and fuel products imported;
•
the amounts of primary and secondary fuels and fuel products exported;
•
the amounts of primary and secondary fuels used in international bunkers;
•
the net increases or decreases in stocks of fuels.

1.11
The apparent consumption of primary fuels is, therefore, calculated from the above data
as:
Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports - Exports
- International Bunkers - Stock Change.
An increase in stocks is a positive stock change which withdraws supply from
consumption.  A stock reduction is a negative stock change which, when subtracted in the
equation, causes an increase in apparent consumption.
Apparent consumption of secondary fuels should be added to primary apparent
consumption.  The production (or manufacture) of secondary fuels should be ignored in
the calculations because the carbon in these fuels will already have been included in the
supply of primary fuels from which they were derived; for instance, the estimate for
apparent consumption of crude oil already contains the carbon from which gasoline
would be refined.  Apparent consumption of secondary fuels is calculated as follows:
Apparent Consumption = Imports - Exports - International Bunkers
- Stock Change.
Note that this calculation can result in negative numbers for apparent consumption.  This
is a perfectly acceptable result for the purposes of this calculation since it indicates a net
export or stock increase in the country.
Since carbon content typically varies by fuel type, data should be reported for detailed
categories of fuel and product types as shown in Table 1-1.  The table also illustrates the
inputs and calculations recommended for the IPCC Reference Approach.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
calc = value to be calculated,    NA = not applicable
(a) Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports - Exports - International Bunkers - Stock Changes.  A stock
build is positive; a stock draw is negative.
(b) Apparent Consumption for the aggregate categories of Liquid Fossil, Solid Fossil, Gaseous Fossil, and Biomass
Fuels equal the sum of Apparent Consumption over the fuel types within the appropriate categories.
(c) If anthracite is not separately identifiable, include it with Other Bituminous Coal.
(d) If data are in 103t, separate conversion factors are available for Production, Imports and Exports in Table 1-2.
Each of these entries should be multiplied by the appropriate conversion factor.  Then, the results should be
summed to find Apparent Consumption in TJ (Column 8).
(e) Total should include Liquid, Solid, and Gaseous Fossil Fuel subtotals only.  Biomass subtotals are for reference
purposes only and should not be included in the totals.
(f) If value is in parenthesis it is a default value until a fuel-specific CEF is determined.
(g) Based on the assumption that 50 per cent of the carbon in the biomass is converted to methane.
(h) The bunker emissions are not to be added to national totals.
(i) See Column 4, “International Bunkers”.
_________________________________________________________________________
Convert Fuel Data to a Common Energy Unit (if necessary)
In the OECD/IEA Energy Statistics, and other energy data compilations, production and
consumption of solid and liquid fuels are specified in 103 tonnes.  To convert tonnes to
terajoules, net calorific values (NCV) must be applied.  The values to convert from 103 tonnes
to terajoules are in Table 1-2.  In some cases, particularly for coal, different NCVs are given for
production, imports and exports in a given country and are used to convert each category
separately when calculating apparent consumption.  For international bunkers and stock
changes national experts can use a weighted average of the different NCVs, or use the one for
the coal type which meets the largest share of total apparent consumption.  For refined
products the NCVs from 103 tonnes to terajoules do not normally vary greatly by country and
global default values are provided in Table 1-3.9
National experts may use more detailed locally available NCVs.  In this case, the values used
should also be reported and documented.  If original data are expressed in other energy units
such as British thermal units (Btu's) or million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe), they should be
converted to terajoules using standard conversion factors.  If energy data are already available
in terajoules on a net calorific value basis, no conversion is necessary and Column 7 of Table
1-1 can be ignored.
                                                  
     9 Throughout the Guidelines net calorific values are used and expressed in SI units or
multiples of SI units (for example TJ/kt).  The term Conversion Factor has two uses.  First,
as net calorific value, to convert quantities expressed in natural units to energy units, and
second as a scaling factor to convert one form of energy unit to another (e.g., Btu’s to
GJ).
