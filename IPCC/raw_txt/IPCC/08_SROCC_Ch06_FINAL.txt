Executive Summary
This chapter assesses extremes and abrupt or irreversible changes in 
the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate, to identify regional 
hot spots, cascading effects, their impacts on human and natural 
systems, and sustainable and resilient risk management strategies. 
It is not comprehensive in terms of the systems assessed and some 
information on extremes, abrupt and irreversible changes, in particular 
for the cryosphere, may be found in other chapters.
Ongoing and Emerging Changes in the Ocean 
and Cryosphere, and their Impacts on Ecosystems 
and Human Societies
Anthropogenic climate change has increased observed 
precipitation (medium conﬁdence), winds (low conﬁdence), 
and extreme sea level events (high conﬁdence) associated 
with some tropical cyclones, which has increased intensity of 
multiple extreme events and associated cascading impacts 
(high conﬁdence). Anthropogenic climate change may have 
contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone 
intensity in the western North Paciﬁc in recent decades related to 
anthropogenically-forced tropical expansion (low conﬁdence). 
There is emerging evidence for an increase in the annual global 
proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades 
(low conﬁdence). {6.3, Table 6.2, Figure 6.2, Box 6.1}
Changes in Arctic sea ice have the potential to inﬂuence 
mid-latitude weather (medium conﬁdence), but there is low 
conﬁdence in the detection of this inﬂuence for speciﬁc 
weather types. {6.3}
Extreme wave heights, which contribute to extreme sea level 
events, coastal erosion and ﬂooding, have increased in the 
Southern and North Atlantic Oceans by around 1.0 cm yr–1 and 
0.8 cm yr–1 over the period 1985–2018 (medium conﬁdence). 
Sea ice loss in the Arctic has also increased wave heights over 
the period 1992–2014 (medium conﬁdence). {6.3}
Marine heatwaves (MHWs), periods of extremely high ocean 
temperatures, have negatively impacted marine organisms 
and ecosystems in all ocean basins over the last two decades, 
including critical foundation species such as corals, seagrasses 
and kelps (very high conﬁdence). Globally, marine heat related 
events have increased; marine heatwaves, deﬁned when the daily sea 
surface temperature exceeds the local 99th percentile over the period 
1982 to 2016, have doubled in frequency and have become longer-
lasting, more intense and more extensive (very likely). It is very likely 
that between 84–90% of marine heatwaves that occurred between 
2006 and 2015 are attributable to the anthropogenic temperature 
increase. {6.4, Figures 6.3, 6.4}
Both palaeoclimate and modern observations suggest that the 
strongest El Niño and La Niña events since the pre-industrial  
period have occurred during the last ﬁfty years (medium 
conﬁdence). There have been three occurrences of extreme El 
Niño events during the modern observational period (1982–1983, 
1997–1998, 2015–2016), all characterised by pronounced rainfall 
in the normally dry equatorial East Paciﬁc. There have been two 
occurrences of extreme La Niña (1988–1989, 1998–1999). El 
Niño and La Niña variability during the last 50 years is unusually 
high compared with average variability during the last millennium. 
{6.5, Figure 6.5}
The equatorial Paciﬁc trade wind system experienced an 
unprecedented intensiﬁcation during 2001–2014, resulting in 
enhanced ocean heat transport from the Paciﬁc to the Indian 
Ocean, inﬂuencing the rate of global temperature change 
(medium conﬁdence). In the last two decades, total water transport 
from the Paciﬁc to the Indian Ocean by the Indonesian Throughﬂow (ITF), 
and the Indian Ocean to Atlantic Ocean has increased (high conﬁdence). 
Increased ITF has been linked to Paciﬁc cooling trends and basin-wide 
warming trends in the Indian Ocean. Paciﬁc sea surface temperature 
(SST) cooling trends and strengthened trade winds have been linked to 
an anomalously warm tropical Atlantic. {6.6, Figure 6.7}
Observations, both in situ (2004–2017) and based on sea 
surface temperature reconstructions, indicate that the Atlantic 
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has weakened 
relative to 1850–1900 (medium conﬁdence). There is insufﬁcient 
data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening, or to properly 
attribute it to anthropogenic forcing due to the limited length of the 
observational record. Although attribution is currently not possible, 
CMIP5 model simulations of the period 1850–2015, on average, 
exhibit a weakening AMOC when driven by anthropogenic forcing. 
{6.7, Figure 6.8}
Climate change is modifying multiple types of climate-related 
events or hazards in terms of occurrence, intensity and 
periodicity. It increases the likelihood of compound hazards 
that comprise simultaneously or sequentially occurring events 
to cause extreme impacts in natural and human systems. 
Compound events in turn trigger cascading impacts (high 
conﬁdence). Three case studies are presented in the chapter, 
(i) Tasmania’s Summer of 2015–2016, (ii) The Coral Triangle and 
(ii) Hurricanes of 2017. {6.8, Box 6.1}

Projections of Ocean and Cryosphere Change  
and Hazards to Ecosystems and Human Society  
Under Low and High Emission Futures
The average intensity of tropical cyclones, the proportion 
of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones and the associated 
average precipitation rates are projected to increase for a 2ºC 
global temperature rise above any baseline period (medium 
conﬁdence). Rising mean sea levels will contribute to higher 
extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones (very high 
conﬁdence). Coastal hazards will be exacerbated by an increase in 
the average intensity, magnitude of storm surge and precipitation 
rates of tropical cyclones. There are greater increases projected 
under RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6 from around mid-century to 2100 
(medium conﬁdence). There is low conﬁdence in changes in the 
future frequency of tropical cyclones at the global scale. {6.3.1}
Signiﬁcant wave heights (the average height from trough to 
crest of the highest one-third of waves) are projected to increase 
across the Southern Ocean and tropical eastern Paciﬁc (high 
conﬁdence) and Baltic Sea (medium conﬁdence) and decrease 
over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea under RCP8.5 
(high conﬁdence). Coastal tidal amplitudes and patterns are projected 
to change due to sea level rise and coastal adaptation measures (very 
likely). Projected changes in waves arising from changes in weather 
patterns, and changes in tides due to sea level rise, can locally enhance 
or ameliorate coastal hazards (medium conﬁdence). {6.3.1, 5.2.2}
Marine heatwaves are projected to further increase in 
frequency, duration, spatial extent and intensity (maximum 
temperature) (very high conﬁdence). Climate models project 
increases in the frequency of marine heatwaves by 2081–2100, 
relative to 1850–1900, by approximately 50 times under RCP8.5 and 
20 times under RCP2.6 (medium conﬁdence). The largest increases 
in frequency are projected for the Arctic and the tropical oceans 
(medium conﬁdence). The intensity of marine heatwaves is projected 
to increase about 10-fold under RCP8.5 by 2081–2100, relative to 
1850–1900 (medium conﬁdence). {6.4}
Extreme El Niño and La Niña events are projected to likely 
increase in frequency in the 21st century and to likely intensify 
existing hazards, with drier or wetter responses in several 
regions across the globe. Extreme El Niño events are projected to 
occur about as twice as often under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in the 
21st century when compared to the 20th century (medium conﬁdence). 
Projections indicate that extreme Indian Ocean Dipole events also 
increase in frequency (low conﬁdence). {6.5; Figures 6.5, 6.6}
Lack of long-term sustained Indian and Paciﬁc Ocean 
observations, and inadequacies in the ability of climate models 
to simulate the magnitude of trade wind decadal variability 
and the inter-ocean link, mean there is low conﬁdence in 
future projections of the trade wind system. {6.6, Figure 6.7}
The AMOC will very likely weaken over the 21st century (high 
conﬁdence), although a collapse is very unlikely (medium 
conﬁdence). Nevertheless, a substantial weakening of the 
AMOC remains a physically plausible scenario. Such a weakening 
would strongly impact natural and human systems, leading to 
a decrease in marine productivity in the North Atlantic, more winter 
storms in Europe, a reduction in Sahelian and South Asian summer 
rainfall, a decrease in the number of TCs in the Atlantic, and an increase 
in regional sea level around the Atlantic especially along the northeast 
coast of North America (medium conﬁdence). Such impacts would be 
superimposed on the global warming signal. {6.7, Figure 6.8}
Impacts from further changes in TCs and ETCs, MHWs, extreme 
El Niño and La Niña events and other extremes will exceed 
the limits of resilience and adaptation of ecosystems and 
people, leading to unavoidable loss and damage (medium 
conﬁdence). {6.9.2}
Strengthening the Global Responses in the Context 
of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Charting 
Climate Resilient Development Pathways for Oceans 
and Cryosphere
There is medium conﬁdence that including extremes and 
abrupt changes, such as AMOC weakening, ice sheet collapse 
(West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Greenland Ice Sheet 
(GIS)), leads to a several-fold increase in the cost of carbon 
emissions (medium conﬁdence). If carbon emissions decline, 
the risk of extremes and abrupt changes are reduced, creating 
co-beneﬁts. {6.8.6}
For TCs and ETCs, investment in disaster risk reduction, ﬂood 
management (ecosystem and engineered) and early warning 
systems decreases economic loss (medium conﬁdence), but 
such investments may be hindered by limited local capacities, 
such as increased losses and mortality from extreme winds and 
storm surges in less developed countries despite adaptation 
efforts. There is emerging evidence of increasing risks for locations 
impacted by unprecedented storm trajectories (low conﬁdence). 
Managing the risk from such changing storm trajectories and intensity 
proves challenging because of the difﬁculties of early warning and its 
receptivity by the affected population (high conﬁdence). {6.3, 6.9}
Limiting global warming would reduce the risk of impacts of 
MHWs, but critical thresholds for some ecosystems (e.g., kelp 
forests, coral reefs) will be reached at relatively low levels of 
future global warming (high conﬁdence). Early warning systems, 
producing skillful forecasts of MHWs, can further help to reduce the 
vulnerability in the areas of ﬁsheries, tourism and conservation, but 
are yet unproven at large scale (medium conﬁdence). {6.4}

Sustained long-term monitoring and improved forecasts 
can be used in managing the risks of extreme El Niño and 
La Niña events associated with human health, agriculture, 
ﬁsheries, coral reefs, aquaculture, wildﬁre, drought and ﬂood 
management (high conﬁdence). {6.5}
Extreme change in the trade wind system and its impacts 
on global variability, biogeochemistry, ecosystems and 
society have not been adequately understood and represent 
signiﬁcant knowledge gaps. {6.6}
By 2300, an AMOC collapse is as likely as not for high emission 
pathways and very unlikely for lower ones, highlighting that 
an AMOC collapse can be avoided in the long term by CO2 
mitigation (medium conﬁdence). Nevertheless, the human impact 
of these physical changes have not been sufﬁciently quantiﬁed and 
there are considerable knowledge gaps in adaptation responses to 
a substantial AMOC weakening. {6.7}
The ratio between risk reduction investment and reduction of 
damages of extreme events varies. Investing in preparation 
and prevention against the impacts from extreme events is 
very likely less than the cost of impacts and recovery (medium 
conﬁdence). Coupling insurance mechanisms with risk reduction 
measures can enhance the cost-effectiveness of adapting to climate 
change (medium conﬁdence). {6.9}
Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction require 
capacity building and an integrated approach to ensure 
trade-offs between short- and long-term gains in dealing 
with the uncertainty of increasing extreme events, abrupt 
changes and cascading impacts at different geographic scales 
(high conﬁdence). {6.9}
Limiting the risk from the impact of extreme events and abrupt 
changes leads to successful adaptation to climate change 
with the presence of well-coordinated climate-affected 
sectors and disaster management relevant agencies (high 
conﬁdence). Transformative governance inclusive of successful 
integration of disaster risk management (DRM) and climate 
change adaptation, empowerment of vulnerable groups, and 
accountability of governmental decisions promotes climate-
resilient development pathways (high conﬁdence). {6.9}

Introduction
This chapter assesses extremes and abrupt or irreversible changes in 
the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate, to identify regional 
hot spots, cascading effects, their impacts on human and natural 
systems, and sustainable and resilient risk management strategies. 
While not comprehensive in terms of discussing all such phenomena, 
it addresses a number of issues that are prominent in both the 
policy area and in the scientiﬁc literature. Further information may 
also be found in Chapters 2 to 4 for other aspects of the ocean 
and cryosphere.
Building on the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme 
Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX; 
IPCC, 2012), IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5; IPCC, 2013; IPCC, 
2014) assessments and the Special Report on Global Warming 
of 1.5ºC (SR15; IPCC, 2018), for each of the topics addressed, we 
provide an assessment of:
• Key processes and feedbacks, observations, 
detection and attribution, projections;
• Impacts on human and natural systems;
• Monitoring and early warning systems;
• Risk management and adaptation, sustainable 
and resilient pathways.
The chapter is organised in terms of the space- and time-scales of 
different phenomena. We move from small-scale TCs, which last for 
days to weeks, to the global-scale AMOC, which has time scales of 
decades to centuries. A common risk framework is adopted, based 
on that used in AR5 and introduced in Chapter 1, Section 1.5 and 
Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1 (Figure 6.1).
While much of what is discussed within the chapter concerns 
the ocean, we also summarise abrupt events in the cryosphere in 
Section 6.2, drawing information from Chapters 2 to 4, where the 
main assessment of those phenomena may be found.
6.1.1 
Deﬁnitions of Principal Terms
In discussing concepts such as abrupt changes, irreversibility, tipping 
points and extreme events it is important to deﬁne precisely what is 
meant by those terms. The following deﬁnitions are therefore adopted 
(based on either AR5, Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC (SR15) 
or Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) Glossaries):
Abrupt climate change: A large-scale change in the climate system 
that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated 
to persist) for at least a few decades, and causes substantial 
disruptions in human and natural systems.

Figure 6.1 |  Framework used in this chapter (see discussion in Chapter 1). Singular or multiple climate drivers can lead to extreme hazards and associated cascading 
impacts, which combined with non-climatic drivers affect exposure and vulnerability, leading to compound risks. Extremes discussed are tropical cyclones (TCs) and 
extratropical cyclones (ETCs) and associated sea surface dynamics (Section 6.3); marine heatwaves (MHWs) (Section 6.4), extreme El Niño and La Niña events (Section 6.5); 
and extreme oceanic decadal variability (Section 6.6). Examples of abrupt events, irreversibility and tipping points discussed are the Atlantic Meridional Overturning 
Circulation (AMOC) and subpolar gyre (SPG) system (Section 6.7). Section 6.2 also collects examples of such events from the rest of the Special Report on the Oceans and 
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) and compiles examples of events whose occurrence or severity has been linked to climate change. Cascading impacts and 
compound events are discussed in Section 6.8 and three examples are given in Box 6.1. Section 6.9 discusses risk management, climate resilience pathways, transformative 
governance adaptation and mitigation required to address societal and environmental risks.

Chapter 6

Extreme weather/climate event: An extreme event is an event 
that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Deﬁnitions of ‘rare’ 
vary, but an extreme event would normally be as rare as or rarer 
than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function 
estimated from observations. By deﬁnition, the characteristics of 
what is called an extreme event may vary from place to place in 
an absolute sense. When a pattern of extreme weather persists for 
some time, such as a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate 
event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme 
(e.g., high temperature, drought, or total rainfall over a season).
Irreversibility: A perturbed state of a dynamical system is deﬁned 
as irreversible on a given timescale, if the recovery timescale from 
this state due to natural processes is signiﬁcantly longer than the 
time it takes for the system to reach this perturbed state. In the 
context of this report, the recovery time scale of interest is hundreds 
to thousands of years.
Tipping point: A level of change in system properties beyond which 
a system reorganises, often in a nonlinear manner, and does not 
return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated. 
For the climate system, the term refers to a critical threshold when 
global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another 
stable state. Tipping points are also used when referring to impact; 
the term can imply that an impact tipping point is (about to be) 
reached in a natural or human system.
These above four terms generally refer to aspects of the physical 
climate system. Here we extend their deﬁnitions to natural and 
human systems. For example, there may be gradual physical climate 
change which causes an irreversible change in an ecosystem. 
An adaptation tipping point could be reached when an adaptation 
option no longer remains effective. There may be a tipping point 
within a governance structure.
We also introduce two new key terms relevant for discussing 
risk-related concepts:
Compound events refer to the combination of multiple drivers 
and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risks.
Cascading impacts from extreme weather/climate events occur 
when an extreme hazard generates a sequence of secondary events 
in natural and human systems that result in physical, natural, social 
or economic disruption, whereby the resulting impact is signiﬁcantly 
larger than the initial impact. Cascading impacts are complex and 
multi-dimensional, and are associated more with the magnitude of 
vulnerability than with that of the hazard.

Some potentially abrupt or irreversible events are assessed in other 
chapters, hence Table 6.1 presents a cross-chapter summary of 
those. Subsection numbers indicate where detailed information may

likelihood of an abrupt/irreversible change based on the assessed literature which, in general, assesses Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Assessments 
of likelihood and conﬁdence are made according to IPCC guidance on uncertainties.

Recent Anomalous Extreme Climate 
Events and their Causes
The attribution of changes in the observed statistics of extremes are 
generally addressed using well-established detection-attribution 
methods. In contrast, record-breaking weather and climate 
events are by deﬁnition unique, and can be expected to occur 
with or without climate change as the observed record lengthens. 
Therefore, event attribution begins with the premise that the 
climate is changing, the goal being to determine statistically how 
much climate change has contributed to the severity of the event 
(Trenberth et al. 2015; Shepherd, 2016). Annual reports dedicated to 
extreme event attribution (Peterson et al. 2012; Peterson et al. 2013; 
Herring et al. 2014; Herring et al. 2015; Herring et al. 2018) have helped 
stimulate studies that adopt recognised methods for extreme event 
attribution. The increasing pool of studies allows different approaches 
to be contrasted and builds consensus on the role of climate change 
when individual climate events are studied by multiple teams using 
different methods. A number of these events are summarised in 
Table 6.2 and Figure 6.2. Collectively, these studies show that the 
role of climate change in the ocean and cryosphere extreme events 
is increasingly driving extreme climate and weather events across 
the globe including compound events (high conﬁdence). Some 
regions including Africa and the Paciﬁc have had relatively fewer 
event attribution studies undertaken, possibly reﬂecting the lack of 
capacity by regional and national technical institutions. A caveat of 
this approach is that there is a potential for ‘null results’, that is, 
cases where attribution is not possible, to be reported. Nevertheless, 
there is no evidence that this is the case, and the number of recent 
studies and wide range of phenomena addressed suggests increasing 
inﬂuence of climate change on extreme events.

Table 6.2 |  A selection of extreme events with links to oceans and cryosphere. In many of these studies the method of event attribution has been used to estimate the 
role of climate change using either a probabilistic approach (using ensembles of climate models to assess how much more likely the event has become with anthropogenic 
climate change compared to a world without) or a storyline approach which examines the components of the climate system that contribute to the events and how changes 
in the climate system affect them (Shepherd, 2016).

Rudnick et al. 2017) and subsurface 
warm anomalies in the deep British 
Columbia Fjord that persisted 
through the beginning of 2018 
(Jackson and Wood, 2018)
Emerged in 2013 in response to teleconnections 
between North Paciﬁc and the weak El Niño 
that drove strong positive sea level pressure 
anomalies across the northeast Paciﬁc inducing 
smaller heat loss (Bond et al. 2015; Di Lorenzo 
and Mantua, 2016). Global warming increased 
the probability of occurrence for regional parts 
of the MHW (Weller et al. 2015; Jacox et al.

This section addresses new literature on TCs and ETCs and their 
effects on the ocean in the context of understanding how the 
changing nature of extreme events can cause compound hazards, 
risk and cascading impacts (discussed in Section 6.8). These topics 
are also discussed in Chapter 4 in the context of changes to ESLs 
(see Section 4.2.3.4).

IPCC AR5 concluded that there was low conﬁdence in any long-
term increases in TC activity globally and in attribution of global 
changes to any particular cause (Bindoff et  al. 2013; Hartmann 
et  al. 2013). Based on process understanding and agreement in 
21st century projections, it is likely that the global TC frequency will 
either decrease or remain essentially unchanged, while global mean

TC maximum wind speed and precipitation rates will likely increase 
although there is low conﬁdence in region-speciﬁc projections of 
frequency and intensity (Christensen et al. 2013). The AR5 concluded 
that circulation features have moved poleward since the 1970s, 
associated with a widening of the tropical belt, a poleward shift of 
storm tracks and jet streams, and contractions of the northern polar 
vortex and the Southern Ocean westerly wind belts. However it is 
noted that natural modes of variability on interannual to decadal 
time scales prevent the detection of a clear climate change signal 
(Hartmann et al. 2013). 
Since the AR5 and Knutson et  al. (2010), palaeoclimatic surveys 
of coastal overwash sediments and stalagmites have provided 
further evidence of historical TC variability over the past several 
millennia. Patterns of storm activity across TC basins show variations 
through time that appear to be correlated with El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and changes in 
atmospheric dynamics related to changes in precession of the sun 
(Toomey et al. 2013; Denommee et al. 2014; Denniston et al. 2015). 
Further studies have investigated the dynamics of TCs. A modelling 
study investigated a series of low-frequency increases and decreases 
in TC activity over the North Atlantic over the 20th century 
(Dunstone  et  al. 2013). These variations, culminating in a recent 
rise in activity, are thought to be due in part to atmospheric aerosol 
forcing variations (aerosol forcing), which exerts a cooling effect 
(Booth  et  al. 2012; Dunstone et  al. 2013). However, the relative 
importance of internal variability vs. radiative forcing for multidecadal 
variability in the Atlantic basin, including TC variability, remains 
uncertain (Weinkle et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Vecchi et al. 2017; 
Yan et  al., 2017). Although the aerosol cooling effect has largely 
cancelled the increases in potential intensity over the observational 
period, according to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 
(CMIP5) model historical runs, further anthropogenic warming in the 
future is expected to dominate the aerosol cooling effect leading to 
increasing TC intensities (Sobel et al. 2016).
TCs amplify wave heights along the tracks of rapidly moving cyclones 
(e.g., Moon et  al. 2015a) and can therefore increase mixing to the 
surface of cooler subsurface water. Several studies found that TCs 
reduce the projected thermal stratiﬁcation of the upper ocean in 
CMIP5 models under global warming, thereby slightly offsetting the 
simulated TC-intensity increases under climate warming conditions 
(Emanuel, 2015; Huang et al. 2015b; Tuleya et al. 2016). On the other 
hand, freshening of the upper ocean by TC rainfall enhances density 
stratiﬁcation by reducing near-surface salinity and this reduces the 
ability of TC’s to cool the upper ocean, thereby having an inﬂuence 
opposite to the thermal stratiﬁcation effect (Balaguru et al. 2015). In 
the late 21st century, increased salinity stratiﬁcation was found to offset 
about 50% of the suppressive effects that TC mixing has on temperature 
stratiﬁcation (Balaguru et al. 2015). Coupled ocean-atmosphere models 
still robustly project an increase of TC intensity with climate warming, and 
particularly for new TC-permitting coupled climate model simulations 
that compute internally consistent estimates of thermal stratiﬁcation 
change (e.g., Kim et al. 2014a; Bhatia et al. 2018). Higher TC intensities 
in turn may further aggravate the impacts of SLR on TC-related coastal 
inundation extremes (Timmermans et al. 2017). 
Kossin et al. (2014) identiﬁed a poleward expansion of the latitudes 
of maximum TC intensity in recent decades, which has been linked to 
an anthropogenically-forced tropical expansion (Sharmila and Walsh, 
2018) and a continued poleward shift of cyclones projected over the 
western North Paciﬁc in a warmer climate (Kossin et al. 2016). A 10% 
slowdown in translation speed of TCs over the 1949–2016 period has 
been linked to the weakening of the tropical summertime circulation 
associated with tropical expansion and a more pronounced slowdown 
in the range 16–22% was found over land areas affected by TCs in the 
western North Paciﬁc, North Atlantic and Australian regions (Kossin, 
2018). Slow-moving TCs together with higher moisture carrying 
capacity can cause signiﬁcantly greater ﬂood hazards (Emanuel, 
2017; Risser and Wehner, 2017; van Oldenborgh et al. 2017; see also 
Table 6.2 and Box 6.1).
Trends in TCs over decades to a century or more have been 
investigated in several new studies. Key ﬁndings include: i) decreasing 
frequency of severe TCs that make landfall in eastern Australia 
since the late 1800s (Callaghan and Power, 2011); ii) increase in 
frequency of moderately large US storm surge events since 1923 
(Grinsted et al. 2012); iii) recent increase of extremely severe cyclonic 
storms over the Arabian Sea in the post-monsoon season (Murakami 
et al. 2017); iv) intense TCs that make landfall in East and Southeast 
Asia in recent decades (Mei and Xie, 2016; Li et al. 2017); and v) an 
increase in annual global proportion of hurricanes reaching Category 
4 or 5 intensity in recent decades (Holland and Bruyère, 2014).
Rapid intensiﬁcation of tropical cyclones (RITCs) poses forecast 
challenges 
and 
increased 
risks 
for 
coastal 
communities 
(Emanuel,  2017). Warming of the upper ocean in the central and 
eastern tropical Atlantic associated with the positive phase of the 
Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) (Balaguru et al. 2018) and 
in the western North Paciﬁc in recent decades due to a La Niña-like 
pattern (Zhao et al. 2018) has favoured RITCs in these regions. One 
new modelling study suggests there has been a detectable increase 
in RITC occurrence in the Atlantic basin in recent decades, with 
a positive contribution from anthropogenic forcing (Bhatia et al. 2019). 
Nonetheless, the background conditions that favour RITC’s across the 
Atlantic basin as a whole tend to be associated with less favourable 
conditions for TC occurrence along the US east coast (Kossin, 2017). 
New studies have used event attribution to explore attribution of certain 
individual TC events or anomalous seasonal cyclone activity events 
to anthropogenic forcing (Lackmann, 2015; Murakami  et  al.  2015; 
Takayabu et  al. 2015; Zhang et  al. 2016; Emanuel, 2017; see also 
Table 6.2 and Box 6.1). Risser and Wehner (2017) and van Oldenborgh 
et al. (2017) concluded that for the Hurricane Harvey event, there is 
a detectable human inﬂuence on extreme precipitation in the Houston 
area, although their detection analysis is for extreme precipitation in 
general and not speciﬁcally for TC-related precipitation. 
There have been more TC dynamical or statistical/dynamical 
downscaling studies and higher resolution General Circulation Model 
(GCM) experiments (e.g., Emanuel, 2013; Manganello  et  al.  2014; 
Knutson et  al. 2015; Murakami et  al. 2015; Roberts et  al. 2015; 
Wehner  et  al. 2015; Yamada et  al. 2017). The ﬁndings of these 
studies generally support the AR5 projections of a general increase 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks 
Chapter 6

603
in intensity of the most intense TCs and a decline in TC frequency 
overall. However, the projected increase in global TC frequency by 
Emanuel (2013) and Bhatia et al. (2018) differed from most other 
TC frequency projections and previous assessments. For studies 
into future track changes of TCs under climate warming scenarios 
(Li et al. 2010; Kim and Cai, 2014; Manganello et al. 2014; Knutson 
et al. 2015; Murakami et al. 2015; Roberts et al. 2015; Wehner et al. 
2015; Nakamura et al. 2017; Park et al. 2017; Sugi et al. 2017; Yamada 
et al. 2017; Yoshida et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017a), it is difﬁcult to 
identify a robust consensus of projected change in TC tracks, although 
several of the studies found either poleward or eastward expansion 
of TC occurrence over the North Paciﬁc region resulting in greater 
storm occurrence in the central North Paciﬁc. There have been new 
studies on storm size (Kim et al. 2014a; Knutson et al. 2015; Yamada 
et al. 2017) under climate warming scenarios. These project TC size 
changes of up to ±10% between basins and studies and provide 
preliminary ﬁndings on this issue that future studies will continue 
to investigate. Several studies of TC storm surge (e.g., Lin et al. 2012; 
Garner et  al. 2017) suggest that SLR will dominate the increased 
height of storm surge due to TCs under climate change. 
Taking the above into account, the following is a summary assessment 
of TC detection and attribution. The observed poleward migration 
of the latitude of maximum TC intensity in the western North 
Paciﬁc appears to be unusual compared to expected natural 
variability and therefore there is low to medium conﬁdence that 
this change represents a detectable climate change, though with 
only low conﬁdence that the observed shift has a discernible 
positive contribution from anthropogenic forcing. Anthropogenic 
forcing is believed to be producing some poleward expansion of 
the tropical circulation with climate warming. Additional studies 
of observed long-term TC changes such as: an increase in annual 
global proportion of Category 4 or 5 TCs in recent decades, severe 
TCs occurring in the Arabian Sea, TCs making landfall in East and 
Southeast Asia, the increasing frequency of moderately large US 
storm surge events since 1923 and the decreasing frequency of 
severe TCs that make landfall in eastern Australia since the late 
1800s, may each represent emerging anthropogenic signals, but still 
with low conﬁdence (limited evidence). The lack of conﬁdent climate 
change detection for most TC metrics continues to limit conﬁdence 
in both future projections and in the attribution of past changes and 
TC events, since TC event attribution in most published studies is 
generally being inferred without support from a conﬁdent climate 
change detection of a long-term trend in TC activity. 
TCs projections for the late 21st century are summarised as follows: 
1) there is medium conﬁdence that the proportion of TCs that reach 
Category 4–5 levels will increase, that the average intensity of TCs 
will increase (by roughly 1–10%, assuming a 2ºC global temperature 
rise), and that average TCs precipitation rates (for a given storm) will 
increase by at least 7% per degree Celsius SST warming, owing to 
higher atmospheric water vapour content, 2) there is low conﬁdence 
(low agreement, medium evidence) in how global TC frequency will 
change, although most modelling studies project some decrease in 
global TC frequency and 3) SLR will lead to higher storm surge levels 
for the TCs that do occur, assuming all other factors are unchanged 
(very high conﬁdence).
6.3.1.2 
Extratropical Cyclones and Blocking
ETCs form in the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic, North Paciﬁc 
and Southern Oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea. The storm 
track regions are characterised by large surface equator-to-pole 
temperature gradients and baroclinic instability, and jet streams 
inﬂuence the direction and speed of movement of ETCs in this region. 
The thermodynamic response of the atmosphere to CO2 tends to 
have opposing inﬂuences on storm tracks; surface shortwave cloud 
radiative changes increase the equator-to-pole temperature gradient 
whereas longwave cloud radiative changes reduce it (Shaw et  al. 
2016). AR5 concluded that the global number of ETCs is not expected 
to decrease by more than a few percent due to anthropogenic 
change. The Southern Hemisphere (SH) storm track is projected to 
have a small poleward shift, but the magnitude is model dependent 
(Christensen et al. 2013). AR5 also found a low conﬁdence in the 
magnitude of regional storm track changes and the impact of such 
changes on regional surface climate (Christensen et al. 2013).
A ‘blocking’ event is an extratropical weather system in which the 
anticyclone (region of high pressure) becomes quasi-stationary 
and interrupts the usual westerly ﬂow and/or storm tracks for up 
to a  week or more (Woollings et  al. 2018). Recent attention has 
focused on whether Arctic warming is linked to increased blocking 
and mid-latitude weather extremes (Barnes and Screen, 2015; Francis 
and Skiﬁc, 2015; Francis and Vavrus, 2015; Kretschmer et al. 2016), 
such as drought in California due to sea ice changes that cause 
a reorganisation of tropical convection (Cvijanovic et al. 2017), cold 
and snowy winters over Europe and North America (Liu et al. 2012; 
Cohen et  al. 2018), extreme summer weather (Tang  et  al. 2013; 
Coumou et  al. 2014) and Balkan ﬂooding (Stadtherr et  al. 2016). 
Studies suggest how blocking may inﬂuence arctic sea ice extent 
(Gong and Luo, 2017) and various pathways whereby Arctic warming 
could inﬂuence extreme weather (Barnes and Screen, 2015) such as 
reducing the equator to pole temperature gradient, slowing the jet 
stream thereby increasing its meandering behaviour (Röthlisberger 
et al. 2016; Mann et al. 2017) or causing it to split (Coumou et al. 
2014), changing local dynamics in the vicinity of the sea ice edge 
(Screen and Simmonds, 2013) or weakening the stratospheric 
polar vortex (Cohen et al. 2014). However, sensitivity to choice of 
methodology (Screen and Simmonds, 2013) and large internal 
atmospheric variability masks the detection of such links in past 
records, and climate change can lead to opposing effects on the mid-
latitude jet stream response leading to large uncertainty in future 
changes (Barnes and Polvani, 2015; Barnes and Screen, 2015).
New studies of future storm track behaviour in the NH, include 
Harvey et al. (2014) who ﬁnd that the future changes to upper and 
lower tropospheric equator-to-pole temperature differences by the 
end of the century in a CMIP5 multi-model RCP8.5 ensemble are 
not well correlated and the lower temperature gradient dominates 
the summer storm track response whereas both upper and lower 
temperature gradients play a role in winter. In the northern North 
Atlantic storm track region, projected changes are found to be 
more strongly associated with changes in the lower rather than 
upper tropospheric equator-to-pole temperature difference (Harvey 
et  al. 2015). In the SH, Harvey et  al. (2014) ﬁnd equator-to-pole 
Chapter 6 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks

604
temperature differences in the upper and lower troposphere in the 
future climate across a multi-model ensemble are well correlated 
with a general strengthening of the storm track. The total number 
of ETCs in a CMIP5 GCM multi-model ensemble decreased in the 
future climate, whereas the number of strong ETCs increased in most 
models and in the ensemble mean (Grieger et al. 2014). This was 
associated with a general poleward shift related to both tropical 
upper tropospheric warming and shifting meridional SST gradients in 
the Southern Ocean. The poleward movement of baroclinic instability 
and associated storm formation over the observational period due to 
external radiative forcing, is projected to continue, with associated 
declining rainfall trends in the mid-latitudes and positive trends 
further polewards (Frederiksen et al. 2017).
A number of new studies have found links between Arctic ampliﬁcation, 
blocking events and various types of weather extremes in NH mid-
latitudes in recent decades. However, the sensitivity of results to 
analysis technique and the generally short record with respect to 
internal variability means that at this stage there is low conﬁdence 
in these connections. Consistent with the AR5, projected changes to 
NH storm tracks exhibit large differences between responses, causal 
mechanisms and ocean basins and so there remains low conﬁdence 
in future changes in blocking and storm tracks in the NH. The storm 
track projections for the SH remain consistent with previous studies 
in indicating an observed poleward contraction and a continued 
strengthening and southward contraction of storm tracks in the 
future (medium conﬁdence).
6.3.1.3 
Waves and Extreme Sea Levels
AR5 also concluded that there is medium conﬁdence that mean 
signiﬁcant wave height has increased in the North Atlantic north of 
45ºN based on ship observations and reanalysis-forced wave model 
hindcasts. ESL events have increased since 1970, mainly due to a rise 
in mean sea levels (MSLs) over this period (Rhein et al. 2013). There 
is medium conﬁdence that mid-latitude jets will move 1–2 degrees 
further poleward by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 in both 
hemispheres with weaker shifts in the NH. In the SH during austral 
summer, the poleward movement of the mid-latitude westerlies under 
climate change is projected to be partially offset by stratospheric 
ozone recovery. There is low conﬁdence in projections of NH storm 
tracks particularly in the North Atlantic. Tropical expansion is likely 
to continue causing wider tropical regions and poleward movement 
of the subtropical dry zones (Collins et al. 2013). In the SH, it is likely 
that enhanced wind speeds will cause an increase in annual mean 
signiﬁcant wave heights. Wave swells generated in the Southern 
Ocean may also affect wave heights, periods and directions in 
adjacent ocean basins. The projected reduction in sea ice extent in 
the Arctic Ocean (Holland et al. 2006) will increase wave heights and 
wave season length (Church et al. 2013).
Since AR5, new studies have shown observed changes in wave climate. 
Satellite observations from 1985–2018, showed small increases 
in signiﬁcant wave height (+0.3 cm/year) and larger increases in 
extreme wave heights (90th percentiles), especially in the Southern 
(+1 cm/year) and North Atlantic (+0.8 cm/year) Oceans (Young and 
Ribal, 2019) as well as positive trends in wave height in the Arctic 
over 1992–2014 due to sea ice loss (Stopa et al. 2016; Thomson et al. 
2016). Based on a wave reanalysis and satellite observations, Reguero 
et al. (2019) found that the global wave power, which represents the 
transport of the energy transferred from the wind into the sea surface 
motion, therefore including wave height, period and direction, has 
increased globally at a rate of 0.41% yr–1 between 1948 and 2008, 
with large variations across oceans. Long-term correlations are found 
between the increase in wave power and SSTs, particularly between 
the tropical Atlantic temperatures and the wave power in high 
southern latitudes, the most energetic region globally.
The results of several new global wave climate projection studies 
are consistent with those presented in IPCC AR5. Mentaschi et al. 
(2017) ﬁnd up to a 30% increase in 100-year return level wave 
energy ﬂux (the rate of transfer of wave energy) for the majority 
of coastal areas in the southern temperate zone, and a projected 
decrease in wave energy ﬂux for most NH coastal areas at the end of 
the century in wave model simulations forced by six CMIP5 RCP8.5 
simulations. The most signiﬁcant long-term trends in extreme wave 
energy ﬂux are explained by their relationship to modelled climate 
indices (Arctic Oscillation, ENSO and NAO). Wang et  al. (2014b) 
assessed the climate change signal and uncertainty in a 20-member 
ensemble of wave height simulations, and found model uncertainty 
(inter-model variability) is signiﬁcant globally, being about 10 times 
as large as the variability between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. 
In a study focussing on the western north Paciﬁc wave climate, 
Shimura et al. (2015) associate projected regions of future change 
in wave climate with spatial variation of SSTs in the tropical Paciﬁc 
Ocean. A review of 91 published global and regional scale wind-wave 
climate projection studies found a consensus on a projected increase 
in signiﬁcant wave height over the Southern Ocean, tropical eastern 
Paciﬁc (high conﬁdence) and Baltic Sea (medium conﬁdence), and 
decrease over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. They found 
little agreement between studies of projected changes over the 
Atlantic Ocean, southern Indian and eastern North Paciﬁc Ocean and 
no regional agreement of projected changes to extreme wave height. 
It was noted that few studies focussed on wave direction change, 
which is important for shoreline response (Morim et al. 2018).
Signiﬁcant developments have taken place since the AR5 to model 
storm surges and tides at the global scale. An unstructured global 
hydrodynamic modelling system has been developed with maximum 
coastal resolution of 5 km (Verlaan et al. 2015) and used to develop 
a global climatology of ESLs due to the combination of storm surge and 
tide (Muis et al. 2016). A global modelling study ﬁnds that under SLR 
of 0.5–10 m, changes to astronomical tidal mean high water exceed 
the imposed SLR by 10% or more at around 10% of coastal cities 
when coastlines are held ﬁxed. When coastal recession is permitted 
a reduction in tidal range occurs due to changes in the period of 
oscillation of the basin under the changed coastline morphology 
(Pickering et  al. 2017). A recent study on global probabilistic 
projections of ESLs considering MSL, tides, wind-waves and storm 
surges shows that under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the global average 
100-year ESL is very likely to increase by 34–76 cm and 58–172 cm, 
respectively between 2000–2100 (Vousdoukas et al. 2018). Despite 
the advancements in global tide and surge modelling, using CMIP 
GCM multi-model ensembles to examine the effects of future 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks

weather and circulation changes on storm surges in a globally 
consistent way is still a challenge because of the low conﬁdence in 
GCMs being able to represent small scale weather systems such as 
TCs. To date only a small number of higher resolution GCMs are able 
to produce credible cyclone climatologies (e.g., Murakami et al. 2012) 
although this will probably improve with further GCM development 
and increases to GCM resolution (Walsh et al. 2016). 
The role of austral winter swell waves on ESL have been investigated 
in the Gulf of Guinea (Melet et  al. 2016) and the Maldives 
(Wadey et al. 2017). Multivariate statistical analysis and probabilistic 
modelling is used to show that ﬂood risk in the northern Gulf of 
Mexico is higher than determined from short observational records 
(Wahl et  al. 2016). In Australia, changes in ESLs were modelled 
using four CMIP5 RCP8.5 simulations (Colberg et  al. 2019). On 
the southern mainland coast, the southward movement of the 
subtropical ridge in the climate models led to small reductions (up 
to 0.4 m) in the modelled 20-year (5% probability of occurring 
in a year) storm surge. Over the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north, 
changes were largest and positive during austral summer in two 
out of the four models in response to a possible eastward shift in 
the northwest monsoon. Synthetic cyclone modelling was used to 
evaluate probabilities, interannual variability and future changes of 
extreme water levels from tides and TC-induced storm surge (storm 
tide) along the coastlines of Fiji (McInnes et al. 2014) and Samoa 
(McInnes et al. 2016). Higher resolution modelling for Apia, Samoa 
incorporating waves highlights that although SLR reduces wave 
setup and wind setup by 10–20%, during storm surges it increases 
wave energy reaching the shore by up to 200% (Hoeke et al. 2015).
In the German Bight, Arns et  al. (2015) show that under SLR, 
increases in extreme water levels occur due to a change in phase of 
tidal propagation; which more than compensates for a reduction in 
storm surge due to deeper coastal sea levels. Vousdoukas et al. (2017) 
develop ESL projections for Europe that account for changes in waves 
and storm surge. In 2100, increases of up to 0.35 m relative to the 
SLR projections occur towards the end of the century under RCP8.5 
along the North Sea coasts of northern Germany and Denmark and 
the Baltic Sea coast, whereas little to negative change is found for 
the southern European coasts. 
In the USA, Garner et  al. (2017) combine downscaled TCs, storm 
surge models, and probabilistic SLR projections to assess ﬂood hazard 
associated with changing storm characteristics and SLR in New York City 
from the pre-industrial era to 2300. Increased storm intensity was found 
to compensate for offshore shifts in storm tracks leading to minimal 
change in modelled storm surge heights through 2300. However, 
projected SLR leads to large increases in future overall ﬂood heights 
associated with TCs in New York City. Consequently, ﬂood height return 
periods that were ~500y (0.2% probability of occurring in a given 
year) during the pre-industrial era have fallen to ~25y (4% probability 
of occurring annually) at present and are projected to fall to ~5y 
(20% probability of occurring annually) within the next three decades.
In summary, new studies on observed wave climate change from 
1985–2018 showed small increases in signiﬁcant wave height of 
+0.3  cm/year and larger increases in 90th percentile wave heights 
of +1 cm/year in the Southern Ocean and +0.8 cm/year in the North 
Atlantic ocean (medium conﬁdence). Sea ice loss in the Arctic has 
also increased wave heights over the period 1992–2014 (medium 
conﬁdence). Global wave power has increased over the last six decades 
with differences across oceans related to long-term correlations with 
SST (low conﬁdence). Future projections indicate an increase of the 
mean signiﬁcant wave height across the Southern Ocean and tropical 
eastern Paciﬁc (high conﬁdence) and Baltic Sea (medium conﬁdence) 
and decrease over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea under 
RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence). Extreme waves are projected to increase in the 
Southern Ocean and decrease in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean 
Sea under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence). There is still limited 
knowledge on projected wave period and direction. For coastal ESLs, 
new studies at the regional to global scale have generally had a greater 
focus on multiple contributing factors such as waves, tides, storm 
surges and SLR. At the global scale, probabilistic projections of extreme 
sea levels considering these factors projects the global average 100-
year ESL is very likely to increase by 34–76 cm and 58–172 cm, under 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively between 2000–2100.
6.3.2 
Impacts
As shown in previous assessments, increasing exposure is a major 
driver of increased cyclone risk (wind damages), as well as ﬂood 
risk associated with cyclone rainfall and surge, besides possible 
changes in hazard intensities from anthropogenic climate change 
(Handmer et al. 2012; Arent et al. 2014). Changes in TC trajectories 
are potentially a major source of increased risk, as the degree of 
vulnerability is typically much higher in locations that were previously 
not exposed to the hazard (Noy, 2016). Typhoon Haiyan’s move to 
the south of the usual trajectories of TCs in the western North Paciﬁc 
basin (Yonson et  al. 2018) made the evacuation more difﬁcult as 
people were less willing to heed storm surge warnings they received. 
Abrupt changes in impacts therefore are not only determined by 
changes in cyclone hazard, but also by the sensitivity or tipping 
points that are crossed in terms of ﬂooding for instance, that 
can be driven by SLR but also by changes in local exposure. The 
frequency of nuisance ﬂooding along the US east coast is expected 
to accelerate further in the future (Sweet and Park, 2014). The loss 
of coral reef cover and mangrove forests have also been shown to 
increase damages from storm surge events (e.g., Beck et al. 2018). 
Cyclones also affect marine life, habitats and ﬁshing. There is some 
evidence that ﬁsh may evacuate storm areas or be redistributed by 
storm waves and currents (FAO, 2018; Sainsbury et al. 2018). Other 
examples of damage to ﬁsheries from cyclones and storm surges can 
be found in FAO (2018: Chapter V, Table 1).
With regard to property losses, according to most projections, 
increasing losses from more intense cyclones are not offset by 
a possible reduction in frequency (Handmer et al. 2012). While the 
relation between aggregate damages and frequency may be linear, the 
relationship between intensity and damages is most probably highly 
nonlinear; with research suggesting a 10% increase in wind speed 
associated with a 30–40% increase in damages (e.g., Strobl, 2012). 
Although it is clear that direct damages from cyclones could

increase, investigations into the economic impact of past cyclone 
events is less common, as these are much more difﬁcult to identify. 
Examples of such work include Strobl (2012) on hurricane impacts 
in the Caribbean, Haque and Jahan (2016) on TC Sidr in Bangladesh, 
Jakobsen (2012) on Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua, and Taupo and 
Noy (2017) on TC Pam in Tuvalu. The relation between changes in 
TCs and property losses is complex, and there are indications that 
wind shear changes may have larger impact than changes in global 
temperatures (Wang and Toumi, 2016). With regard to loss of life, 
total fatalities and mortality from cyclone-related coastal ﬂooding is 
globally declining, probably as a result of improved forecasting and 
evacuation, although in some low-income countries mortality is still 
high (Paul, 2009; Lumbroso et al. 2017; Bouwer and Jonkman, 2018). 
A global analysis ﬁnds that despite adaptation efforts, further SLR 
could increase storm surge mortality in many parts of the developing 
world (Lloyd et al. 2016). 
An assessment of future changes in coastal impacts based on direct 
downscaling of indicators of ﬂooding such as total water level and 
number of hours per year with breakwater overtopping over a given 
threshold for port operability is provided by Camus et al. (2017). These 
indicators are multivariable and include the combined effect of SLR, 
storm surge, astronomical tide and waves. Regional projected wave 
climate is downscaled from global multi-model projections from 
30 CMIP5 model realisations. For example, projections by 2100 under 
the RCP8.5 scenario show a spatial variability along the coast of 
Chile with port operability loss between 600–800 h yr–1 and around 
200 h yr–1 relative to present (1979–2005) conditions. Although wave 
changes are included in projected overtopping distributions, future 
changes of operability are mainly due to the SLR contribution.
6.3.3 
Risk Management and Adaptation
The most effective risk management strategy in the last few decades 
has been the development of early warning systems for cyclones 
(Hallegatte, 2013). Generally, however, a lack of familiarity with the 
changed nature of storms prevails. Powerful storms often generate 
record storm surges (Needham et al. 2015), such as in the cases of 
Cyclone Nargis and Typhoon Haiyan but surge warnings had been less 
well understood and followed because they had tended to be new or 
rare to the locality (Lagmay et al. 2015). A US study on storm surge 
warnings highlights the issue of the right timing to warn, as well as 
the difﬁculty in delivering accurate surge maps (Morrow et al. 2015). 
Previous experience with warnings that were not followed by hazard 
events show the ‘crying wolf’ problem leading many to ignore future 
warnings (Bostrom et al. 2018).
There is scant literature on the management of storms that 
follow less common trajectories. The most recent and relatively 
well-studied ones are Superstorm Sandy in 2012 in the USA and 
Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 in the Philippines. These two storms were 
unexpected and having underestimated the levels of impact, people 
ignored warnings and evacuation directives. In the case of Typhoon 
Haiyan, the dissemination of warnings via scripted text messages 
were ineffective without an explanation of the difference between 
Haiyan’s accompanying storm surge and that of other ‘normal’ 
storms to which people were used to (Lejano et al. 2016). Negative 
experiences of previous evacuations also lead to the reluctance of 
authorities to issue mandatory evacuation orders, for example, 
during Superstorm Sandy (Kulkarni et al. 2017), and contributes to 
a preventable high number of casualties (Dalisay and De Guzman, 
2016). These examples also show that saving lives and assets through 
warning and evacuation is limited. Providing biophysical protection 
measures as well as improving self-reliance during such events can 
complement warning and evacuation. 
After the storms, retreat or rebuild options exist. Rebuilding options 
can depend on whether insurance is still affordable after the event. 
Buyout programs, a form of ‘managed retreat’ whereby government 
agencies pay people affected by extreme weather events to relocate 
to safer areas, gained traction in recent years as a potential solution 
to reduce exposure to changing storm surge and ﬂood risk. The 
decision to  retreat or rebuild in situ depends, at least partially, on 
how communities have recovered in the past and therefore on the 
perceived success of a future recovery (Binder, 2014). However, 
political and jurisdictional conﬂicts between local, regional, and 
national government over land management responsibilities, lack 
of coordinated nation-wide adaptation plans, and clashes between 
individual and community needs have led to some unpopular buyout 
programs after Hurricane Sandy (Boet-Whitaker, 2017). Relocation 
(i.e., managed retreat) is often very controversial, can incur signiﬁcant 
political risk even when it is in principle voluntary (Gibbs et al. 2016), 
and is rarely implemented with much success at larger scales (Beine 
and Parsons, 2015; Hino et al. 2017). In addition, managed retreats are 
often fraught with legal, distributional and human rights issues, as seen 
in the case of resettlements after Typhoon Haiyan (Thomas, 2015; see 
also Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1), and extend to loss of cultural 
heritage and indigenous qualities in the case of small island states. 
If rebuilding in situ is pursued after catastrophic events and without 
decreased exposure, it is often accompanied by actions that aim 
to reduce vulnerability in order to adapt to the increasing risk 
(Harman et al. 2013). In many cases, resilient designs and sustainable 
urban plans integrating climate change concerns, that are inclusive 
of vegetation barriers as coastal defences and hybrid designs, are 
considered (Cheong et al. 2013; Saleh and Weinstein, 2016). However, 
often more physical structures that are known to be less sustainable 
in the long-term, but potentially more protective in the short-term, 
are constructed (Knowlton and Rotkin-Ellman, 2014; Rosenzweig 
and Solecki, 2014). Anticipatory planning approaches are under way 
to warn and enable decision making in time (Bloemen et al. 2018; 
Lawrence et al. 2018).
6.4 
Marine Heatwaves and their Implications
AR5 concluded that it is virtually certain that the global ocean 
temperature in the upper few hundred meters has increased from 
1971–2010 (Rhein et al. 2013), and that the temperature is projected 
to further increase during the 21st century (Collins et al. 2013). For 
an update on observed and projected long-term changes in ocean 
temperature and heat, see Chapter 5. 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks 
Chapter 6

607
Superimposed onto the long-term ocean warming trend are short-
term extreme warming events, called MHWs, during which ocean 
temperatures are extremely high. Whereas the response of marine 
organisms and ecosystems to gradual trends in temperature 
has been assessed in AR5 (e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 2014; 
Pörtner et al. 2014), research on the response of the natural, physical 
and socioeconomic systems to MHWs has newly emerged since AR5. 
Notable exceptions are studies on the effect of MHWs on intertidal 
systems and tropical coral reef ecosystems, which have been already 
assessed in AR5 (Gattuso et al. 2014; Pörtner et al. 2014).
MHWs are periods of extremely high ocean temperatures that persist 
for days to months, can extend up to thousands of kilometres and 
can penetrate multiple hundreds of metres into the deep ocean 
(see SROCC Glossary; Hobday et  al. 2016a; Scannell et  al. 2016; 
Benthuysen et al. 2018). A MHW is an event at a particular place and 
time of the year that is rare and predominately, but not exclusively, 
deﬁned with a relative threshold; that is, an event rarer than 90th 
or 99th percentile of a probability density function. By deﬁnition, 
the characteristics of what is called a MHW may therefore vary 
from place to place in an absolute sense. Different metrics are used 
to quantify changes in MHW characteristics, such as frequency, 
duration, intensity, spatial extent and severity. To monitor and 
predict coral bleaching risk, the metric degree heating week (DHW; 
e.g., Eakin et al. 2010) is often used, which combines the effect of 
duration and magnitude of the heatwave. 
6.4.1 
Observations and Key Processes, Detection  
and Attribution, Projections 
6.4.1.1 
Recent Documented MHWs and Key 
Driving Mechanisms
MHWs have been observed and documented in all ocean basins over 
the last two decades (Figure 6.3a, Figure 6.2, Table 6.2). Prominent 
examples include the Northeast Paciﬁc 2013–2015 MHW (often 
called ‘The Blob’; Bond et al. 2015), the Yellow Sea/East China Sea 
2016 MHW (KMA, 2016; KMA, 2017; KMA, 2018), the Western 
Australia 2011 MHW (Pearce and Feng, 2013; Kataoka et al. 2014), 
and the Northwest Atlantic 2012 MHW (Mills et al. 2013).
The dominant ocean and/or atmospheric processes leading to the 
buildup, persistence and decay of MHWs vary greatly among the 
individual MHWs and depend on the location and time of occurrence. 
One of the most important global driver of MHWs are El Niño events 
(Oliver et al. 2018a). During El Niño events, the SST, in particular of 
the central and eastern equatorial Paciﬁc and the Indian Ocean, are 
anomalously warm (see Section 6.5). MHWs may also be associated 
with other large-scale modes of climate variability, such as the Paciﬁc 
Decadal Oscillation (PDO), AMO, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), North 
Paciﬁc Oscillation and NAO, which modulate ocean temperatures at 
the regional scale (Benthuysen et al. 2014; Bond et al. 2015; Chen et al. 
2015b; Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016). These modes can change the 
strength, direction and location of ocean currents that build up areas 
of extreme warm waters, or they can change the air-sea heat ﬂux, 
leading to a warming of the ocean surface from the atmosphere. 
For example, predominant La Niña conditions in 2010 and 2011 
strengthened and shifted the Leeuwin Current southward along the 
west coast of Australia leading to the Western Australia 2011 MHW 
(Pearce and Feng, 2013; Kataoka et al. 2014). Another example is The 
Blob, which emerged in 2013 in response to teleconnections between 
the North Paciﬁc and the weak El Niño that drove strong positive 
sea level pressure anomalies across the northeast Paciﬁc inducing 
a smaller heat loss from the ocean (Bond et al. 2015; Di Lorenzo and 
Mantua, 2016). Low sea ice concentrations in the Arctic, however, 
may have also played a role (Lee et al. 2015a). 
The buildup and decay of extreme warm SSTs may also be caused 
by small-scale atmospheric and oceanic processes, such as ocean 
mesoscale eddies or local atmospheric weather patterns (Carrigan 
and Puotinen, 2014; Schlegel et al. 2017a; Schlegel et al. 2017b). For 
example, the Tasman Sea 2015–2016 MHW was caused by enhanced 
southward transport in the East Australian current driven by increased 
wind stress curl across the mid-latitude South Paciﬁc (Oliver and 
Holbrook, 2014; Oliver et al. 2017) with local downwelling-favourable 
winds also having played a role in the subsurface intensiﬁcation of 
the MHW (Schaeffer and Roughan, 2017). In addition, the 2016 MHW 
in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef was mitigated by the 
ETC Winston that passed over Fiji on February 20th. The cyclone 
caused strong winds, cloud cover and rain, which lowered SST and 
prevented corals from bleaching (Hughes et al. 2017b). 
6.4.1.2 
Detection and Attribution of MHW Events
The upper ocean temperature has signiﬁcantly increased in most 
regions over the last few decades, with anthropogenic forcing very 
likely being the main driver (Bindoff et al. 2013). Concurrent with the 
long-term increase in upper ocean temperatures, MHWs have become 
more frequent, extensive and intense (Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018; 
Oliver et al. 2018a; Smale et al. 2019). Analysis of satellite daily SST data 
reveal that the number of MHW days exceeding the 99th percentile, 
calculated over the 1982–2016 period, has doubled globally between 
1982 and 2016, from about 2.5 heatwave days yr–1 to 5 heatwave 
days yr–1 (Frölicher et al. 2018; Oliver et al. 2018a). At the same time, 
the maximum intensity of MHWs has increased by 0.15ºC and the 
spatial extent by 66% (Frölicher et  al. 2018). Using a classiﬁcation 
system to separate MHWs into categories (I-IV, depending on the level 
to which SSTs exceed local averages), Hobday et al. (2018) show that 
the occurrence of MHWs has increased for all categories over the past 
35 years with the largest increase (24%) in strong (Category II) MHW 
events. In 2016, about a quarter of the surface ocean experienced either 
the longest or most intense MHW (Hobday et al. 2016a; Figure 6.3b). 
The observed trend towards more frequent, intense and extensive 
MHWs, deﬁned relative to a ﬁxed baseline period, is very likely due 
to the long-term anthropogenic increase in mean ocean temperatures, 
and cannot be explained by natural climate variability (Frölicher et al. 
2018; Oliver et al. 2018a; Oliver, 2019). As climate models project a long-
term increase in ocean temperatures over the 21st century (Collins et al. 
2013), a further increase in the probability of MHWs under continued 
global warming can be expected (see Section 6.4.1.3). Extending the 
analysis to the pre-satellite period (before 1982) by using a combination 
of daily in situ measurements and gridded monthly in situ based data 
Chapter 6 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks
6
608
sets, Oliver et al. (2018a) show that the global frequency and duration 
of MHWs have increased since 1925. At regional scale, MHWs have 
become more common in 38% of the world’s coastal ocean over the 
last few decades (Lima and Wethey, 2012). In tropical reef systems, 
the interval between recurrent MHWs and associated coral bleaching 
events has diminished steadily since 1980, from once every 25 to 
30 years in early 1980s to once every 6 years in 2016 (Hughes et al. 
2018a). Due to the scarcity of below surface temperature data with 
high temporal and spatial resolution, it is currently unknown if and how 
MHWs at depth have changed over the past decades. 
Several attribution studies (summarised in Table 6.2) have investigated 
if the likelihood of individual MHW events has changed due to 
anthropogenic warming. On a global scale and at present day (2006–
2015), climate models suggest that 84–90% (very likely range) of all 
globally occurring MHWs are attributable to the temperature increase 
since 1850–1900 (Fischer and Knutti,  2015; Frölicher et  al. 2018). 
Attribution studies on individual MHW events show that the intensity 
of the western tropical Paciﬁc MHW in 2014 (Weller et al. 2015), the 
intensity of the Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW (Oliver et al. 2018b; Walsh 
et al. 2018) and the extreme SSTs in the central equatorial Paciﬁc 
in 2015–2016 can be fully attributed to anthropogenic warming. 
In other words, the aforementioned studies show that such events 
could not have occurred without the temperature increase since 
1850–1900. In addition, extreme SSTs in the northeast Paciﬁc in 2014 
have become about ﬁve times more likely with human-induced global 
warming (Wang et al. 2014a; Kam et al. 2015; Weller et al. 2015). The 
Tasman Sea 2015–2016 MHW was 330 times (for duration) and 6.8 
times (for intensity) more likely with anthropogenic climate change 
than without (Oliver et al. 2017), and the northern Australia 2016 
MHW was up to ﬁfty times more likely due to anthropogenic climate 
change (Weller et  al. 2015; King  et  al. 2017; Lewis and Mallela, 
2018; Newman et al. 2018; Oliver et al. 2018b). Also the risk of the 
Great Barrier Reef bleaching event in 2016 was increased due to 
anthropogenic climate change (King et al. 2017; Lewis and Mallela, 
2018). Even though natural variability is still needed for the events 
to occur, these studies show that most of the individual MHW events 
analysed so far have a clear human-induced signal. However, such 
attribution studies have not been undertaken for all major individual 
MHW events yet (e.g., ﬁve out of ten MHWs indicated in Figure 6.3a 
have not been assessed), and it is therefore still unknown for some of 
the observed individual MHW events if they have an anthropogenic 
signal or not (labelled as ‘unknown’ in Figure 6.3a).

We conclude that it is very likely that MHWs have increased in 
frequency, duration and intensity since pre-industrial (1850–1900), 
and that between 2006–2015 most MHWs (84–90%; very likely 
range) are attributable to the temperature increase since 1850–1900. 
Only few studies on the attribution of individual MHW events exist, 
but they all point to human inﬂuence on recent MHW events. 
6.4.1.3 
Future Changes
MHWs will increase in frequency, duration, spatial extent and 
intensity throughout the ocean under future global warming 
(Oliver et al. 2017; Ramírez and Briones, 2017; Alexander et al. 2018; 
Frölicher et  al. 2018; Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018; Darmaraki 
et al. 2019). Projections based on 12 CMIP5 Earth system models 
suggest that, on global scale, the probability of MHWs exceeding the 
pre-industrial (1850–1900) 99th percentile will very likely increase 
by a factor of 20–27 by 2031–2050 and very likely by a factor of 
46–55 by 2081–2100 under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas (GHG) 
scenario (Figure 6.4a; Frölicher et al. 2018). In other words, a one-in-
hundred-day event at pre-industrial levels is projected to become a 
one-in-four-day event by 2031–2050 and a one-in-two-day event by 
2081–2100. The duration of MHW is projected to very likely increase 
from 8–10 days at 1850–1900, to 126–152 days in 2081–2100 
under the RCP8.5 scenario (Frölicher et  al. 2018). The maximum 
intensity (maximum exceedance of the 1850–1900 99th percentile) 
will very likely increase from 0.3ºC–0.4ºC in 1850–1900, to 3.1ºC–
3.8ºC in 2081–2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Under the RCP2.6 
scenario, the magnitude of changes in the different MHW metrics 
would be substantially reduced (Frölicher et al. 2018). For example, 
the probability ratio would very likely increase by a factor of 16–24 
by 2081–2100 for RCP2.6; less than half of that is projected for the 
RCP8.5. The magnitude of changes in the probability ratio scales with 
global mean atmospheric surface temperature and is independent 
of the warming path (Figure 6.4b), that is, it does not depend on 
whether a particular warming level is reached sooner (RCP8.5) or 
later (RCP2.6).
The projected changes in MHWs will not be globally uniform. CMIP5 
models project that the largest increases in the probability of MHWs 
will occur in the tropical ocean, especially in the western tropical 
Paciﬁc, and the Arctic Ocean (Figure 6.4c,d), and that most of the 
large marine ecosystems will also experience large increases in the

Figure 6.4 |  Global and regional changes in the probability ratio of marine heatwaves (MHWs). The probability ratio is the fraction by which the number of MHW 
days yr–1 has changed since 1850–1900. (a) Changes in the annual mean probability ratio of MHWs exceeding the 99th percentile of pre-industrial local daily sea 
surface temperature (SST) averaged over the ocean. The thick lines represent the multi-model averages of 12 climate models that participated in the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) covering the 1861–2100 period for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios, respectively. 
The shaded bands indicate the 90% conﬁdence interval of the standard error of the mean. The black line shows an observational-based estimate. As daily SST data are 
available only for the 1982–2016 period, we assume that the observed mean temperature change is the main cause of the change in frequency of extremes (Frölicher et al. 
2018; Oliver, 2019). We therefore subtracted ﬁrst the differences between 1854–1900 and 1982–2016 obtained from the extended reconstructed SST Version 4 dataset 
(ERSSTv4; Huang et al. 2015a) from the daily satellite data before calculating the 99th percentile for the observations. (b) Same as (a), but the probability ratio is plotted 
for different levels of global surface atmospheric warming and for the individual models. The simulated time series in (b) are smoothed with a 10-year running mean. 
(c,d) Simulated regional changes in the multi-model mean probability ratio of MHWs exceeding the preindustrial 99th percentile in 2081–2100 for the (c) RCP2.6 scenario 
and the (d) RCP8.5 scenario. The grey contours in (c,d) highlight the spatial pattern. Figure is modiﬁed from Frölicher et al. (2018).

number of MHW days (Alexander et al. 2018; Frölicher et al. 2018). 
Smallest increases are projected for the Southern Ocean. In addition, 
MHW events in the Great Barrier Reef, such as the one associated with 
the bleaching in 2016, are projected to be at least twice as frequent 
under 2ºC global warming than they are today (King et al. 2017). The 
magnitude of projected changes at the local scale is uncertain, partly 
due to issues of horizontal and vertical resolution of CMIP5-type Earth 
system models. Only a few studies have used higher resolution oceanic 
models (eddy-resolving) to assess the local-to-regional changes in 
MHW characteristics. For example, regional high-resolution coupled 
climate model simulations suggest that the Mediterranean Sea will 
experience at least one long lasting MHW every year by the end of 
the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario (Darmaraki et al. 2019), 
and eddy-resolving ocean model simulations project a further increase 
in the likelihood of extreme temperature events in the Tasman Sea 
(Oliver et al. 2014; Oliver et al. 2015; Oliver et al. 2017). 
Most of the global changes in the probability of MHWs, when 
deﬁned relative to a ﬁxed temperature climatology and using coarse 
resolution CMIP5-type climate models, are driven by the global-scale 
shift in the mean ocean temperature (Alexander et al. 2018; Frölicher 
et  al. 2018). However, previously ice-covered regions, such as the 
Arctic Ocean, will exhibit larger SST variability under future global 
warming. This is because of an enhanced SST increase in summer 
due to sea ice retreat, but SST remaining near the freezing point in 
winter (Carton et al. 2015; Alexander et al. 2018). When contrasting 
the changes in the probability of MHWs with land-based heatwaves 
(Fischer and Knutti, 2015), it is evident that MHWs are projected to 
occur more frequently (Frölicher et al. 2018; Frölicher and Laufkötter, 
2018). This is because the temperature variability is much smaller 
in ocean surface waters than in the atmosphere (Frölicher and 
Laufkötter, 2018). 
We conclude that there is very high conﬁdence that MHWs will increase 
in frequency, duration, spatial extent and intensity in all ocean basins 
under future global warming, mainly because of an increase in mean 
ocean temperature. However, higher resolution models are needed to 
make robust projections at the local-to-regional scale. 
6.4.2 
Impacts on Natural, Physical and Human Systems 
6.4.2.1 
Impacts on Marine Organisms and Ecosystems
Temperature plays an essential role in the biology and ecology of marine 
organisms (e.g., Pörtner, 2002; Pörtner and Knust, 2007; Poloczanska 
et al. 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2014), and therefore extreme high 
ocean temperature can have large impacts on marine ecosystems. 
Recent studies show that MHWs have strongly impacted marine 
organisms and ecosystem services in all ocean basins (Smale et al. 2019) 
over the last two decades. Impacts include coral bleaching and 
mortality (Hughes et  al. 2017b; Hughes  et  al.  2018a; Hughes et  al. 
2018b), loss of seagrass and kelp forests (Smale et al. 2019), shifts in 
species range (Smale and Wernberg, 2013), and local (Wernberg et al. 
2013; Wernberg et al. 2016) and potentially global extinctions of coral 
species (Brainard et al. 2011). 
A growing number of studies have reported that MHWs negatively 
affect corals and coral reefs through bleaching, disease, and mortality 
(see Chapter 5 for an extensive discussion on coral reefs and coral 
bleaching). The recent (2014–2017) high ocean temperatures in 
the tropics and subtropics triggered a pan-tropical episode of 
unprecedented mass bleaching of corals (100s of km2), the third 
global-scale event after 1997–1998 and 2010 (Heron et  al. 2016; 
Eakin et al. 2017; Hughes et al. 2017b; Eakin et al. 2018; Hughes et al. 
2018a). The heat stress during this event was sufﬁcient to cause 
bleaching at 75% of global reefs (Hughes et al. 2018a; Figure 6.3b) 
and mortality at 30% (Eakin et  al. 2017), much more than any 
previously documented global bleaching event. In some locations, 
many reefs bleached extensively for the ﬁrst time on record, and over 
half of the reefs bleached multiple times during the three year event. 
However, there were distinct geographical variations in bleaching, 
mainly determined by the spatial pattern and magnitude of the MHW 
(Figure 6.3b). For example, bleaching was extensive and severe in the 
northern regions of the Great Barrier Reef, with 93% of the northern 
Australian Great Barrier Reef coral suffering bleaching in 2016, but 
impacts were moderate at the southern coral reefs of the Great 
Barrier Reef (Brainard et al. 2018; Stuart-Smith et al. 2018). 
Apart from strong impacts on corals, recent MHWs have demonstrated 
their potential impacts on other marine ecosystems and ecosystems 
services (Ummenhofer and Meehl, 2017; Smale et al. 2019). Two of 
the best studied MHWs with extensive ecological implications are the 
Western Australia 2011 MHW and the Northeast Paciﬁc 2013–2015 
MHW. The Western Australia 2011 MHW resulted in a regime shift of 
the temperate reef ecosystem (Wernberg et al. 2013; Wernberg et al. 
2016). The abundance of the dominant habitat-forming seaweeds 
Scytohalia dorycara and Ecklonia radiata became signiﬁcantly 
reduced and Ecklonia kelp forest was replaced by small turf-forming 
algae with wide ranging impacts on associated sessile invertebrates 
and demersal ﬁsh. The sea grass Amphibolis antarctica in Shark Bay 
underwent defoliation after the MHW (Fraser et al. 2014), and together 
with the loss of other sea grass species, these lead to releases of 
2–9 Tg  CO2 to the atmosphere during the subsequent three years 
after the MHW (Arias-Ortiz et al. 2018). In addition, coral bleaching 
and adverse impacts on invertebrate ﬁsheries were documented 
(Depczynski et  al. 2013; Caputi et  al. 2016). The Northeast Paciﬁc 
2013–2015 MHW also caused extensive alterations to open ocean and 
coastal ecosystems (Cavole et al. 2016). Impacts included increased 
mortality events of sea birds (Jones et al. 2018), salmon and marine 
mammals (Cavole et al. 2016), very low ocean primary productivity 
(Whitney, 2015; Jacox et al. 2016), an increase in warm water copepod 
species (Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016) and novel species compositions 
(Peterson et al. 2017). In addition, a coast wide bloom of the toxigenic 
diatom Pseudo-nitzschia resulted in the largest ever recorded outbreak 
of domoic acid along the North American west coast (McCabe et al. 
2016). Domoic acid was detected in many marine mammals, such as 
whales, dolphins, porpoises, seals and sea lions. The elevated toxins in 
commercially harvested ﬁsh and invertebrates resulted in prolonged 
and geographically extensive closure of razor clam and crab ﬁsheries. 
Other MHWs also demonstrated the vulnerability of marine organisms 
and ecosystems to extremely high ocean temperatures. The Northwest 
Atlantic 2012 MHW strongly impacted coastal ecosystems by causing 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks

a northward movement of warm water species and local migrations 
of some species (e.g., lobsters) earlier in the season (Mills et al. 2013; 
Pershing et  al. 2015). The Mediterranean Sea 2003 MHW lead to 
mass mortalities of macro-invertebrate species (Garrabou et  al. 
2009) and the Tasman Sea 2015–2016 MHW had impacts on 
sessile, sedentary and cultured species in the shallow, near-shore 
environment including outbreaks of disease in commercially viable 
species (Oliver et al. 2017). Vibrio outbreaks were also observed in 
the Baltic Sea in response to elevated SSTs (Baker-Austin et al. 2013). 
The Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW favoured some phytoplankton species, 
leading to harmful algal blooms, shellﬁsh poisoning events and 
mortality events in seabirds (Walsh et al. 2018; see chapter 3 for more 
details). Also, lower than average size of multiple groundﬁsh species 
were observed including Pollock, Paciﬁc cod, and Chinook salmon 
(Zador and Siddon, 2016). The Yellow Sea/East China Sea 2016 MHW 
killed a large number of different marine organisms in coastal and bay 
areas around South Korea (Kim and Han, 2017) and the Southwest 
Atlantic 2017 MHW lead to toxic algal blooms (Manta et al. 2018). 
The Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW affected anchovies, which showed 
decreased fat content and early spawning as a reproductive strategy 
(IMPARPE, 2017), a  behaviour usually seen during warm El  Niño 
conditions (Ñiquen and Bouchon, 2004). 
Based on the examples described above we conclude with very high 
conﬁdence that a range of organisms and ecosystems have been 
impacted by MHWs across all ocean basins over the last two decades. 
Given that MHWs will very likely increase in intensity and frequency 
with further climate warming, we conclude with high conﬁdence that 
this will push some marine organisms, ﬁsheries and ecosystem beyond 
the limits of their resilience. These impacts will occur on top of those 
expected from a progressive shift in global mean ocean temperatures. 
6.4.2.2 
Impacts on the Physical System 
MHWs can impact weather patterns over land via teleconnections 
causing drought, heavy precipitation or heat wave events. For 
example, the Northeast Paciﬁc 2013–2015 MHW and the associated 
persistent atmospheric high-pressure ridge prevented normal winter 
storms from reaching the West Coast of the US and may have 
contributed to the drought conditions across the entire West Coast 
(Seager et al. 2015; Di Lorenzo and Mantua, 2016). The Tasman Sea 
2015–2016 MHW has increased the intensity of rainfall that caused 
ﬂooding in northeast Tasmania in January 2016 (see Box 6.1) and 
the Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW caused heavy rainfall and ﬂooding 
on the west coast of tropical South America (ENFEN, 2017; Echevin 
et al. 2018; Garreaud, 2018; Takahashi et al. 2018). Similarly, MHWs 
in the Mediterranean Sea may have ampliﬁed heatwaves (Feudale 
and Shukla, 2007; García-Herrera et al. 2010) and heavy precipitation 
events over central Europe (Messmer et al. 2017), as well as trigger 
intense ETCs over the Mediterranean Sea (González-Alemán et al. 
2019). Such physical changes induced by MHWs may then also affect 
ecosystems and human systems on land (Reimer et al. 2015). 
It should be noted that past and future impacts of MHWs on weather 
patterns over land depend not only on the duration and intensity of 
MHWs, but also on a wide range of different additional processes 
in the climate system such as the large-scale circulation of the 
atmosphere and oceans, and changes in the mean climate. Therefore, 
we conclude that there is currently low conﬁdence in how MHWs 
impact the weather systems over land. 
6.4.2.3 
Impacts on the Human System 
MHWs can also lead to signiﬁcant socioeconomic ramiﬁcations when 
affecting aquaculture or important ﬁshery species, or when triggering 
heavy rain or drought events on land. The Northwest Atlantic 2012 
MHW, for example, had major economic impacts on the US lobster 
industry in 2015 (Mills et al. 2013). The MHWs lead to changes in 
lobster ﬁshing practices and harvest patterns, because the lobsters 
moved from the deep offshore waters into shallower coastal areas 
much earlier in the season than usual causing a rapid rise in lobster 
catch rates. Together with a supply chain bottleneck, the record 
catch outstripped market demand and contributed to a collapse in 
lobster prices (Mills et al. 2013). Even though high catch volumes 
were reported, the price collapse threatened the economic viability of 
many US and Canadian lobster ﬁsheries. Economic impacts through 
changes in ﬁsheries were also reported during the Northeast Paciﬁc 
2013–2015 MHW and the Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW. The Northeast 
Paciﬁc 2013–2015 MHW led to closing of both commercial and 
recreational ﬁsheries resulting in millions of USD in losses among 
ﬁshing industries (Cavole et al. 2016). In addition, the toxin produced 
by the harmful algal blooms can be transferred through the marine 
food web and humans who eat contaminated ﬁsh, shellﬁsh or 
crustaceans (Berdalet et al. 2016; Du et al. 2016; McCabe et al. 2016). 
The ingestion of such contaminated seafood products, the inhalation 
of aerosolised toxins or the skin contact with toxin-contaminated 
water may cause toxicity in humans. Symptoms in human associated 
with the ingestion of the contaminated seafood range from mild 
gastrointestinal distress to seizures, coma, permanent short-term 
memory loss and death (Perl et  al. 1990). The ecological changes 
associated with the Alaskan Sea 2016 MHW impacted subsistence 
and commercial activities. For example, ice-based harvesting of seals, 
crabs and ﬁsh in western Alaska was delayed due to the lack of 
winter sea ice. MHWs can also impact the socioeconomic and human 
system through changes to weather patterns. For example, heavy rain 
associated with the Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW triggered numerous 
landslides and ﬂooding, which resulted in a death toll of several 
hundred, and widespread damage to infrastructure and civil works 
(United Nations, 2017).
Studies on the impact of MHWs on human systems are still relatively 
scarce, even though many show negative impacts on human health 
and economy. We therefore conclude with medium conﬁdence that 
MHWs can negatively impact human health and economy. 
6.4.3 
Risk Management and Adaptation, 
Monitoring and Early Warning Systems
Risk management strategies to respond to MHWs include early 
warning systems as well as seasonal (weeks to several months) and 
multi-annual predictions systems. Since 1997, the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch has 
used satellite SST data to provide near real-time warning of coral

bleaching (Liu et  al. 2014a). These satellite-based products, along 
with NOAA Coral Reef Watch’s four month coral bleaching outlook 
based on operational climate forecast models (Liu et  al. 2018), 
and coral disease outbreak risk (Heron et al. 2010) provide critical 
guidance to coral reef managers, scientists, and other stakeholders 
(Tommasi et al. 2017b; Eakin et al. 2018). These products are also 
used to implement proactive bleaching response plans (Rosinski et al. 
2017), brief stakeholders, and allocate monitoring resources in 
advance of bleaching events, such as the 2014–2017 global coral 
bleaching event (Eakin et  al. 2017). For example, Thailand closed 
ten reefs for diving in advance of the bleaching peak in 2016, while 
Hawaii immediately began preparation of resources both to monitor 
the 2015 bleaching and to place specimens of rare corals in climate 
controlled, onshore nurseries in response to these forecast systems 
(Tommasi et al. 2017b). New measurement techniques, such as Argo 
and deep Argo ﬂoats, may help to further develop prediction systems 
for subsurface MHWs, but such systems are not yet in place.
SST forecasts ranging from seasonal to decadal (5–10 years) have 
also been used or are planned to be used as early warning systems 
for multiple other ecosystems and ﬁsheries in addition to coral 
reefs, including aquaculture, lobster, sardine, and tuna ﬁsheries 
(Hobday  et  al. 2016b; Payne et  al. 2017; Tommasi et  al. 2017b). 
For example, seasonal forecasts of SST around Tasmania may help 
farm managers of salmon aquaculture to prepare and respond to 
upcoming MHWs by changing stocking densities, varying feed mixes, 
transferring ﬁsh to different locations in the farming region and 
implementing disease management (Spillman and Hobday, 2014; 
Hobday et al. 2016b). Skilful multi-annual to decadal SST predictions 
may also inform and improve decisions about spatial and industrial 
planning, as well as the management of various extractive sectors 
such as the adjustments to quotas for internationally shared ﬁsh 
stocks (Tommasi et al. 2017a). It has been shown that global climate 
forecasts have signiﬁcant skill in predicting the occurrence of above 
average warm or cold SST events at decadal timescales in coastal 
areas (Tommasi et al. 2017a), but barriers to their widespread usage 
in ﬁshery and aquaculture industry still exist (Tommasi et al. 2017b). 
Even with a monitoring and prediction system in place, MHWs 
have developed without warning and had catastrophic effects 
(Payne et al. 2017). For example, governmental agencies, socioeconomic 
sectors, public health ofﬁcials and citizens were not forewarned of the 
Coastal Peruvian 2017 MHW, despite a basin-wide monitoring system 
across the Paciﬁc. The reason was partly due to a coastal El  Niño 
deﬁnition problem and a new government (in Nicaragua) that may have 
hindered actions (Ramírez and Briones, 2017). Therefore, early warning 
systems should not only provide predictions of physical changes, but 
should also connect different institutions to assist decision makers in 
performing time-adaptive measures (Chang et al. 2013). 
Monitoring and prediction systems are important and can be 
advanced by the use of common metrics to describe MHWs. So far, 
MHWs are often deﬁned differently in the literature, and it is only 
recently that a categorising scheme (Categories I to IV; based on the 
degree to which temperatures exceed the local climatology), similar to 
what is used for hurricanes, has been developed (Hobday et al. 2018). 
Such a categorising scheme, can easily be applied to real data and 
predictions, and may facilitate comparison, public communication 
and familiarity with MHWs. Similar metrics (e.g., DHW) have been 
successfully developed and used to identify ocean regions where 
conditions conducive to coral bleaching are developing.

Extreme ENSO Events and Other Modes 
of Interannual Climate Variability
6.5.1 
Key Processes and Feedbacks, Observations, 
Detection and Attribution, Projections
6.5.1.1 
Extreme El Niño, La Niña
AR5 (Christensen et al. 2013) and SREX do not provide a deﬁnition for 
an extreme El Niño but mention such events, especially in the context 
of the 1997–1998 El Niño and its impacts. AR5 and SREX concluded 
that conﬁdence in any speciﬁc change in ENSO variability in the 
21st century is low. However, they did note that due to increased 
moisture availability, precipitation variability associated with ENSO is 
likely to intensify. Since AR5 and SREX, there is now a limited body of 
literature that examines the impact of climate change on ENSO over 
the historical period.
Palaeo-ENSO studies suggest that ENSO was highly variable throughout 
the Holocene, with no evidence for a systematic trend in ENSO variance 
(Cobb et al. 2013) but with some indication that the ENSO variance 
over 1979–2009 has been much larger than that over 1590–1880 
(McGregor et al. 2013). Palaeo-ENSO reconstruction for the past eight 
centuries suggests that central Paciﬁc ENSO activity has increased 
between the last two decades (1980–2015; Liu et  al. 2017b), with 
an increasing number of central Paciﬁc El Niño events compared to 
east Paciﬁc El Niño events (Freund et al. 2019). Further proxy evidence 
exists for changes in the mean state of the equatorial Paciﬁc in the last 
2000 years (Rustic et al. 2015; Henke et al. 2017). Simulations using 
an Earth System Model indicate signiﬁcantly higher ENSO variance 
during 1645–1715 than during the 21st century warm period, though 
it is unclear whether these simulated changes are realistic (Keller et al. 
2015). For the 20th century, the frequency and intensity of El Niño events 
were high during 1951–2000, in comparison with the 1901–1950 
period (Lee and McPhaden, 2010; Kim et al. 2014b; Roxy et al. 2014). 
Current instrumental observational records are not long enough and 
the quality of data before 1950 is limited, to assert these changes with 
high conﬁdence (Wittenberg, 2009; Stevenson et al. 2010) though the 
palaeo records mentioned here signal the emergence of a statistically 
signiﬁcant increase in ENSO variance in recent decades.
Since SREX and AR5, an extreme El Niño event occurred in 2015–2016. 
This has resulted in signiﬁcant new literature regarding physical 
processes and impacts but there are no ﬁrm conclusions regarding 
the impact of climate change on the event. The SST anomaly peaked 
toward the central equatorial Paciﬁc causing ﬂoods in many regions of 
the world such as those in the west coasts of the USA and other parts 
of North America, some parts of South America close to Argentina 
and Uruguay, the UK and China (Ward et al. 2014; Ward et al. 2016; 
Zhai et al. 2016; Scaife et al. 2017; Whan and Zwiers, 2017; Sun and 
Miao, 2018; Yuan et al. 2018). 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks 
Chapter 6

The main new body of literature concerns future projections of the 
frequency of occurrence and variability of extreme ENSO events 
with improved conﬁdence (Cai et al. 2014a; Cai et al. 2018). These 
studies deﬁne extreme El Niño events as those El Niño events which 
are characterised by a pronounced eastward extension of the west 
Paciﬁc warm pool and development of atmospheric convection, 
and hence a rainfall increase of greater than 5 mm day–1 during 
December to February (above 90th percentile), in the usually cold 
and dry equatorial eastern Paciﬁc (Niño 3 region, 150ºW–90ºW, 
5ºS–5ºN; Cai et al. 2014a), such as the 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 
2015–2016 El Niños (Santoso et al. 2017; Figure 6.5).
The background long-term warming puts the 2015–2016 El Niño 
among the three warmest in the instrumental records (24 El Niño 
events occurred during 1900–2018; Huang et  al. 2016; Santoso 
et  al.  2017). The 2015–2016 event can be viewed as the ﬁrst 
emergence of an extreme El Niño in the 21st century – one which 
satisﬁes the rainfall threshold deﬁnition, but not characterised by the 
eastward extension of the west Paciﬁc warm pool (L’Heureux et al. 
2017; Santoso et al. 2017).
Based on the precipitation threshold, extreme El Niño frequency is 
projected to increase with the global mean temperatures (medium 
conﬁdence) with a doubling in the 21st century under 1.5ºC of global 
warming, from about one event every 20 years during 1891–1990, 
to one every 10 years (Cai et  al. 2014a; Figure 6.5). The increase 
in frequency continues for up to a century even after global mean 
temperature has stabilised at 1.5ºC, thereby challenging the limits to 
adaptation, and hence indicates high risk even at the 1.5ºC threshold 
(Wang et  al. 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 2018). Meanwhile, the 
La Niña events also tend to increase in frequency and double under 
RCP8.5 (Cai et al. 2015), but indicate no further signiﬁcant changes 
after global mean temperatures have stabilised (Wang et al. 2017). 
Particularly concerning is that swings from extreme El Niño to 
extreme La Niña (opposite of extreme El Niño) have been projected 
to occur more frequently under greenhouse warming (Cai et al. 2015). 
The increasing ratio of Central Paciﬁc El Niño events to East Paciﬁc 
El Niño events is projected to continue, under increasing emissions 
(Freund et al. 2019). Further, CMIP5 models indicate that the risk of 
major rainfall disruptions has already increased for countries where 
the rainfall variability is linked to ENSO variability. This risk will remain 
elevated for the entire 21st century, even if substantial reductions in 
global GHG emissions are made (medium conﬁdence). The increase 
in disruption risk is caused by anthropogenic warming that drives an 
increase in the frequency and magnitude of ENSO events and also 
by changes in background SST patterns (Power et al. 2013; Chung 
et al. 2014; Huang and Xie, 2015). While many of these studies have 
adopted the precipitation view of an extreme El Nino, studies also 
indicate an increase in SST variability for events with their main SST 
anomalies in the east Paciﬁc (Cai et al. 2018). Also, a role of cross-
equatorial winds has been identiﬁed (Hu and Fedorov, 2018).
6.5.1.2 
Indian Ocean Basin-wide Warming and Changes 
in Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) Events
The Indian Ocean has experienced consistent warming from the 
surface to 2,000 m during 1960–2015, with most of the warming 
occurring in the upper 300 m (Cheng et al. 2015; Nieves et al. 2015; 
Cheng et al. 2017; Gnanaseelan et al. 2017). New historical ocean 
heat content (OHC) estimates show an abrupt increase in the Indian 
Ocean upper 700 m OHC after 1998, contributing to more than 21% 
of the global ocean heat gain, despite representing only about 12%

of the global ocean area (Cheng et al. 2017; Makarim et al. 2019). The 
tropical Indian Ocean SST has warmed by 1.04ºC during 1950–2015, 
while the tropical SST warming is 0.83ºC and the global SST warning 
is 0.65ºC. More than 90% of the surface warming in the Indian 
Ocean has been attributed to changes in GHG emissions (Dong 
et al. 2014), with the heat redistributed in the basin via local ocean 
and atmospheric dynamics (Liu et al. 2015b), the ITF (Section 6.6.1; 
Susanto et al. 2012; Sprintall and Revelard, 2014; Lee et al. 2015b; 
Susanto and Song, 2015; Zhang et al. 2018) and the Walker circulation 
(Roxy et al. 2014; Abish et al. 2018). 
The dynamic processes related to the projected changes in IOD under 
global warming have a large inter-model spread (Cai et al. 2013). The 
frequency of extreme positive IOD events are projected to increase 
by almost a factor of three, from a one-in-seventeen-year event in 
the 20th century to a one-in-six-year event in the 21st century (low 
conﬁdence). The bias in the CMIP5 models and internal variability 
could enlarge the projected increase in the extreme positive IOD 
events (Li et al. 2016a; Hui and Zheng, 2018). The increase in IOD 
events is not linked to the change in the frequency of El Niño 
events but instead to mean state change—with weakening of 
both equatorial westerly winds and eastward oceanic currents in 
association with a faster warming in the western than the eastern 
equatorial Indian Ocean (Cai et al. 2014b). A combination of extreme 
ENSO and IOD events has led to a northward shift in the Intertropical 
Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during 1979–2015, which is expected to 
increase further in the future (Freitas et al. 2017).
6.5.2 
Impacts on Human and Natural Systems
Increasing frequency of extreme ENSO and IOD events have the 
potential to have widespread impacts on natural and human systems 
in many parts of the globe. Though the occurrence of the extreme 
2015–2016 El Niño has produced a large body of literature, it is still not 
clear how climate change may have altered such an impact, nor how 
such impacts might change in the future with increasing frequency 
of extreme ENSO events. We highlight here some studies that have 
attempted to assess the joint impact of mean change and variability. 
In addition to observed high variability of rainfall, severe weather 
events and impacts on TCs activity (Yonekura and Hall, 2014; Zhang 
and Guan, 2014; Wang and Liu, 2016; Zhan, 2017), extreme El Nino 
events have substantial impacts on natural systems which include 
those on marine ecosystems (Sanseverino et  al. 2016; Mogollon 
and Calil, 2017; Ohman et al. 2017), such as severe and repeated 
bleaching of corals (Hughes et al. 2017a; Hughes et al. 2017b; Eakin 
et al. 2018), and glacial growth and retreat (Thompson et al. 2017). 
On the other hand, impacts on human, including managed systems 
are: increased incidences of forest ﬁres (Christidis et al. 2018b; Tett 
et al. 2018), degraded air quality (Koplitz et al. 2015; Chang et al. 
2016; Zhai et al. 2016) such as the dense haze over most parts of 
Indonesia and the neighboring countries in Southeast Asia as a result 
of prolonged Indonesian wildﬁres, thus imposing adverse impacts on 
public health in the affected areas (Koplitz et al. 2015; WMO, 2016), 
decreased agricultural yields in many parts of the globe (e.g., in most 
of the Paciﬁc Islands countries, Thailand, eastern and southern Africa 
and others which resulted food insecurity, particularly in eastern and 
southern Africa (UNSCAP, 2015; WMO, 2016; Christidis et al. 2018b; 
Funk et al. 2018), and regional uptick in the number of reported cases 
of plague and hantavirus in Colorado and New Mexico, cholera in 
Tanzania, dengue in Brazil and Southeast Asia (Anyamba et al. 2019) 
and Zika virus in South America (Caminade et al. 2017), including 
increases in heat stroke cases (Christidis et al. 2018b). Substantial 
economic losses had resulted from droughts and ﬂoods across 
various parts of the globe due to teleconnections. For instance, direct 
losses of 10 billion USD (Sun and Miao, 2018; Yuan et al. 2018) and 
6.5 billion USD (Christidis et al. 2018b) were estimated to have been 
incurred from severe urban inundation in cities along the Yangtze 
River in China and the extreme drought in Thailand, respectively. 
ENSO events affect TCs activity through variations in the low-level wind 
anomalies, vertical wind shear, mid-level relative humidity, steering 
ﬂow, the monsoon trough and the western Paciﬁc subtropical high in 
Asia (Yonekura and Hall, 2014; Zhang and Guan, 2014). The subsurface 
heat discharge due to El Niño can intensify TCs in the eastern Paciﬁc 
(Jin et al. 2014; Moon et al. 2015b). TCs are projected to become more 
frequent (~20–40%) during future-climate El Niño events compared 
with present climate El Niño events (medium conﬁdence), and less 
frequent during future-climate La Niña events, around a group of 
small island nations (for example, Fiji, Vanuatu, Marshall Islands and 
Hawaii) in the Paciﬁc (Chand et al. 2017). The Indian Ocean basin-wide 
warming has led to an increase in TC heat potential in the Indian Ocean 
over the last 30 years, however the link to the changes in the frequency 
of TCs is not robust (Rajeevan et al. 2013).
During the early stages of an extreme El Niño event (2015–2016 
El Niño), there is an initial decrease in atmospheric CO2 concentrations 
over the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean, due to suppression of equatorial 
upwelling, reducing the supply of CO2 to the surface (Chatterjee et al. 
2017), followed by a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations due 
reduced terrestrial CO2 uptake and increased ﬁre emissions (Bastos 
et al. 2018). It is not clear how a future increase in the frequency 
extreme events would modulate the carbon cycle on longer decadal 
time scales.
Studies on projections of changes in ENSO impacts or teleconnections 
are rather limited. Nevertheless, Power and Delage (2018) provide 
a  multi-model assessment of CMIP5 models and their simulated 
changes in the precipitation response to El Niño in the future 
(Figure  6.6). They identify different combinations of changes that 
might further impact natural and human systems. El Niño causes 
either positive or negative precipitation anomalies in diverse 
regions of the globe. Dry El Niño teleconnection anomalies may be 
further strengthened by, either mean climate drying in the region 
(Amazon, Central America and Australia in June to August (JJA)), or 
a strengthening of the El Niño dry teleconnection, or both. Conversely, 
wet El Niño teleconnections can be further strengthened by either 
increases in mean precipitation (East Africa and southeastern South 
America in December to February (DJF)) or a strengthening of the 
El  Niño wet teleconnection (southeastern South America in JJA), 
or both (Tibetan Plateau, DJF). However, a present day dry El Niño 
response may be dampened by a wet mean response (South, East 
and Southeast Asia in JJA) or a wet present day El Niño response may 
be weakened by a dry mean change (Southern Europe/Mediterranean 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks 
Chapter 6

615
and West Coast South America in JJA). Finally, changes in the mean 
and El Niño response may be in the opposite direction (Southeast 
Asia, JJA and Central North America, DJF). Such changes could have 
an impact on phenomena such as wildﬁres (Fasullo et  al. 2018). 
However, in many other regions that are currently impacted by El Niño, 
e.g.,  regions of South America, studies have found no signiﬁcant 
changes in the ENSO-precipitation relationship (Tedeschi and Collins, 
2017) and agreement between models for many regions suggests low 
conﬁdence in projections of teleconnection changes (Yeh et al. 2018).
Along with extreme El Niño events, abrupt warming in the Indian 
Ocean and extreme IOD events have largely altered the Asian 
and African monsoon, impacting the food and water security over 
these regions. As a response to rising global SSTs and partially 
due to extreme El Niño events, the NH summer monsoon showed 
substantial intensiﬁcation during 1979–2011, with an increase in 
rainfall by 9.5% per degree Celsius of global warming (Wang et al. 
2013). However, the Indian summer monsoon circulation and rainfall 
exhibits a statistically signiﬁcant weakening since the 1950s. This 
weakening has been hypothesised to be a response to the Indian 
Ocean basin-wide warming (Mishra et al. 2012; Roxy et al. 2015) 
and also to increased aerosol emissions (Guo et  al. 2016) and 
changes in land use (Paul et al. 2016). Warming in the north Indian 
Ocean has resulted in increasing ﬂuctuations in the southwest 
monsoon winds and a three-fold increase in extreme rainfall events 
across central India (Roxy et al. 2017). The frequency and duration 
of heatwaves have increased over the Indian subcontinent, and 
these events are associated with the Indian Ocean basin-wide 
warming and frequent El Niños (Rohini et al. 2016). In April 2016, 
as a response to the extreme El Niño, Southeast Asia experienced 
surface air temperatures that surpassed national records, increased 
energy consumption, disrupted agriculture and resulted in severe 
human discomfort (Thirumalai et al. 2017). A strong negative IOD 
event in 2016 led to large climate impact on East African rainfall, 
with some regions recording below 50% of normal rainfall, leading 
to devastating drought, food insecurity and unsafe drinking water for 
over 15 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya.
6.5.3 
Risk Management and Adaptation
Risk management of ENSO events has focussed on two main aspects: 
better prediction and early warning systems, and better mechanisms for 
reducing risks to agriculture, infrastructure, ﬁsheries and aquaculture, 
wildﬁre and ﬂood management. Extreme ENSO events are rare, with 
three such events since 1950 and they are difﬁcult to predict due to the 
different drivers inﬂuencing them (Puy et al. 2017). The impacts of ENSO 
events also vary between events and between the different regions 
affected (Murphy et al. 2014; Fasullo et al. 2018; Power and Delage, 
2018) however, there is limited literature on the change in the impacts 
of extreme ENSO compared to other ENSO events. In addition, there are 
also no speciﬁc risk management and adaptation strategies for human 
and natural systems for more extreme events other than what is in 
place for ENSO events (see also Chapter 4, Section 4.4 for the response 
to sea level change, an observed impact of ENSO). A ﬁrst step in risk 
management and adaptation is thus to better understand the impacts 
these events have and to identify conditions that herald such extreme 
events that could be used to better predict extreme ENSO events. 
Monitoring and forecasting are the most developed ways to manage 
extreme ENSOs. Several systems are already in place for monitoring 
and predicting seasonal climate variability and ENSO occurrence. 
However, the sustainability of the observing system is challenging 
and currently the Tropical Paciﬁc Observing System 2020 (TPOS 2020) 
has the task of redesigning such a system, with ENSO prediction as 
one of its main objectives. These systems could be further elaborated 
to include extreme ENSO events. Westerly wind events in the Western 
Tropical Paciﬁc, (Lengaigne et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2015a; Fedorov 
et al. 2015) strong easterly wind events in the tropical Paciﬁc (Hu and 
Fedorov, 2016; Puy et al. 2017), nonlinear interaction between air-
sea ﬂuxes and atmospheric deep convection (Bellenger et al. 2014; 
Takahashi and Dewitte, 2016) and advection of mean temperature 
by anomalous eastward zonal currents (Kim and Cai, 2014) are 
some of the factors that play an important role in the evolution of 
extreme ENSO events, which can be considered while improving the 
monitoring and forecasting system.

Despite the speciﬁcity of each extreme El Niño event, their forecasting 
is expected to improve through monitoring of recently identiﬁed 
precursory signals that peak in a window of two years before the 
event (Varotsos et  al. 2016). An early warning system for coral 
bleaching associated, among other stressors, with extreme ENSO 
heat stress is provided by the NOAA Coral Reef Watch service with 
a 5 km resolution (Liu et al. 2018). The impacts of ENSO-associated 
extreme heat stress are heterogeneous, indicating the inﬂuence 
of other factors either biotic such as coral species composition, 
local adaptation by coral taxa reef depth or abiotic such as local 
upwelling or thermal anomalies (Claar et al. 2018). When identiﬁed 
and quantiﬁed, these factors can be used for risk analysis and risk 
management for these ecosystems.
In principle, it is easier to transfer the ﬁnancial risk associated with 
extreme ENSO events through, for example, insurance products or 
other risk transfer instruments such as Catastrophe Bonds, than 
for more moderate events. An accurate prediction system is not 
required, but the measurement of these events, and quantiﬁcation 
of likely impacts is required. As in other types of insurance 
systems, this can be done through, for example, calculations of 
average annual losses associated with extreme ENSO, and the 
design of appropriate ﬁnancial instruments. Examples of research 
that can support the design of risk transfer instruments include 
Anderson et al. (2018) and Gelcer et al. (2018) for speciﬁc crops 
yields, and Aguilera et al. (2018) and Broad et al. (2002) for speciﬁc 
ﬁsheries. Several risk transfer instruments have been implemented 
to deal with ENSO impacts, including parametric insurance 
based on SSTs for heavy rainfall damages, and another scheme 
for agricultural damages, both in Peru. Other examples include 
forecast-based ﬁnancial aid (Red Cross Climate Centre, 2016). 
More broadly, other forms of risk management and governance can 
be designed with better information about the likely impacts of 
extreme ENSO events (e.g., Vignola et al. 2018).
6.6 
Inter-Ocean Exchanges 
and Global Change
Section 3.6.5.1 in AR5 brieﬂy described the Indonesian 
Throughﬂow  (ITF) but did not explain its variability and impacts. 
Palaeoclimate record, observations, and climate model studies 
suggest that ITF plays an integral role in global ocean circulation, 
directly impacting mass, heat and freshwater budgets of the Paciﬁc 
and Indian Oceans (high conﬁdence). ITF is inﬂuenced by equatorial 
Paciﬁc trade wind system which experienced an unprecedented 
intensiﬁcation during 2001–2014, resulting in enhanced ocean 
heat transport from the Paciﬁc to the Indian Ocean and inﬂuencing 
the rate of global temperature change (medium conﬁdence). Yet, 
numerical models are not able to simulate the magnitude of decadal 
variability and the inter-ocean link, which means there is low 
conﬁdence in future projections of the trade wind system.
6.6.1 
Key Processes and Feedbacks, Observations, 
Detection and Attribution, Projections
In the last two decades, total water transport from the Paciﬁc to 
the Indian Ocean and the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean has 
increased (high conﬁdence). Increased ITF has been attributed to 
Paciﬁc cooling and basin-wide warming in the Indian Ocean. The ITF 
annual average is 15 x 106 m3 s–1 (Susanto et al. 2012). ITF varies 
from intraseasonal to decadal time scales. On seasonal time scale, 
South China Sea Throughﬂow controls freshwater ﬂux and modulates 
the main ITF (Fang et al. 2010; Susanto et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2019; 
Wang et al. 2019; Wei et al. 2019). During the extreme El Niño of 
1997–1998, the ITF transport was reduced to 9.2 x 106  m3 s–1. 
Based on observations and proxy records from satellite altimetry 
and gravimetry, in the last two decades, 1992–2012, ITF has been 
stronger (Sprintall and Revelard, 2014; Liu et al. 2015a; Susanto and 
Song, 2015), which translates to an increase in ocean heat-ﬂux into 
the Indian Ocean (Lee et al. 2015b). Exchanges of heat and fresh 
water between ocean basins are important at the global scale 
(Flato et al. 2013). ITF may have played a key role in the slowdown of 
the Paciﬁc SST warming during 1998–2013, and the rapid warming 
in the surface and subsurface Indian Ocean during this period 
(Section 6.5.1.2; Makarim et al. 2019), by transferring warm water 
from the western Paciﬁc into the Indian Ocean (Lee et al. 2015b; 
Dong and McPhaden, 2018). 
Under 1.5ºC warming both El Niño and La Niña frequencies may 
increase (see Section 6.5) and hence ITF variability may also increase. 
ITF is also inﬂuenced by the IOD events, with an increase in transport 
during a positive IOD and vice-versa during a negative IOD event 
(Potemra and Schneider, 2007; Pujiana et  al. 2019). Positive IODs 
are projected to increase threefold in the 21st century as a response 
to changes in the mean state rather than changes in the El Niño 
frequency (Section 6.5.1.2; Cai et  al. 2014b) and this may have 
an impact on the ITF, additional to the changes due to increasing 
extreme ENSO events. In response to greenhouse warming, climate 
models predict that on interannual time scale, it is likely that the mean 
ITF may decrease due to wind variability (Sen Gupta et al. 2016), 
but recent observation trend tends to strengthen which has led to 
speculations about the ﬁdelity of the current climate models (Chung 
et al. 2019). On multidecadal and centennial timescales, it is likely 
that mean ITF decreases which is not associated with wind variability 
but due to reduction of net deep ocean upwelling in the tropical 
South Paciﬁc (Sen Gupta et al. 2016; Feng et al. 2017; Feng et al. 
2018). Due to a lack of long-term sustained ITF observations, their 
impacts on Indo-Paciﬁc climate varibility, biogeochemisty, ecosystem 
as well as society are not fully understood.
Paciﬁc SST cooling trends and strengthened the equatorial Paciﬁc 
trade winds have been linked to anomalously warm tropical Indian 
and Atlantic oceans. The period following the mid-1990s saw 
a marked strengthening of both the easterly trade winds in the central 
equatorial Paciﬁc (Figure 6.7) and the Walker circulation (L’Heureux 
et al. 2013; England et al. 2014). Both the magnitude and duration of 
this trend are large when compared with past variability reconstructed 
using atmosphere reanalyses. (The 1886–1905 extreme weakening 
trend is poorly constrained by observations and we note the disparity 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks

between reanalysis products going back in time.) Moreover, it is very 
unusual when model simulations are used as an estimate of internal 
climate variability (Figure 6.7; England et al. 2014; Kociuba and Power, 
2015). The slowdown in global surface warming is dominated by the 
cooling in the Paciﬁc SSTs, which is associated with a strengthening 
of the Paciﬁc trade winds (Kosaka and Xie, 2013). This pattern leads 
to cooling over land and possibly to additional heat uptake by the 
ocean, although recent studies suggest that ocean heat uptake 
may even slow down during surface warming slowdown periods 
(Xie et al. 2016; von Känel et al. 2017). The intensiﬁcation of the 
Paciﬁc trade winds has been related to inter-ocean basin SST trends, 
with rapid warming in the Indian (see section 6.5.1.2) and Atlantic 
Oceans both hypothesised as drivers (Kucharski et al. 2011; Luo et al. 
2012; McGregor et al. 2014; Zhang and Karnauskas, 2017). While the 
extreme event of strengthening trade winds are potentially a result 
of natural internal variability, a role of anthropogenic contribution 
has not been ruled out. Nevertheless, the CMIP5 models indicate no 
general change in trends into the future (Figure 6.7), giving more 
weight to natural internal variability as an explanation. 
Among the number of potential causes of this decadal variability in 
surface global temperature, a prolonged negative phase of the Paciﬁc 
Decadal Oscillation/Interdecadal Paciﬁc Oscillation (PDO/IPO) was 
suggested as a contributor. Because of the magnitude and duration of 
this Paciﬁc-centred variability (Figure 6.7), it is identiﬁed as an extreme 
decadal climate event. One line of research has explored the role of 
the warm tropical Atlantic decadal variability in forcing the trade wind 
trends and associated cooling Paciﬁc SST trends (Kucharski et al. 2011; 
McGregor et al. 2014; Li et al. 2016b). It appears that climate models may 
misrepresent this link due to tropical Atlantic biases (Kajtar et al. 2018; 
McGregor et al. 2018) and thus potentially underestimate global mean 
temperature decadal variability. Nevertheless, there is no indication 
that such an underestimation of global temperature variability is 
evident in the models (Flato et al. 2013; Marotzke and Forster, 2015). 
The impact of modes of natural variability on global mean temperature 
decadal variability remains an active area of research.
In the Indian Ocean, water exits the Indonesian Seas mostly 
ﬂowing westward along with the South Equatorial Current, and 
some supplying the Leeuwin Current. The South Equatorial Current 
feeds the heat and biogeochemical signatures from the Indian 
Ocean into the Agulhas Current, which transports it further into the 
Atlantic Ocean. Observations of Mozambique Channel inﬂow from 
2003–2012 measured a mean transport of 16.7 x 106 m3 s–1 with 
a maximum in austral winter, and IOD related interannual variability 
of 8.9 x 106 m3 s–1 (Ridderinkhof et al. 2010). A multidecadal proxy, 
from three years of mooring data and satellite altimetry, suggests 
that the Agulhas Current has been broadening since the early 1990s 
due to an increase in eddy kinetic energy (Beal and Elipot, 2016). 
Numerical model experiments suggest an intensiﬁcation of the 
Agulhas leakage since the 1960s, which has contributed to the 
warming in the upper 300 m of the tropical Atlantic Ocean (Lübbecke 
et al. 2015). Agulhas leakage is found to covary with the AMOC on 
decadal and multi-decadal timescales and has likely contributed 
to the AMOC slowdown (Biastoch et  al. 2015; Kelly et  al. 2016). 
Meanwhile, climate projections indicate that Agulhas leakage is likely 
to strengthen and may partially compensate the AMOC slowdown 
projected by coarse-resolution climate models (Loveday et al. 2015).
6.6.2 
Impacts on Natural and Human Systems
Interannual to decadal variability of Indo-Paciﬁc SST variability is likely 
to affect extreme hydroclimate in East Africa (Ummenhofer et al. 2018). 
The Paciﬁc cooling pattern is often synonymous with predominance 
of La Niña events in 1998 and 2012 is linked to megadroughts in 
the USA (Baek et al. 2019). On decadal to multidecadal time scales, 
PDO/IPO and Atlantic variability may have impacts on megadroughts 
in North America (Coats et al. 2016; Diodato et al. 2019) and Australia 
(Vance et al. 2015) as well as Indian subcontinent (Bao et al. 2015; 
Joshi  and Rai, 2015). It is likely that occurrence of megadroughts 
in North America and Australia increased (Kiem et  al. 2016; 
Baek et al. 2019). PDO and North Paciﬁc Gyre Oscillation may also

The Paciﬁc cooling pattern may have signiﬁcant impacts on 
terrestrial carbon uptake via teleconnections. The reduced ecosystem 
respiration due to the smaller warming over land has signiﬁcantly 
accelerated the net biome productivity and therefore increased 
the terrestrial carbon sink (Ballantyne et al. 2017) and paused the 
growth rate of atmospheric CO2 despite increasing anthropogenic 
carbon emissions (Keenan et al. 2016). During the 2000s, the global 
ocean carbon sink has also strengthened (Fay and McKinley, 2013; 
Landschützer et al. 2014; Majkut et al. 2014; Landschützer et al. 2015; 
Munro et al. 2015), reversing a trend of stagnant or declining carbon 
uptake during the 1990s. It has been suggested that the upper ocean 
overturning circulation has weakened during the 2000s thereby 
decreasing the outgassing of natural CO2, especially in the Southern 
Ocean (Landschützer et al. 2015), and enhanced the global ocean 
CO2 sink (DeVries et al. 2017). How this is connected to the global 
warming slowdown is currently unclear.

Observational and Model Understanding of Atlantic 
Ocean Circulation Changes
Palaeo-reconstructions indicate that the North Atlantic is a region 
where rapid climatic variations can occur (IPCC, 2013). Deep 
waters formed in the northern North Atlantic induces a large-scale 
AMOC which transports large amounts of heat northward across 
the hemispheres, explaining part of the difference in temperature 
between the two hemispheres, as well as the northward location of 
the ITCZ (e.g., Buckley and Marshall, 2016). This circulation system 
is believed to be a key tipping point of the Earth’s climate system 
(IPCC, 2013).
Considerable effort has been dedicated in the last decades to 
improve the observation system of the large-scale ocean circulation 
(e.g., Argo and its array of about 3,800 free-drifting proﬁling ﬂoats), 
including the AMOC through dedicated large-scale observing arrays 
(at 16ºN (Send et al. 2011) and 26ºN (McCarthy et al. 2015b), in 
the subpolar gyre (SPG) (Lozier et al. 2017), between Portugal and 
the tip of Greenland (Mercier et al. 2015), at 34.5ºS (Meinen et al. 
2013), among others). The strength of the AMOC at 26ºN has been 
continuously estimated since 2004 with an annual mean estimate 
of 17 ± 1.9 x 106 m3 s–1 over the 2004–2017 period (Smeed 
et al. 2018). The AMOC at 26ºN has been 2.7 x 106 m3 s–1 weaker 
in 2008–2017 than in the ﬁrst four years of measurement (Smeed 
et al. 2018). However, the record is not yet long enough to determine 
if there is a long-term decline of the AMOC. McCarthy et al. (2012) 
reported a 30% reduction in the AMOC in 2009–2010, followed by 
a weaker minimum a year later. Analysis of forced ocean models 
suggests such events may occur once every two or three decades 
(Blaker  et  al.  2015). At 34.5ºS, the mean AMOC is estimated as 
14.7 ± 8.3 x 106 m3 s–1 over the period 2009–2017 (Meinen et al. 
2018) also with large interannual variability, while no trend has been 
identiﬁed at this latitude. Estimates based on ocean reanalyses show 
considerable diversity in their AMOC mean state, and its evolution 
over the last 50 years (Karspeck et al. 2017; Menary and Hermanson, 
2018), because only very few deep ocean observations before the 
Argo era, starting around 2004, are available. During the Argo era, 
the reanalyses agree better with each other (Jackson et al. 2016).
During the last interglacial warm period, palaeo-data suggest that the 
AMOC may have been weaker (Govin et al. 2012) and also show proxy 
record evidences of instabilities (Galaasen et al. 2014). Based on an 
AMOC reconstruction using SST ﬁngerprints, it has been suggested 
that the AMOC may have experienced around 3 ± 1 x 106 m3 s–1 
of weakening (about 15% decrease) since the mid-20th century 
(Caesar et al. 2018). Such a trend in AMOC was also suspected in 
a former study using Principal Component Analysis of SST (Dima and 
Lohmann, 2010). Palaeo-proxies also highlight that the historical era 
may exhibit an unprecedented low AMOC over the last 1,600 years 
(Sherwood et  al. 2011; Rahmstorf et  al. 2015; Thibodeau et  al. 
2018; Thornalley et al. 2018). Nevertheless, these proxy records are 
indirect measurements of the AMOC so that considerable uncertainty 
remains concerning these results. Moreover, the exact mechanisms 
to explain such a long-term weakening are not fully understood 
and some reconstructions show a weakening starting very early 
in the historical era, when the level of anthropogenic perturbation 
and warming was very low. Climate model simulations (Figure 6.8) 
do show a weakening over the historical era, but this weakening 
is mainly occurring over the recent decades. Climate projections 
exhibit a weakening of around 1.4 ± 1.4 x 106 m3 s–1 for present 
day (2006–2015) minus pre-industrial (1850–1900), highlighting 
that anthropogenic warming may have already forced an AMOC 
weakening. Nevertheless, no proper detection and attribution of the 
on-going changes has been led so far due to still limited observational 
evidences. Thus, we conclude that there is medium conﬁdence that the 
AMOC has weakened over the historical era but there is insufﬁcient 
evidence to quantify a likely range of the magnitude of the change.
Examination of 14 models from the CMIP5 archive, which do not 
take into account the melting (either from runoff, basal melting or 
icebergs) from the GIS (cf. Section 6.7.1.2), led to the assessment that 
the AMOC is very unlikely to collapse in the 21st century in response 
to increasing GHG concentrations (IPCC, 2013). Nonetheless, the 
CMIP5 models agree that a weakening of the AMOC into the 21st 
century will lead to localised cooling (relative to the global mean) 
centred in the North Atlantic SPG (Menary and Wood, 2018), 
although the precise location as well as the extension of this cooling 
patch, notably towards Europe, remains uncertain (Sgubin et al. 2017; 
Menary and Wood, 2018).
Abrupt variations in SST or sea ice cover have been found in 19 out 
of the 40 models of the CMIP5 archive (Drijfhout et al. 2015). Large 
cooling trends, which can occur in a decade, are found in the subpolar 
North Atlantic in 9 out of 40 models. Results show that the heat 
transport in the AMOC plays a role in explaining such a rapid cooling, 
but other processes are also key for setting the rapid (decadal-scale)

timeframe of SPG cooling, notably vertical heat transport in the ocean 
and interactions with sea ice and the atmosphere (Sgubin et al. 2017). 
Using the representation of stratiﬁcation as an emergent constraint, 
rapid changes in subpolar convection and associated cooling are 
occurring in the 21st century in 5 of the 11 best models (Sgubin et al. 
2017). The poor representation of ocean deep convection in most 
CMIP5 models has been conﬁrmed in Heuze (2017), which can 
notably limit a key feedback mechanism related with warm summer 
in the North Atlantic and its impact on oceanic convection in winter 
(Oltmanns et al. 2018). Thus, there is low conﬁdence in the projections 
of SPG fate. Increasing the horizontal resolution of the ocean in next 
generation climate models might be a way to increase conﬁdence in 
ocean convection future changes.
The SPG dynamical system has been identiﬁed as a tipping element 
of the climate system (Mengel et al. 2012; Born et al. 2013). If this 
element reaches its tipping point, the SPG circulation can change 
very abruptly between different stable steady states, due to positive 
feedback between convective activity and salinity transport within 
the gyre (Born et  al. 2016). It has been argued that a transition 
between two SPG stable states can explain the onset of the Little 
Ice Age that may have occurred around the 14–15th century (Lehner 
et al. 2013; Schleussner et al. 2015; Moreno-Chamarro et al. 2017) 
possibly triggered by large volcanic eruption (Schleussner and 
Feulner, 2013). Furthermore a few CMIP5 climate models also 
showed a rapid cooling in the SPG within the 1970s cooling events, 
as a nonlinear response to aerosols (Bellucci et al. 2017). The SPG 
therefore appears as a tipping element in the climate system, with 
a faster (decade) response than the AMOC (century), but with lower 
induced SST cooling. Thus, the SPG system can cross a threshold in 
climate projections when surface water in the subpolar becomes 
lighter due to increase in temperature and decrease in salinity related 
with changes in radiative forcing (Sgubin et al. 2017).
Evaluation of AMOC variations in the CMIP5 database has been 
further analysed in this report (Figure 6.8) using almost twice as 
many models as in AR5 (IPCC, 2013). The AR5 assessment of a very 
unlikely AMOC collapse has been conﬁrmed, although one model 
(FGOALS-s2) does show such a collapse (e.g., decrease larger than 
80% relative to present day) before the end of the century for RCP8.5 
scenario (Figure 6.8). Now based on up to 27 model simulations, the 
decrease of the AMOC is assessed to be of -2.1 ± 2.6 x 106 m3 s–1 
(-11 ± 14%, likely range) in 2081–2100 relative to present day 
(2006–2015) for RCP2.6 scenario and  -5.5  ±  2.7 x 106 m3 s–1 
(-32 ±  14%) for RCP8.5 scenario, in line with a process-based 
probabilistic assessment (Schleussner et al. 2014). Furthermore, the 
uncertainty in AMOC changes has been shown to be mainly related 
to the spread in model responses rather than scenarios (RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5) or internal variability uncertainty (Reintges et  al. 2017). 
This behaviour is very different from the uncertainty in global SST

changes, which is mainly driven by emission scenario after a few 
decades (Frölicher et al. 2016). To explain the AMOC decline, a new 
mechanism has been proposed on top of the classical changes in 
heat and freshwater forcing (Gregory et al. 2016). A potential role 
for sea ice decrease has been highlighted (Sevellec et  al. 2017), 
due to large heat uptake increase in the Arctic leading to a strong 
warming of the North Atlantic, increasing the vertical stability of the 
upper ocean, as already observed in the Greenland and Iceland seas 
(Moore et al. 2015). It has also been showed that convection sites 
may move northward in future projections, following the sea ice edge 
(Lique and Thomas, 2018).
6.7.1.2 
Role of GIS Melting and their Freshwater 
Release Sources
Satellite data indicate accelerated mass loss from the GIS beginning 
around 1996, and freshwater contributions to the subpolar North 
Atlantic from Greenland, Canadian Arctic Archipelago glaciers and sea 
ice melt totalling around 60,000 m3 s–1 in 2013, a 50% increase since 
the mid-1990s (Yang et al. 2016b), in line with more recent estimates 
(Bamber et al. 2018). This increase in GIS melting is unprecedented 
over the last 350 years (Trusel et al. 2018). Since the mid-1990s, there 
has been about a 50% decrease in the thickness of the dense water 
mass formed in the Labrador Sea, suggesting a possible relationship 
between enhanced freshwater ﬂuxes and suppressed formation of 
North Atlantic Deep Water (Yang et al. 2016b). This hypothesis has 
been further supported by high-resolution ocean-only simulations 
showing that GIS melting may have affected the Labrador Sea 
convection since 2010, which may imply an emerging on-going 
impact of this melting on the SPG but a still non-detectable impact on 
the AMOC (Boning et al. 2016). Thus, while some studies argue that 
this melting may have affected the evolution of the AMOC over the 
20th century (Rahmstorf et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2016b), considerable 
variability and limitation in ocean models restrain the full validation 
of this hypothesis, which remains model dependent (Proshutinsky 
et  al. 2015; Dukhovskoy et  al. 2016). Furthermore, some deep 
convection events resumed since 2014 (Yashayaev and Loder, 2017). 
The impact of GIS melting is neglected in AR5 projections 
(Swingedouw et  al. 2013) but has been considered in a recent 
multi-model study (Bakker et al. 2016; Figure 6.9). The decrease of 
the AMOC in projections including this melting term is depicted in 
Figure 6.9. GIS melting estimates added in those simulations were 
based on the Lenaerts et  al. (2015) approach, using a regional 
atmosphere model to estimate GIS mass balance. Results from eight 
climate models and an extrapolation by an emulator calibrated on 
these models showed that GIS melting has an impact on the AMOC, 
potentially adding up to around 5–10% more AMOC weakening in

Figure 6.9 |  The changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) strength as a function of transient changes in global mean temperature for projections 
from RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario. This probabilistic assessment of annual mean AMOC strength changes (%) at 26ºN (below 500 m and relative to 1850–1900) as 
a function of global temperature change (degrees Celsius; relative to 1850–1900) results from 10,000 RCP4.5 and 10,000 RCP8.5 experiments over the period 2006–2300, 
which are derived from an AMOC emulator calibrated with simulations from eight climate models including the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) melting (Bakker et al. 2016). 
The annual mean AMOC strength changes are taken from transient simulations and are therefore not equilibrium values per se. Moreover, it should be stressed that the 
results stem from future runs, not past or historical runs. Thus, due to internal variability both in the global mean temperature and AMOC in this transient simulation, large 
weakening can be found even at 0ºC global warming. The ranges (66%, 90% and 99%) correspond to the amount of simulations that are within each envelope. The thick 
black line corresponds to the ensemble mean, while the different colours stand for different probability quantiles. The horizontal black thick line corresponds to the value 
of 80% of AMOC decrease, which can be seen as an almost total collapse of the AMOC. The horizontal black dashed thick line corresponds to a reduction of 50% of the 
AMOC, which can be considered as a substantial weakening. The vertical dashed green line stands for the 1.5ºC of global warming threshold (relative to 1850–1900). The 
violet cross stands for the observation-based reduction estimate from Caesar et al. (2018). The size of the cross represents the uncertainty in this estimate.

2100 under RCP8.5. Based on Figure 6.8 and 6.9, the risk of collapse 
before the end of the century is very unlikely, although biases in 
present-day climate models only provide medium conﬁdence in this 
assessment. By 2290–2300, Bakker et al. (2016; Figure 6.9) estimated 
at 44% the likelihood of an AMOC collapse in RCP8.5 scenario, while 
the AMOC weakening stabilises in RCP4.5 (37% reduction, (15–65%) 
very likely range). This result suggests that an AMOC collapse can be 
avoided in the long term by mitigation.
Concerning the question of the reversibility of the AMOC, a few 
ramp-up/ramp-down simulations have been performed to evaluate 
it for transient time scales (a few centuries, while millennia will be 
necessary for a full steady state). Results usually show a reversibility 
of the AMOC (Jackson et al. 2014; Sgubin et al. 2015) although the 
timing and amplitude is highly model dependent (Palter et al. 2018). 
A hysteresis behaviour of the AMOC in response to freshwater 
release has been found in a few climate models (Hawkins 
et al. 2011; Jackson et al. 2017) even at the eddy resolving resolution 
(Mecking et al. 2016; Jackson and Wood, 2018). This is in line with 
the possibility of tipping point in the AMOC system. The biases of 
present-day models in representing the transport at 30ºS (Deshayes 
et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2017a; Mecking et al. 2017) or the salinity 
in the tropical era (Liu et al. 2014b) may considerably affect the 
sensitivity of the models to freshwater release, but more on the 
multi-centennial time scale. 
Regarding the near-term changes of the AMOC, decadal prediction 
systems are now in place. They indicate a clear impact of the AMOC 
on the climate predictability horizon (Robson et al. 2012; Persechino 
et al. 2013; Robson et al. 2013; Wouters et al. 2013; Msadek et al. 
2014; Robson et al. 2018), and a possible weakening of the AMOC in 
the coming decade (Smith et al. 2013; Hermanson et al. 2014; Yeager 
et al. 2015; Robson et al. 2016), although not true in all decadal 
prediction systems (Yeager et al. 2018). All these prediction systems 
do not account for future melting of the GIS yet. 
6.7.2 
Impacts on Climate, Natural and Human Systems 
Even though the AMOC is very unlikely to collapse over the 
21st century, its weakening may be substantial, which may 
therefore induce strong and large-scale climatic impacts with 
potential far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems 
(e.g., Good et al. 2018). Furthermore, the SPG subsystem has been 
shown to potentially shift, in the future, into a cold state over 
a decadal time scale, with signiﬁcant climatic implications for the 
North Atlantic bordering regions (Sgubin et al. 2017). There have 
been far more studies analysing impacts on climate of an AMOC 
weakening than SPG collapse. We will thus in the following mainly 
depict impacts of an AMOC substantial weakening. 
The AR5 report concludes that based on palaeoclimate data, large 
changes in the Atlantic Ocean circulation can cause worldwide 
climatic impacts (Masson-Delmotte et  al. 2013), with notably, for 
an AMOC weakening, a cooling of the North Atlantic, a warming 
of the South Atlantic, less evaporation and therefore precipitation 
over the North Atlantic, and a shift of the ITCZ. Impacts of AMOC 
or SPG changes and their teleconnections in the atmosphere 
and ocean are supported by a large amount of palaeo-evidence 
(Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017). Such impacts and teleconnections have been 
further evaluated over the last few years both using new palaeo-
data and higher resolution models. Furthermore, multi-decadal 
variations in SST observed over the last century, the so-called 
Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) or Atlantic Multidecadal 
Oscillation (AMO), also provide observational evidence of potential 
impacts of changes in ocean circulation. Nevertheless, due to a lack 
of long-term direct measurements of the Atlantic Ocean circulation, 
the exact link between SST and circulation remains controversial 
(Clement et al. 2015; Zhang, 2017). 
The different potential impacts of large changes in the Atlantic 
Ocean circulation are summarised in Figure 6.10. Based on variability 
analysis, it has been shown that a decrease in the AMOC strength has 
impacts on storm track position and intensity in the North Atlantic 
(Gastineau et al. 2016), with a potential increase in the number of 
winter storms hitting Europe (Woollings et al. 2012; Jackson et al. 
2015), although some uncertainty remains with respect to the models 
considered (Peings et al. 2016). The inﬂuence on the Arctic sea ice 
cover has also been evidenced at the decadal scale, with a lower 
AMOC limiting the retreat of Arctic sea ice (Yeager et  al. 2015; 
Delworth and Zeng, 2016). The climatic impacts could be substantial 
over Europe (Jackson et al. 2015), where an AMOC weakening can 
lead to high pressure over the British Isles in summer (Haarsma et al. 
2015), reminiscent of a negative summer NAO, inducing an increase 
in precipitation in Northern Europe and a decrease in Southern 
Europe. In winter, the response of atmospheric circulation may 
help to reduce the cooling signature over Europe (Yamamoto and 
Palter, 2016), notably through an enhancement of warming maritime 
effect due to a stronger storm track (Jackson et al. 2015), driving 
more powerful storms in the North Atlantic (Hansen et al. 2016). The 
observed extreme low AMOC in 2009–2010, which was followed by 
a reduction in ocean heat content to the north (Cunningham et al. 
2013), has been possibly implicated in cold European weather events 
in winter 2009–2010 and December 2010 (Buchan et  al. 2014) 
although a robust attribution is missing. In summer, cold anomalies 
in the SPG, like the one occurring during the so-called cold blob in 
2015 (Josey et al. 2018), have been suspected to potentially enhance 
the probability of heatwaves over Europe in summer (Duchez et al. 
2016). Nevertheless, considerable uncertainties remain with regard 
to this aspect due to the lack of historical observations before 2004 
and due to poor model resolution of small-scale processes related 
to frontal dynamics around the Gulf Stream region (Vanniere et al. 
2017). In addition, oceanic changes in the Gulf Stream region may 
occur in line with AMOC weakening (Saba et al. 2016) with potential 
rapid warming due to a northward shift of the Gulf Stream. However, 
these changes are largely underestimated in coarse resolution 
models (Saba et al. 2016) . In North America, a negative phase of the 
AMV, reminiscent of a weakening of the AMOC, lowers agricultural 
production in a few Mexican coastal states (Azuz-Adeath et al. 2019).
Changes in ocean circulation can also strongly impact sea level 
in the regions bordering the North Atlantic (McCarthy et  al. 
2015a; Palter et al. 2018). A collapse of the AMOC or of the SPG 
could induce substantial increase of sea level up to a few tens

of centimetres along the western boundary of the North Atlantic 
(Ezer et al. 2013; Little et al. 2017; cf. Chapter 5). For instance, such 
a link may explain 30% of the extreme observed SLR event (a short-
lived increase of 12 mm during 2 years) in northeast America in 
2009–2010 (Ezer, 2015; Goddard et al. 2015). This illustrates that 
monitoring changes in AMOC may have practical implications for 
coastal protection.
The AMOC teleconnections are widespread and notably strongly 
affect the tropical area, as evidenced in palaeo-data for the Sahel 
region (Collins et  al. 2017; Mulitza et  al. 2017) and in model 
simulations (Jackson et al. 2015; Delworth and Zeng, 2016). These 
teleconnections may affect vulnerable populations. For instance, 
Defrance et  al. (2017) found that a substantial decrease in the 
AMOC, at the very upper end of potential changes, may strongly 
diminish precipitation in the Sahelian region, decreasing the millet 
and sorghum emblematic crop production, which may impact 
subsistence of tens of millions of people, increasing their potential 
for migration. Smaller amplitude variations in Sahelian rainfall, 
driven by North Atlantic SST, has been found to be predictable up 
to a decade ahead (Gaetani and Mohino, 2013; Mohino et al. 2016; 
Sheen et al. 2017), potentially providing mitigation and adaptation 
opportunities. The number of tropical storms in the North Atlantic 
has been found to be very sensitive to the AMOC (Delworth and 
Zeng, 2016; Yan et al. 2017) as well as to the SPG (Hermanson et al. 
2014) variations, so that a large weakening of the AMOC or cooling 
of the SPG may decrease the number of Atlantic tropical storms. 
The Asian monsoon may also potentially weaken in the case of 
large changes in the AMOC (Marzin et al. 2013; Jackson et al. 2015; 
Zhou et al. 2016; Monerie et al. 2019) implying substantial adverse 
impacts on populations. The interactions of the Atlantic basin with 
the Paciﬁc has also been largely discussed over the last few years, 
with the supposed inﬂuence of a cool North Atlantic inducing 
a warm tropical Paciﬁc (McGregor et al. 2014; Chaﬁk et al. 2016; 
Li  et  al. 2016b), although not found in all models (Swingedouw 
et  al. 2017), which may induce stronger amplitudes of El Niño 
(Dekker et al. 2018).
The AMOC plays an important function in transporting excess heat 
and anthropogenic carbon from the surface to the deep ocean 
(Kostov et al. 2014; Romanou et al. 2017), and therefore in setting 
the pace of global warming (Marshall et al. 2014). A large potential 
decline in the AMOC strength reduces global surface warming.

Figure 6.10 |  Infographic on teleconnections and impacts due to Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapse or substantial weakening. Changes in 
circulation have multiple impacts around the Atlantic Basin, but also include remote impacts in Asia and Antarctica. Reductions in AMOC lead to an excess of heat in the 
South Atlantic, leading to increased ﬂooding, methane emissions and drought, and a concomitant negative impact on food production and human systems. In the North 
Atlantic region hurricane frequency is decreased on the western side of the basin, but storminess increases in the east. Marine and terrestrial ecosystems, including food 
production, are impacted while sea level rise (SLR) is seen on both sides of the Atlantic. The arrows indicate the direction of the change associated with each icon and is 
put on its right. An assessment of the conﬁdence level in the understanding of the processes at play is indicated below each arrow.

associated expansion of the cryosphere around the North Atlantic, 
which increases surface albedo (Rugenstein et  al. 2013; Winton 
et al. 2013), as well as cloud cover variations and modiﬁcations 
in water vapour content (Trossman et al. 2016). As the uptake of 
excess heat occurs preferentially in regions with delayed warming 
(Winton et  al. 2013; Frölicher et  al. 2015; Armour et  al. 2016), 
a potential large reduction of the AMOC may shift the uptake of 
excess heat from the low to the high latitudes (Rugenstein et al. 
2013; Winton et al. 2013), where the atmosphere is more sensitive 
to external forcing (Winton et al. 2010; Rose et al. 2014; Rose and 
Rayborn, 2016; Rugenstein et al. 2016). A decrease in AMOC may 
also decrease the subduction of anthropogenic carbon to deeper 
waters (Zickfeld et al. 2008; Winton et al. 2013; Randerson et al. 
2015; Rhein et al. 2017). A potential impact of methane emissions 
has also been highlighted for past Heinrich events during which 
massive icebergs discharge in the North Atlantic may have led to 
large AMOC disruptions. Large increases (>100 ppb) in methane 
production have been associated with these events (Rhodes et al. 
2015) potentially due to increased wetland production in the SH, 
related to teleconnections of the North Atlantic with tropical area 
(Ringeval et al. 2013; Zurcher et al. 2013). All these different effects 
indicate a potentially positive feedback of the AMOC on the carbon 
cycle (Parsons et  al. 2014), although other elements from the 
terrestrial biosphere may limit its strength or even reverse its sign 
(Bozbiyik et al. 2011). 
Changes in Atlantic Ocean circulation can also strongly impact 
marine life and can be seen at all levels of different ecosystems. 
For instance, changes in the abundance and distribution of 
species in response to circulation changes in the SPG have been 
documented amongst plankton (Hátún et  al. 2009), ﬁsh (Payne 
et al. 2012; Miesner and Payne, 2018), seabirds (Descamps et al. 
2013) and top predators such as tuna, billﬁsh and pilot whales 
(Hátún et al. 2009; MacKenzie et al. 2014). Nutrient concentrations 
in the northeast Atlantic have also been shown to be limited by 
the recent weakening of the SPG, with concomitant ecosystem 
impacts (Johnson et  al. 2013; Hátún et  al. 2016). The inﬂuence 
of SPG circulation also extends to ecosystems beyond from the 
immediate area, and has a clear impact on the productivity of cod 
(Gadus morhua) in the Barents Sea, for example (Årthun et al. 2017; 
Årthun et al. 2018). On a broader scale, changes in the AMOC are an 
important driver of AMV, which has also been linked to substantial 
changes in marine ecosystems on both sides of the North Atlantic 
(Alheit et al. 2014; Nye et al. 2014). Recent AMOC weakening is also 
suspected to explain large marine deoxygenation in the northwest 
coastal Atlantic (Claret et al. 2018). In addition, a recent study using 
a marine productivity proxy from Greenland ice cores suggest that 
net primary productivity has decreased by 10 ± 7% in the subarctic 
Atlantic over the past two centuries possibly related to changes 
in AMOC (Osman et al. 2019). Finally, a model study investigated 
the impact of mitigation by reversing the forcing from a RCP8.5 
scenario from 2100 and found that global marine net productivity 
may recover very rapidly and even overshoot contemporary values 
at the end of the reversal, highlighting the potential beneﬁt of 
mitigation (John et al. 2015).
Following all these potential impacts, it has been suggested that 
a collapse of the AMOC may have the potential to induce a cascade 
of abrupt events, related to the crossing of thresholds from different 
tipping points, itself potentially driven by GIS rapid melting. For 
example, a collapse of the AMOC may induce causal interactions like 
changes in ENSO characteristics (Rocha et al. 2018), dieback of the 
Amazon rainforest and shrinking of the WAIS due to seesaw effect, 
ITCZ southern migration and large warming of the Southern Ocean 
(Cai et al. 2016). However, such a worst case scenario remains very 
poorly constrained quantitatively due to the large uncertainty in GIS 
and AMOC response to global warming. 
The potential impacts of such rapid changes in ocean circulation on 
agriculture, economy and human health remain poorly evaluated up 
to now with very few studies on the topic (Kopits et al. 2014). The 
available impact literature on AMOC weakening has focussed on 
impacts from temperature change only (reduced warming), globally 
leading to economic beneﬁts (e.g., Anthoff et al. 2016), and local 
losses can amount to a few percent of gross domestic product (GDP), 
however under a complete shutdown (Link and Tol, 2011). Declines in 
Barents Sea ﬁsh species could lead to economic losses (Link and Tol, 
2009), but more comprehensive economic studies are lacking.
6.7.3 
Risk Management and Adaptation
The numerous potential impacts of AMOC weakening (see 
Section  6.7.2) require adaptation responses. A speciﬁc adaptation 
action is a monitoring and early warning system using observation 
and prediction systems, which can help to respond in time to effects 
of an AMOC decline. Although it is difﬁcult to warn very early for 
large changes in AMOC to come, notably due to large natural decadal 
variability of the AMOC (Boulton et al. 2014), the observation arrays 
that are in place may allow the development of such an early 
warning system. Nevertheless, the prospects for its operational use 
for early warnings have not yet been fully developed. In this respect, 
developing early warning systems that do not depend on statistical 
timeseries analysis of long observational record might be seen as an 
important research goal in the future.
Decadal prediction systems can help ﬁll this gap. Skilful prediction of 
AMOC variation has been demonstrated on the multi-annual scale 
(Matei et  al. 2012) and retrospective prediction experiments have 
demonstrated that the large changes in the SPG seen in the mid-1990s 
could have been foreseen several years in advance (Wouters et  al. 
2013; Msadek et al. 2014). The World Climate Research Programme’s 
grand challenge of launching decadal predictions every year (Kushnir 
et al. 2019) is an important step towards anticipating rapid changes 
in the near term and can drive decadal-scale climate services. For 
example, a few studies have already shown that small variations 
anticipated by decadal predictions (e.g., Sheen et  al. 2017) can be 
useful for the development of climate services, notably for agriculture 
in south and east Africa (Nyamwanza et al. 2017). Decadal predictions 
also match the decision making time horizons of many users of the 
ocean (Tommasi et al. 2017b) and are expected to play an increasingly 
important role in this sector in the future (Payne et al. 2017).

6.8 
Compound Events and Cascading Impacts
6.8.1 
Concepts
Compound events refer to events that are characterised by multiple 
failures that can amplify overall risk and/or cause cascading impacts 
(Helbing, 2013; Gallina et al. 2016; Figure 6.1). These impacts may be 
triggered by multiple hazards that occur coincidently or sequentially 
and can lead to substantial disruption of natural or human systems 
(Leonard et al. 2014; Oppenheimer et al. 2014; Gallina et al. 2016; 
Zscheischler et al. 2018). These concepts are illustrated in a series 
of recent case studies that show how compound events interact 
with multiple elements of the ecosystem and society to create 
compound risk and cascading impacts (Box 6.1).
Compound events and cascading impacts are examples of deep 
uncertainty because data deﬁciency often prevents the assessment 
of probabilities and consequences of the risks from compound 
events. Furthermore, climate drivers that contribute to compound 
events could cross tipping points in the future (e.g., Cai et al. 2016; 
Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1). Concepts and methods for 
addressing compound events and cascading impacts have a solid 
foundation in disaster risk reduction frameworks (Scolobig, 2017) 
where they may be assessed with scenarios, risk mapping, and 
participatory governance (Marzocchi et  al. 2012; Komendantova 
et  al. 2014). However, these approaches have tended to not 
consider the effects of climate change, rather considering hazards 
and vulnerability as stationary entities (Gallina et al. 2016). Trends 
in geophysical and meteorological extreme events and their 
interaction with more complex social, economic and environmental 
vulnerabilities overwhelm existing governance and institutional 
capacities (Shimizu and Clark, 2015) because of the aggregated 
cascading impacts. 
6.8.2 
Multiple Hazards
Understanding regions where changes in the climate system could 
increase the likelihood or severity of multiple hazards is relevant 
to understanding compound events (Figure 6.1). Several recent 
studies have highlighted coastal regions that are becoming more 
susceptible to multiple hazards from changes in regional climate. 
Warming and poleward expansion of the warm western boundary 
current regions (WBCs; Yang et al. 2016a) together with intensiﬁed 
cyclogenesis in these WBC regions; the Gulf Stream (Booth et al. 
2012), the Kuroshio (Hirata et  al. 2016) and the East Australian 
Current (EAC; Pepler et al. 2016a) can increase the likelihood of 
multiple hazards. These include increased rates of SLR (Brunnabend 
et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017b) together with increases in severe 
rainfall, storm surges and associated ﬂooding (Thompson et al. 2013; 
Oey and Chou, 2016; Pepler et al. 2016a). WBCs have undergone an 
intensiﬁcation and poleward expansion in all but the Gulf Stream 
where the weakening of the AMOC cancelled this effect (Seager 
and Simpson, 2016; Yang et al. 2016a). 
Acknowledging the dual role of regional SLR and TCs frequency and 
intensity changes for future ﬂood risk, Little et al. (2015) developed 
a ﬂood index that takes account of local projected SLR along 
with TC frequency and intensity changes in a CMIP5 multi-model 
ensemble. They ﬁnd that relative to 1986–2005, the Flood Index is 
4–75 times higher by 2080–2099 for RCP2.6 (10–90th percentile 
range) and 35–350 times higher for RCP8.5. In the vicinity of the 
East Australian Current, Pepler et  al. (2016b) found warmer SSTs 
boost the intensiﬁcation of weak to moderate ETC’s. Neglecting 
the compounding effects of ﬂood and extreme sea level drivers can 
cause signiﬁcant underestimation of ﬂood risk and projected failure 
probability (Wahl et al. 2016; Moftakhari et al. 2017). 
Over the last decade, several efforts have been made to address 
long-term shoreline change driven by the cascading impact of SLR, 
waves and MSL. Ranasinghe et al. (2012) presented the Probabilistic 
Coastline Recession model, which provides probabilistic estimates of 
coastline recession in response to both storms and SLR in the 21st 
century. Dune recession is estimated for each storm considering 
the recovery between storms, which is obtained empirically. More 
recently, Toimil et al. (2017) developed a methodology to address 
shoreline change over this century due to the action of waves, storm 
surges, astronomical tides in combination with SLR. The methodology 
considers the generation of thousands of multi-variate hourly time 
series of waves and storm surges to reconstruct future shoreline 
evolution probabilistically, which enables estimates of extreme 
recessions and long-term coastline change to be obtained. The model 
proposed by Vitousek et al. (2017) integrates longshore and cross-
shore transport induced by GCM-projected waves and SLR, which 
allows it to be applied to both long and pocket sandy beaches. The 
analysis provides only one instance of what coastline change over 
the 21st century may be.
To summarise, new studies highlight regions such as coasts including 
those adjacent to WBCs, that are experiencing larger changes 
to multiple phenomena simultaneously such as SLR and cyclone 
intensity linked to higher SST increases (medium conﬁdence), which 
increases the likelihood of extremes from multiple hazards occurring 
(medium conﬁdence). Failing to account for the multiple factors 
responsible for extreme events will lead to an underestimation of the 
probabilities of occurrence (high conﬁdence).
6.8.3 
Cascading Impacts on Ecosystems 
Damage and loss of ecosystems (mangrove, coral reefs, polar deserts, 
wetlands and salt marshes); or regime shifts in ecosystem communities 
lead to reduced resilience of all the ecosystems and possible ﬂow-on 
effects to human systems. For example, recent studies showed that 
living corals and reef structures have experienced signiﬁcant losses 
from human-related drivers such as coastal development; sand and 
coral mining; overﬁshing, acidiﬁcation, and climate-related storms and 
bleaching events (Smith, 2011; Nielsen et al. 2012; Hilmi et al. 2013; 
Graham et al. 2015; Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Hughes et al. 2017b). 
As a consequence, reef ﬂattening is taking place globally due the loss 
of corals and from the bio-erosion and dissolution of the underlying 
reef carbonate structures (Alvarez-Filip et al. 2009). Reef mortality 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks

625
and ﬂattening due to non-climate and climate-related drivers trigger 
cascading impacts and risks due to the loss of the protection services 
provided to coastal areas. High emission scenarios are expected to 
lead to almost the complete loss of coral cover by 2100, although 
policies aiming to lower the combined aerosol-radiation interaction 
and aerosol-cloud interaction (e.g.,  IPCC RCP  6.0) may partially 
limit the impacts on coral reefs and the associated habitat loss, 
thereby preserving an estimated 14 to 20 billion USD in consumer 
surplus 2100 (2014 USD, 3% discount; Speers et al. 2016). Moreover, 
projected SLR will increase ﬂooding risks, and these risks will be even 
greater if reefs that now help protect coasts from waves are lost due 
to bleaching-induced mortality. 
6.8.4 
Cascading Impacts on Social Systems
Impacts of compound events also have signiﬁcant multi-effects in 
the societal system. Cascading impacts are particularly driven by 
the loss or (temporary) disruption of critical infrastructure (Pescaroli 
and Alexander, 2018), such as communications, transport, and 
power supply, on housing, dams and ﬂood protection; as well as 
health provision. Repeated extreme and compound events are 
leading to critical transitions in social systems (Kopp et al. 2016) 
which may cause the disruption of (local) communities, creating 
cascading impacts consisting of short-term impacts as well as long-
lasting economic effects, and in some cases migration. When the 
responses of the economic sector to short term weather variations 
are applied to long term-climate projections, risks associated with 
climate change on different sectors are projected to result in an 
average 1.2% of decrease of US GDP per degree Celsius of warming. 
Furthermore, broad geographical discrepancies generate a  large 
transfer of value northwards and westwards with the expected 
consequence of increased economic inequality (Hsiang et al. 2017). 
The severity and intensity of the cascading impacts also depend 
on the affected societies’ vulnerability and resilience. For example, 
the intensity and inﬂuence of compound events are dependent 
on the size and scale of the affected society and the percentage 
of economy or GDP impacted (Handmer et al. 2012 in IPCC SREX). 
Smaller countries and especially small islands face the challenge of 
being unable to ‘hedge’ the risk through geographical redistribution 
(see Cross-Chapter Box 9). 
Impacts from the natural system can descend into a cascade of 
disasters. For example, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina led to heavy 
ﬂooding in the coastal area, dike breaches, emergency response 
failures, chaos in evacuation (trafﬁc jams) and social disruption. 
Flooding in Thailand in 2011 led to the closure of many factories 
which not only impacted on the country’s economy but impaired 
the global automobile and electronic industry (Kreibich et  al. 
2014). Female-owned establishments are more challenged with 
failures than businesses owned by men due to less experience, 
shorter duration and smaller size of businesses (Haynes et al. 2011; 
Marshall et al. 2015). The impact of compound events on ecosystems 
can also, in the long run, have devastating impacts on societal 
systems, for example, impacts from tropical storms can lead to coral 
degradation, which leads to increased wave impact and subsequent 
accelerated coastal erosion and impacts on ﬁshing resources. This 
subsequently can have an impact on local economies, potentially 
leading to social disruption and migration (Saha, 2017). Impacts 
on marine ecosystems and habitats will also affect subsistence and 
commercial ﬁsheries and, as a result, food security (Barrow et al. 
2018). Climate-induced community relocations in Alaska stem from 
repeated extreme weather events coupled with climate change-
induced coastal erosion and these impact the habitability of the 
whole community (Bronen, 2011; Durrer and Adams, 2011; Marino, 
2011; Marino, 2012; Bronen and Chapin, 2013; see also Cross-
Chapter Boxes 2 and 5 in Chapter 1).
6.8.5 
Risk Management and Adaptation, 
Sustainable and Resilient Pathways
The management of compound events and cascading impacts in 
the context of governance poses challenges, partly because it is 
place dependent and heavily inﬂuenced by local parameters such 
as hazard experience and cultural values. Moreover, in some cases, 
people perceive that their community or country is less affected than 
others, leading to a ‘spatial optimism bias’ that delays or reduces 
the scope of actions (Nunn et al. 2016). In other cases it is unclear 
who will take responsibility when compound events and cascading 
impacts occur (Scolobig, 2017), although for some compound risks 
(e.g., na-tech disasters – when natural hazards trigger technological 
disasters), the private sector cooperates with governments to 
manage and respond to risks (Krausmann et al. 2017). Considerable 
variations exist among and inside countries. The level of engagement 
depends on the process of cascading impacts and the role of 
governance arrangement at the country level (Lawrence et  al. 
2018), countries’ capacity to develop integrated risk and disaster 
frameworks and regulations, viable multi-stakeholder and public-
private partnership in the case of multiple technological and natural 
hazards (Gerkensmeier and Ratter, 2018), the initiatives of local 
governments to exercise compound risk operations, and experience 
in interagency cooperation (Scolobig, 2017). The importance of local 
knowledge and traditional practices in disaster risk prevention and 
reduction is widely recognised (Hiwasaki et al. 2014; Hilhorst et al. 
2015; Audefroy and Sánchez, 2017) (high conﬁdence). The need to 
strengthen DRM is evident and can be improved and communicated 
effectively by integrating local knowledge such as Inuit’s indigenous 
knowledge and local knowledge in Alaska (Pearce et al. 2015; Cross-
Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1) since it is easier for communities to 
accept than pure science-based DRM (Ikeda et al. 2016). 
Despite difﬁculties of governance and decision making, many 
researchers and policy makers have recognised the need to study 
combined climatic and other hazards and their impacts. Several 
methods are now being employed to assess climatic hazards 
and compound events simultaneously, and also in combination 
(Klerk  et  al. 2015; van den Hurk et  al. 2015; Wahl et  al. 2015; 
Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017; Wu et al. 2018; Zscheischler et al. 
2018). Policy makers can also begin to plan for disaster risk reduction 
and adaptation, based on these analyses of compound events 
and risks. Addressing limitations in understanding the compound 
hazards, as well as adequate mechanisms of the cascading impacts 
is needed. Finally, there are limits to resources to study these 
Chapter 6 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks

626
complex interactions in sufﬁcient detail, as well as limits to data and 
information on past events that would allow the simulation of these 
effects, including economic impacts.
6.8.6 
Global Impact of Tipping Points
A small number of studies (Lontzek et  al. 2015; Cai et  al. 2016; 
Lemoine and Traeger, 2016) use different versions of the Dynamic 
Integrated Climate-Economy assessment model (Nordhaus, 1992; 
Nordhaus, 2017) to assess the impact of diverse sets of tipping 
points and causal interactions between them on the socially optimal 
reduction of gas emissions and the present social cost of carbon, 
representing the economic cost caused by an additional ton of CO2 
emissions or its equivalent.
Cai et  al. (2016) consider ﬁve interacting, stochastic, potential 
climate tipping points: reorganisation of the AMOC; disintegration 
of the GIS; collapse of the WAIS; dieback of the Amazon Rain Forest; 
and shift to a more persistent El Niño regime. The deep uncertainties 
associated with the likelihood of each of these tipping points and the 
dependence of them on the state of the others is addressed through 
expert elicitation. There is limited evidence, but high agreement that 
present costs of carbon are clearly underestimated. Double (Lemoine 
and Traeger, 2016), triple (Ceronsky et al. 2011), to eightfold (Cai et al. 
2016) increase of the carbon price are suggested, depending on the 
working hypothesis. Cai et al. (2016) indicate that with the prospect 
of multiple interacting tipping points, the present social cost of 
carbon increases from 15 to 116 USD per tonne of CO2, and conclude 
that stringent efforts are needed to reduce CO2 emission if these 
impacts are to be avoided.
Box 6.1 |  Multiple Hazards, Compound Risk and Cascading Impacts 
The following case studies illustrate that anthropogenic climate change including ocean changes is increasingly having a discernible 
inﬂuence on elements of the climate system by exacerbating extreme events and causing multiple hazards, often with compound 
or sequential characteristics. In turn these elements are interacting with vulnerability and exposure to trigger compound events 
and cascading impacts.
Case Study 1: Tasmania’s Summer of 2015–2016
Tasmania in southeast Australia experienced multiple extreme climate events in 2015–2016, driven by the combined 
effects of natural modes of climate variability and anthropogenic climate change, with impacts on the energy sector, 
ﬁsheries and emergency services. The driest warm season on record (October to April), together with the warmest summer on 
record, brought agricultural and hydrological droughts to Tasmania and preconditioned the sensitive highland environment for 
major ﬁres during the summer. Thousands of lightning strikes during the ﬁrst two months of the year led to more than 165 separate 
vegetation ﬁres, which burned more than 120,000 hectares including highland zones and the World Heritage Area and incurred costs 
to the state of more than 50 million AUD (Press, 2016).
In late January an intense cutoff low-pressure system brought heavy rainfall and ﬂoods, so that emergency services were simultaneously 
dealing with highland ﬁres and ﬂoods in the east and north. The ﬂoods were followed by an extended wet period for Tasmania, with 
the wettest wet season (April to November) on record in 2016. Meanwhile, an intense marine heatwave (MHW) off the east coast 
persisted for 251 days from spring 2015 through to autumn 2016 (Oliver et al. 2017).
The driest October on record was inﬂuenced by both the El Niño and anthropogenic forcing (Karoly et al. 2016). Warmer sea 
surface temperatures (SSTs) due to anthropogenic warming may have increased the intensity of rainfall during the ﬂoods in January 
(e.g., Pepler et al. 2016a). The intensity and the duration of the MHW was unprecedented and both aspects had a clear human 
signature (Oliver et al. 2017). 
Tasmania primarily relies on hydro-electric power generation and the trading of power over an undersea cable to mainland Australia, 
‘Basslink’, for its energy needs. Lake levels in hydro-electric dams were at relatively low levels in early spring 2015, and the extended dry 
period led to further reductions and signiﬁcantly reduced capacity to generate power (Hydro Tasmania, 2016). An unanticipated failure of 
the Basslink cable subsequently necessitated the use of emergency diesel generators (Hydro Tasmania, 2016).
The compound events caused many impacts on natural systems, agriculture, infrastructure and communities. Additional emergency 
services from outside the state were needed to deal with the ﬁres. The MHW caused disease outbreaks in farmed shellﬁsh, mortality 
in wild shellﬁsh and species found further south than previously recorded. The energy sector experienced a severe cascade of impacts 
due to climate stressors and system inter-dependencies. The combination of drought, ﬁres, ﬂoods and MHW reduced output from the 
agriculture, forestry, ﬁshing and energy sectors and reduced the State of Tasmania gross state product (GSP) to 1.3%, well below the 
anticipated growth of 2.5%. To address the energy shortages, Tasmania’s four largest industrial energy users, responsible for 60% 
of Tasmania’s electricity usage, agreed to a series of voluntary load reductions of up to 100 MW on a sustained basis, contributing 
to a 1.7% reduction in the output of the manufacturing sector (Eslake, 2016). The total cost of the ﬁres and ﬂoods was assessed at 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks

Box 6.1 (continued)
300 million USD. In response funding has been increased to government agencies responsible for managing ﬂoods and bushﬁres, 
and multiple independent reviews have recommended major policy reforms that are now under consideration (Blake, 2017; Tasmanian 
Climate Change Ofﬁce, 2017).
This case illustrates the concepts presented in Figure 6.1. Anthropogenic climate change likely contributed to the severity of multiple 
hazards; including coincident and sequential events (droughts and bushﬁres, followed by extreme rainfall and ﬂoods). Compound 
risks, including risks for the safety of residents affected by ﬂoods and ﬁres, the natural environment affected by MHWs and ﬁres and 
the economy in the food and energy sectors arose from these climate events with cascading impacts on the industrial sector more 
broadly as it responded to the shortfall in energy supply. 
Extremes experienced in 2015–2016 in Tasmania are projected to become more frequent or more intense due to climate change, 
including dry springs and summers (Bureau of Meteorology and Australian CSIRO, 2007), intense lows bringing extreme rains and 
ﬂoods in summer (Grose et al. 2012), and MHWs on the east coast associated with convergence of heat linked to the East Australia 
Current (Oliver et al. 2017) indicating that climate change by increasing the frequency or intensity of multiple climate events will likely 
increase compound risk and cascading impacts (high conﬁdence).
Case Study 2: The Coral Triangle
The Coral Triangle is under the combined threats of mean warming, ocean acidiﬁcation, temperature and sea level 
variability (often associated with both El Niño and La Niña), coastal development and overﬁshing, leading to reduced 
ecosystem services and loss of biodiversity. The Coral Triangle covers 4 million square miles of ocean and coastal waters in 
Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁc, in the area surrounding Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Timor Leste and 
the Solomon Islands. It is the centre of the highest coastal marine biodiversity in the world due to its geological setting, physical 
environment, and an array of ecological and evolutionary processes which makes it a conservation priority. Together with mangroves 
and seagrass beds, the 605 species of corals including 15 regional endemics (Veron et al. 2011) provide ecosystem services to over 100 
million people from diverse and rich cultures, in particular for food, building materials and coastal protection. 
The riches of the ecosystems in the Coral Triangle led to expanding human activities, such as coastal development to accommodate 
a booming tourism sector and overﬁshing. There is agreement that these activities, including coastal deforestation, coastal reclamation, 
destructive ﬁshing methods and over-exploitation of marine life generate important pressures on the ecosystem (Pomeroy et al. 2015; 
Ferrigno et al. 2016; Huang and Coelho, 2017). As a result, the coastal ecosystems of the Coral Triangle have already lost 40% of their 
coral reefs and mangroves over the past 40 years (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2009). 
Risks from compound events include increase in sea surface temperature (SST), SLR and increased human activities. The increasing trend 
in SSTs was estimated to be 0.1ºC per decade between 1960 and 2007 (Kleypas et al. 2015) but increased to 0.2ºC per decade from 1985 
to 2006 (Penaﬂor et al. 2009), an estimation comparable with that in the South China Sea (Zuo et al. 2015). However, waters in 
the northern and eastern parts are warming faster than the rest of the region, and this variability is increased by local parameters 
linked to the complex bathymetry and oceanography of the region (Kleypas et al. 2015). Areas in the eastern part have experienced 
more thermal stress events, and these appear to be more likely during La Niña events, which generate heat pulses in the region, 
leading to bleaching events, some of them already triggered by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In the Coral Triangle, El 
Niño events have a relative cooling effect, while La Niña events are accompanied by warming (Penaﬂor et al. 2009). The 1997–1998 
El Niño was followed by a strong La Niña so that degree heating weeks (DHW) values in many parts of the region were greater than 
four, which caused widespread coral bleaching (DHW values greater than zero indicate there is thermal stress, while DHW values of 
4 and greater indicate the existence of sufﬁcient thermal stress to produce signiﬁcant levels of coral bleaching; Kayanne, 2017). 
However, in Indonesia, the 2015–2016 El Niño event had impacted shallow water reefs well before high SSTs could trigger any coral 
bleaching (Ampou et al. 2017). Sea level in Indonesia had been at its lowest in the past 12 years following this El Niño event and 
this had affected corals living in shallow waters. Substantial mortality was likely caused by higher daily aerial exposure during 
low tides and warmer SST associated with shallow waters. Another climate change-associated impact in the Coral Triangle is ocean 
acidiﬁcation. Although less exposed than other reefs at higher latitudes (van Hooidonk et al. 2013), changes in pH are expected to 
affect coral calciﬁcation (DeCarlo et al. 2017), with an impact on coral reef ﬁsheries (Speers et al. 2016).
At present, different approaches are used to manage the different risks to coral ecosystems in the Coral Triangle such as ﬁsheries 
management (White et al. 2014) and different conservation initiatives (Beger et al. 2015), including coral larval replenishment 
(dela Cruz and Harrison, 2017) and the establishment of a region-wide marine protected area system (e.g., Christie et al. 2016).

Box 6.1 (continued)
There is high conﬁdence that reefs with high species diversity are more resilient to stress, including bleaching (e.g., Ferrigno et al. 2016; 
Mellin et al. 2016; Mori, 2016). Sustainable Management of coastal resources, such as marine protected areas is thus a commonly 
used management approach (White et al. 2014; Christie et al. 2016), supported in some cases by ecosystem modelling projections 
(Weijerman et al. 2015; Weijerman et al. 2016). Evaluations of these management approaches led to the development of guiding 
frameworks and supporting tools for coastal area managers (Anthony et al. 2015); however biological and ecological factors are still 
expected to limit the adaptive capacity of these ecosystems to changes (Mora et al. 2016).
Case Study 3: Severe Atlantic Hurricanes of 2017
The above-average hurricane activity of the 2017 season led to the sequential occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria 
on the Caribbean and southern US coasts (Klotzbach and Bell, 2017), collectively causing 265 billion USD damage and making 2017 
the costliest hurricane season on record (Blake et al. 2011; Blake and Zelinsky, 2018). 
The role of climate change in contributing to the severity of these recent hurricanes has been much discussed in the public and media. 
It has not been possible to identify robust long-term trends in either hurricane frequency or strength given the large natural variability, 
which makes trend detection challenging especially given the opposing inﬂuences of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols on past 
changes. However, observational data shows a warming of the surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and indeed most of the world’s 
oceans, over the past century as human activities have had an increasing impact on our climate (Sobel et al. 2016).
Hurricane Harvey brought unprecedented rainfall to Texas and produced a storm surge that exceeded 2 m in some regions 
(Shuckburgh et al. 2017). Climate change increased the rainfall intensity associated with Harvey by at least 8% (8–19%; Risser 
and Wehner, 2017; van Oldenborgh et al. 2017) (high conﬁdence). Emanuel (2017) estimated that the annual probability of 500 mm of 
area-averaged rainfall had increased from 1% in the period 1981–2000 to 6% in 2017. Furthermore, if society were to follow RCP8.5, 
the probability would increase to 18% over the period 2081–2100. 
The event attribution method of Emanuel (2017) indicates that for TC Irma, which impacted the Caribbean islands of Barbuda and 
Cuba, the annual probability of encountering Irma’s peak wind of 160 knots within 300 km of Barbuda increased from 0.13% in the 
period 1981–2000 to 0.43% by 2017, and will further increase to 1.3% by 2081–2100 assuming RCP8.5. TC Maria followed Irma, 
and made landfalls on the island of Dominica, Puerto Rico, and Turks and Caicos Islands. The annual probability of encountering 
Maria’s peak wind of 150 knots within 150 km of 17ºN, 64ºW increased from 0.5% during 1981–2000 to 1.7% in 2017, and will 
increase to 5% by 2081–2100 assuming RCP8.5. 
At least 68 people died from the direct effects of Harvey in Houston (Blake and Zelinsky, 2018). The Houston metropolitan area 
was devastated with the release of about 4.6 million pounds of contaminants from petrochemical plants and reﬁneries. Irma caused 
44 direct deaths (Cangialosi et al. 2018) and wiped out housing, schools, ﬁsheries and livestock in Barbuda, Antigua, St. Martin 
and the British Virgin Islands (ACAPS et al. 2017). Maria caused 31 direct deaths in Dominica, two in Guadeloupe and around 65 
in Puerto Rico (Pasch et al. 2018), and completely vacated Barbuda. Maria destroyed almost all power lines, buildings and 80% 
of crops in Puerto Rico (Rexach et al. 2017; Rosselló, 2017), and damaged pharmaceutical industries that provided 33% of Puerto 
Rico’s gross domestic product (GDP) causing shortages of some medical supplies in the USA (Sacks et al. 2018). The effects of Maria 
are expected to increase the poverty rate by 14% because of unemployment in tourism and agriculture sectors for more than a year 
in Dominica (The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, 2017), and resulted in outmigration to neighboring countries or 
the USA (ACAPS et al. 2017; Rosselló, 2017). These economic and social consequences are indicative of the cascading impact of the 
2017 hurricanes. The post-disaster reconstruction plan is to renovate telecommunications, develop climate resilient building plans and 
emergency coordination (Rosselló, 2017; The Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, 2017).
Collectively, these case studies indicate that climate change has played a role in multiple coincident or sequential extreme events that 
have led to cascading impacts (high conﬁdence). Climate change is projected to increase the frequency or intensity of multiple climate 
events in the future and this will likely increase risks of compound events and cascading impacts (high conﬁdence).

6.9.1 
Decision Making for Abrupt Change 
and Extreme Events 
As outlined earlier in this report, several approaches exist for adaptive 
responses towards climate change impacts. Other sections that 
deal with adaptation responses to extremes include Section 1.5.2, 
Section 4.4 (SLR and coastal ﬂooding), Cross Chapter Box 4 in 
Chapter 1 and Section 5.5.2.5 in Chapter 5 (adaptation limits for 
coastal infrastructure and ecosystems). Here, we address adaptation 
responses especially to abrupt and extreme changes (for responses to 
special abrupt changes (e.g., AMOC; see also Section 6.7).
Since AR5, growing discussions have advocated for transformative 
adaptation, implying that they support fundamental societal shift 
towards sustainability and climate-resilient development pathways 
(Moloney et  al. 2017; IPCC, 2018; Morchain, 2018). Successful 
adaptation to abrupt change and extreme events incorporates 
climate change concerns and the impact of climate extremes on 
vulnerable populations taking into account community participation 
and local knowledge (Tozier de la Poterie and Baudoin, 2015). These 
interventions reduce risk and enhance resilience, and contribute to 
the SDGs and social justice (Mal et al. 2018). Temporal scales denote 
before and after abrupt changes and extreme events (prevention and 
post-event response), long- and short-term adaptation measures, and 
the lag time between forecast, warning and event (Field et al. 2012; 
IPCC, 2012). Spatial dimensions include local risk management and 
adaptation as well as regional and international coordination to 
prepare for unexpected extremes tackling the impacts at multiple 
geographic scales (Devine-Wright, 2013; Barnett et  al. 2014; 
Lyth et al. 2016; Barange et al. 2018). 
Decision making about abrupt change or extreme events is not 
autonomous; it is constrained by formal and informal institutional 
processes such as regulatory structures, property rights, as well as 
culture, traditions and social norms (Field et al. 2012; IPCC, 2012). 
Efforts in various countries and large cities to improve resilience 
and adaptation are growing, and these efforts are linked to a global 
network of research, information and best practices (e.g., Aerts et al. 
2014). In both northern and southern high latitudes, extreme climatic 
conditions and remoteness from densely populated regions constrain 
human choices. The question is whether responses to extremes 
and abrupt changes require approaches that are different from 
the anticipatory management of adaptation to changes in climate 
and weather extremes. While there are several impact studies on 
extreme events and abrupt change, very few focus on the necessity of 
dedicated individual, governmental or business adaptive responses 
(Tol et al. 2006; Anthoff et al. 2010; Anthoff et al. 2016).
Making appropriate decisions to manage abrupt change and 
extreme events given deep uncertainty is challenging (Weaver et al. 
2013; see Cross-Chapter Boxes 4 and 5 in Chapter 1). This requires 
the construction of new models integrating different uncertainties 
under extreme or abrupt scenarios and evaluation of value for money 
(Weaver et al. 2013). Examples include the inclusion of rapid SLR 
for assessing coastal impacts and adaptation options (Ranger et al. 
2013; Haasnoot et  al. 2018; see Sections 6.4 and 6.7). Decision 
analysis frameworks such as ‘Robust Decision Making’, ‘Decision 
Scaling’, ‘Assess Risk of Policy’, ‘Info-gap’, ‘Dynamic Adaptation 
Policy Pathways’, ‘Dynamic Adaptive Pathways Planning’, ‘Multi-
Criteria Decision Analysis’, ‘Real Options Analysis’ and ‘Context-First’ 
accommodate a wide range of uncertainties with subsequent socio-
ecological impact (Weaver et al. 2013). The central question remains, 
however, how one can overcome path dependencies which may 
cause technical lock-ins in the current system. Monitoring systems 
of climatic and derived variables, in order to predict necessary shifts 
in adaptation policies are in development (Haasnoot et al. 2015). 
However, these frameworks have so far been mostly applied to more 
gradual shifts of climate change, rather than extreme events and 
abrupt changes.
Request for the use of ‘actionable’ information and communication 
based on climate science and modelling will increase (McNie, 2007; 
Moser and Boykoff, 2013). Such information can only be effective 
when it is perceived as ‘credible, salient, and legitimate’ (Paton, 2007; 
Paton, 2008; Dilling et al. 2015). Since SREX (IPCC, 2012), there is 
medium conﬁdence that trust in the information and the institution 
(Hardin, 2002; Townley and Garﬁeld, 2013) that governs extreme 
events and abrupt change (Malka et al. 2009; Birkmann et al. 2011; 
Schoenefeld and McCauley, 2016) is important. Trust in expert and 
scientiﬁc knowledge helps people make sense of climate change 
impact and engage with adaptation measures (Moser and Boykoff, 
2013; Yeh, 2016). Without such knowledge, people have little 
recourse to believe and evaluate relevant information (Bråten et al. 
2011). Individuals who trust their government can be complacent and 
do not prepare for the consequences of extremes (Simpson, 2012; 
Edmondson and Levy, 2019), and shift the responsibility to the 
government (Edmondson and Levy, 2019). Familiarity with and 
information about hazards, community characteristics, as well as 
the relationship between people and government agencies inﬂuence 
the level of trust (Paton, 2007).
Recent literature shows that there are crucial differences between the 
ethical challenges of mitigation and those of adaptation (Wallimann-
Helmer, 2015; Wallimann-Helmer, 2016) in their dealings with Loss 
and Damage (L&D); and the ongoing analysis disputes how to 
distribute responsibilities between mitigation and adaptation based 
on climate justice criteria (Wallimann-Helmer et al. 2019). The Warsaw 
International Mechanism on L&D under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) addresses irreversible 
changes and limits to adaptation at the global scale (see also Cross-
Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). This is in contrast to national and local 
policies, addressing impacts and adaptation. Within the SROCC report, 
several of the documented and projected irreversible or unavoidable 
and thus residual impacts beyond adaptation would potentially fall 
under this category (e.g., Warner and van der Geest, 2013; Huggel 
et al. 2019; Mechler et al. 2019), including impacts from SLR, land 
erosion and reduced freshwater resources on small islands, changes 
in high mountains and cryosphere changes, as well as changes in 
ocean species and resources. Apart from climate hazards, risks for 
L&D are also determined by increasing exposure and vulnerability 
Chapter 6 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks
6
630
(Birkmann and Welle, 2015). Such impacts can be assessed using 
conventional frameworks, but the debate on the precise scope of 
such impacts remains, including those from anthropogenic climate 
change impacts as well as natural climate variability and extremes 
(e.g., James et al. 2014). More work is required to explore the range 
of activities available for responding to L&D resulting from slow onset 
processes in the scope of the SROCC report such as ocean acidiﬁcation 
(Harrould-Kolieb and Hoegh-Guldberg, 2019) and mountain cryosphere 
changes (Huggel et al. 2019).
Under the same L&D mechanism, risk transfer mechanisms and 
insurance have been suggested as a speciﬁc adaptation policy option. 
Several forms of ‘climate change’ insurance have been proposed 
recently, but their potential for adaptation has met with criticism, 
importantly because of the costs of formal insurance and other risk 
transfer options, as well as issues with sustainability given the lack 
of loss prevention and adaptation (Surminski et al. 2016; Linnerooth-
Bayer et al. 2019). A compensation mechanism for low-lying small 
islands inclusive of L&D proposal is in progress (Adelman, 2016). 
Insurance (see also Section 4.4.4) can help absorb extreme shocks for 
both individuals, using traditional insurance and parametric insurance. 
Sovereign insurance mechanisms can help governments absorb large 
losses (Linnerooth-Bayer et  al. 2019), but eventually they need to 
be coupled with other incentives for adaptation and risk reduction 
measures to be cost-effective (Botzen, 2013) (medium conﬁdence).
There is a consensus that investing in disaster risk reduction has 
economic beneﬁts, although there is medium evidence about the 
range of the estimated beneﬁts which varies from a global estimate 
of two to four dollars saved for each dollar invested (Kull et al. 2013; 
Mechler, 2016) to about 400 EUR per invested 1 EUR in the case 
of ﬂood early warning systems in Europe (Pappenberger et  al. 
2015). The US Federal Emergency Management Agency indicated 
that a  1%  increase in annual investment in ﬂood management 
decreases ﬂood damage by 2.1% (Davlasheridze et  al. 2017). 
Conserving ecosystems that provide services for risk reduction also 
has monetary beneﬁts. Wetlands have been observed to reduce 
damages during storms. Wetlands and ﬂoodplains in Otter Creek 
(Vermont, USA) reduced damages caused by storms by 54–78% and 
84–95%, respectively, for Tropical Storm Irene (Watson et al. 2016). 
For the whole of the USA, wetlands provide 23.2 billion USD yr–1 
in storm protection services and the loss of 1 hectare of wetland is 
estimated to correspond to an average 33,000 USD increase in storm 
damage from speciﬁc storms (Costanza et  al. 2008). Engineered 
structures are also expected to reduce risks. In Europe, to maintain 
the coastal ﬂood loss constant relative to the size of the economy, 
ﬂood defence structures need to be able to protect coastal areas for 
a projected increase of sea level between 0.5–2.5 m. Without these 
risk reduction actions, the expected damages from coastal ﬂoods 
could increase by two or three degrees of magnitude compared to 
the present (Vousdoukas et al. 2018). Although risk reduction actions 
are generally considered an effective way to reduce the damages by 
shifting the loss-exceedance curve, cost-beneﬁt analysis of disaster 
risk reduction actions faces several challenges, including its limited 
role in informing decisions, spatial and temporal uncertainty scales, 
and discounting and choice of discount rate that affect cost-beneﬁt 
analysis results heavily (Mechler, 2016).
6.9.2 
Transformative Governance and 
Integrating Disaster Risk Reduction 
and Climate Change Adaptation
Governance for effective adaptation deﬁned as changes in practice, 
process and structure (Smit et al. 2001) considers equity, legitimacy 
and co-beneﬁts (Patterson et  al. 2018) appropriate to the issue 
(Young, 2002). Countries, sectors and localities place different values 
and perspectives on these categories, and they can change over time 
(Plummer et al. 2017; see Cross-Chapter Boxes 1 and 2 in Chapter 1). 
Transformative governance embraces a wider application of climate 
change-induced mitigation and adaptation strategies to generate 
fundamental change. It is society-wide and goes beyond the goals 
of climate change policies and measures (IPCC, 2013; Patterson et al. 
2018). It is distinguished from conventional strategies and solutions, 
as it includes both natural and human systems and intertwines with 
the SDGs (Fleurbaey et al. 2014; Tàbara et al. 2019). Transformational 
adaptation is also needed when incremental adaptation to extreme 
events and abrupt changes is insufﬁcient (Kates et  al. 2012). 
Planned retreat from SLR and climate refugees illustrate the need for 
transformative governance as the current coastal and risk management 
regimes do not have the capacity to handle these issues adequately. 
Inclusion of bilateral and regional agreements related to climate-
induced migration (McAdam, 2011), land use planning frameworks to 
respond to policy, institutional and cultural implications of migration 
(Matthews and Potts, 2018), and identiﬁcation of beneﬁciaries of 
managed retreat (Hino et al. 2017) along with positive opportunities 
for migrants to diversify income and avoid being in harm’s way 
(Gemenne, 2015) are steps towards transformative governance. 
Retreat and migration entail local responses that include indigenous 
and local knowledges and perspectives that can be applied to solve 
these issues (Farbotko and Lazrus, 2012; Hilhorst et al. 2015; Tharakan, 
2015; Iloka, 2016; Nunn et al. 2016; see also Cross-Chapter Boxes 2 
and 5 in Chapter 1). Another example is the Polar region which has 
started to pursue transformative governance given the potential for 
increased tourism and cooperation that require changed governance 
structure (see  Sections 3.5.2; 3.5.5 and Table 3.7 in Chapter 3). 
Accountability for transformations and transitions has been identiﬁed 
as a crucial factor to support responsible action and strengthen 
climate governance (Edmondson and Levy, 2019).
Though discourse abounds related to transformative governance, it 
falls short of its ideal in climate change action plans as it is unclear 
whether communities have the capacity to engage in substantive 
change to build low-carbon and resilient communities (Burch et al. 
2014). The results of a study on the USA by Tang and Dessai (2012) 
indicate that climate adaptation and mitigation plans’ treatment 
of extreme climate conditions and disaster preparedness is limited. 
Moreover, risk communication with the public is part of an integrated 
disaster warning system, but behavioural response to disaster 
warnings are often governed by personal beliefs about the nature of 
the hazard; and ultimately swaying individual decisions to comply with 
or ignore the warning message (Mayhorn and McLaughlin, 2014). 
New approaches such as the ‘ﬁrst mile’ of early warning systems, 
built on the speciﬁc needs from beneﬁciary communities instead 
of on technological progress, are being implemented (Zommers 
et al. 2017); but they have not yet been assessed. 
Extremes, Abrupt Changes and Managing Risks 
Chapter 6

631
Coupling disaster risk reduction and management with climate 
change adaptation effort – following the set targets of UNFCCC 
and the Sendai Framework – has shown progress since SREX and 
AR5 (e.g., Lawrence and Saunders, 2017). Substantial literature 
exists on the topic, but there is little assessment of practices on the 
ground in the implementation of integrated disaster management 
and climate change adaptation (Nalau et al. 2016) including health 
(Banwell et al. 2018). Mainstreaming disaster risk reduction and 
climate change adaptation within and across sectors is considered 
essential to ensure administrative coordination and coherence 
across sectoral plans and policies (Shimizu and Clark, 2015) 
(medium conﬁdence). Financial and technological support and 
capacity building especially related to public works, savings or loans 
enable households to build assets and improve livelihoods (Ulrichs 
et al. 2019). No assessment is available so far of the efﬁciency and 
effectiveness of mainstreaming especially related to the integration 
of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, let alone 
for abrupt and extreme impacts.
Case studies of integration note major problems, for example, weak 
coordination among government agencies (Seidler et al. 2018); lack 
of data and user-friendly information to guide decision making 
at the local level (Jones et al. 2017) and the need for the central 
governmental support for data availability (Putra et  al. 2018); 
fragmentation due to competing local objectives (Forino et  al. 
2017); dependence on regional and international frameworks in 
the absence of a national framework (Rivera and Wamsler, 2014); 
limited availability of formal training in integration (Hemstock et al. 
2017); and turf wars between responsible government agencies 
(Nemakonde and Van Niekerk, 2017). The case of Paciﬁc islands 
such as Vanuatu is indicative of these problems. Though they have 
coupled disaster risk reduction with climate change adaptation, 
problems manifest in relationships, responsibilities, capacity and 
expectations between government agencies and other actors 
(e.g., international donors and non-governmental organisations), as 
analysed by Vanuatu’s response to the Category 5 TC Pam (Nalau 
et al. 2017). Some solutions are proposed such as getting all the 
actors on the same page and focusing on reducing vulnerability to 
longer-term environmental hazards (Schipper et al. 2016); focussing 
on speciﬁc goals, objectives and strategies (Organization of American 
States, 2014); assigning a single department to handle integration 
(APEC,  2016); and citing real-life decision examples in national 
guidelines (Bell et  al. 2017). Place-based responses also entail 
the inclusion and the acknowledgement of indigenous and local 
knowledge for an enhanced resilience pathway (Hilhorst et al. 2015; 
Tharakan, 2015; Iloka, 2016; Nunn et al. 2016). 
Given the signiﬁcance of disaster risk reduction to enhance climate 
change adaptation regardless of the integration of the two, the 
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 focuses 
on seven targets and four priorities that foster participation beyond 
information sharing and include partnerships and collaborations 
within society (UNISDR, 2015). Inclusion of, and coordination 
between, different stakeholders is a key component for managing 
risks of extreme events, including in a changing climate (medium 
conﬁdence). In the Wadden Sea coastal area, for example, crucial 
parts of coordinating disaster risk reduction, include (i) responsibility-
sharing among authorities, sectors and stakeholders, (ii) all-of-society 
engagement and partnership with empowerment and inclusive 
participation, and (iii) development of international, regional, 
subregional and transboundary cooperation schemes (González-
Riancho et al. 2017). In India, a change in the coordination structure 
was pivotal in reducing fatalities from over 10,000 to 45 between 
cyclones Orissa (Odisha) in 1999 and Phailin in 2013. In this case, 
the Disaster Management Act of 2005 established a comprehensive 
policy and command and control system during disaster response 
that empowered the most qualiﬁed government ofﬁcials regardless of 
their rank. This system provides authority to and holds accountability 
for those in charge of ground operations. Though this rigid system 
may sometimes be questioned, a uniﬁed and top-down command 
structure works better when there is a lack of mature disaster 
management system (Pal et al. 2017).
In sum, limiting the risk from the impact of extreme events and 
abrupt changes leads to successful adaptation to climate change if 
climate-affected sectors and disaster management relevant agencies 
coordinate well (high conﬁdence). Transformative governance, 
including successful integration of disaster risk management and 
climate change adaptation, empowerment of vulnerable groups, 
accountability of governmental decisions, and longer-term planning 
promotes climate-resilient development pathways (high conﬁdence). 
An enhanced understanding of the institutional capacity as well as 
the legal framework addressing abrupt changes and extreme events 
is especially important (medium conﬁdence). 
Knowledge gaps limit the identiﬁcation of the most relevant actions 
to achieve and pursue climate-resilient development pathways. 
Since SREX and AR5, there is little research on indirect impacts of 
climatic extremes on ecosystems and consequences on poverty and 
livelihoods critical to the SDGs. For example, adaptation solutions 
and limitations, including governance challenges, for the ocean do 
not include extreme events (Sections 5.5.2 and 5.5.3 in Chapter 5). 
Further, there is only scant literature on L&D, including non-economic 
impacts, resulting from well-documented processes such as MHWs 
(Section 6.4), SLR impacts on low-lying coasts (Section 4.3), and 
cryosphere changes (Section 2.3; Chapter 3) (high conﬁdence). 
Limited information is available concerning the cost-beneﬁt and 
effectiveness of risk-reduction measures. Coupling risk transfer and 
insurance mechanisms with risk reduction measures, for example,

Frequently Asked Questions
FAQ 6.1 | 
 How can risks of abrupt changes in the ocean and cryosphere related to climate 
change be addressed?
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will reduce the occurrence of extreme events and the likelihood of abrupt changes. 
Abrupt changes can be irreversible on human time scales and, as tipping points, bring natural systems to novel conditions. To 
reduce risks that emerge from these impacts of climate change, communities can protect themselves or accommodate to the 
new environment. In the last resort, they may retreat from exposed areas. Governance that builds on diverse expertise and 
considers a variety of actions is best equipped to manage remaining risks.
Climate change is projected to inﬂuence extreme events and to potentially cause abrupt changes in the ocean 
and the cryosphere. Both these phenomena can add to the other, slow-onset impacts of climate change, such as 
a global warming or sea level rise (SLR). In addition, abrupt changes can be tipping points, bringing the ocean, 
cryosphere, as well as their ecosystems, or the whole climate system, to new conditions instead or going back to 
the ones prevailing before the abrupt change.
In the ocean, a possible abrupt change is associated with an interruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning 
Circulation (AMOC), an important component of global ocean circulation. A slowdown of the AMOC could 
have consequences around the world: rainfall in the Sahel region could reduce, hampering crop production; 
the summer monsoon in Asia could weaken; regional SLR could increase around the Atlantic, and there might 
be more winter storms in Europe. The collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is considered to be one of 
the tipping points for the global climate. Such an event can be triggered when ice shelves break and ice ﬂows 
towards the ocean. While, in general, it is difﬁcult to assess the probability of occurrence of abrupt climate 
events they are physically plausible events that could cause large impacts on ecosystems and societies and may 
be irreversible.
Reducing GHG emissions is the main action to limit global warming to acceptable levels and reduce the 
occurrence of extreme events and abrupt changes. However, in addition to mitigation, a variety of measures 
and risk management strategies supports adaptation to future risks. Future risks linked to abrupt changes 
are strongly inﬂuenced by local conditions and different characteristics of the events themselves and evolve 
differently depending on the circumstances. One major factor for adaptation is whether the extreme events 
will simply amplify the known impacts or whether they will cause completely new conditions, which may be 
related to a tipping point. Another essential factor is whether an extreme event or abrupt change will happen 
in isolation or in conjunction with other events, in a chain of cascading impacts or as part of a compound risk 
where several events happen at the same time so that impacts can multiply each other. Also, impacts are heavily 
aggravated by increasing exposure and changes in vulnerability, for example reducing the availability of food, 
water and energy supply, and not just the occurrence of extremes themselves. 
Successful management of extreme events and abrupt changes in the ocean and cryosphere involves all available 
resources and governance approaches, including among others land-use and spatial planning, indigenous 
knowledge and local knowledge. The management of the risks to ecosystems include their preservation, the 
sustainable use of resources and the recognition of the value of ecosystem services. There are three general 
approaches that, alone or in combination, can enable communities to adapt to these events: retreat from the 
area, accommodation to new conditions and protection. All have advantages and limitations and their success 
will depend on the speciﬁc circumstances and the community’s level of adaptability. But only transformative 
governance that integrates a variety of strategies and beneﬁts from institutional change helps to address 
larger risks posed by compound events. Integrating risk-reduction approaches into institutional practices and 
inclusive decision making that builds on the respective competences of different government agencies and other 
stakeholders can support management of these extremes. A change of lifestyles and livelihoods might further 
support the adaptation to new conditions.

Knowledge Gaps
A comprehensive, detailed list of all the knowledge gaps that have 
been identiﬁed during the assessment performed in this chapter 
is not possible, hence we focus here on gaps that are relevant for 
multiple phenomena.
Detection, attribution and projection of physical aspects of climate 
change at regional and local scales are generally limited by 
uncertainties in the response of climate models to changes in GHGs 
and other forcing agents. Additionally, regionally-based attribution 
studies for extreme events may be lacking in some areas, possibly 
reﬂecting the lack of capacity or imperative by regional and national 
technical institutions to undertake such studies. Thermodynamic 
aspects of change may be more robust than those involving changes 
in dynamics e.g., the tracks of TCs or ocean dynamical components of 
MHW formation. Increasing resolution and improvements in climate 
models may help to reduce uncertainty. However, because extreme 
events and highly nonlinear changes (e.g., AMOC collapse) are, by 
deﬁnition, found in the ‘tails’ of distributions, ensembles or long 
climate model runs may be required.
While it may not be possible to quantify the likelihood of very rare 
events or irreversible phenomena, it may be possible to quantify 
their impacts on natural and human systems. Such information may 
be more useful to policy makers (Sutton, 2018). Impacts on natural 
systems (e.g., marine ecosystems) are in general better quantiﬁed 
than impacts on human systems, but there are still many gaps in 
the literature for the phenomena assessed here (e.g., future impacts 
of extreme El Niño and La Niña events). The body of literature on 
compound risks and cascading impacts is growing but is still rather 
small. One area where there seems to be a serious lack of literature 
is in the assessment of the economic impacts of extreme and 
abrupt/irreversible events.
Literature on managing risks and adaptation strategies for abrupt 
and irreversible events is sparse, as is the literature on the combined 
impacts of climate-driven events and societal development or 
maladaptation. The same is true for compound risks and cascading 
impacts. Theory on transformative governance is emerging but 
practical demonstrations are few.
Finally, research is still often ‘siloed’ in physical modelling, ecosystem 
modelling, social sciences etc. Researchers who can cross boundaries 
between these disciplines will help accelerate research in the areas 
covered by this chapter.
