Summary for Policymakers
Introduction
This Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere1 in a Changing Climate (SROCC) was prepared following an IPCC Panel 
decision in 2016 to prepare three Special Reports during the Sixth Assessment Cycle2. By assessing new scientiﬁc literature3, 
the SROCC4 responds to government and observer organization proposals. The SROCC follows the other two Special Reports 
on Global Warming of 1.5ºC (SR1.5) and on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)5 and the Intergovernmental Science Policy 
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) compiles key ﬁndings of the report and is structured in three parts: SPM.A: Observed 
Changes and Impacts, SPM.B: Projected Changes and Risks, and SPM.C: Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere 
Change. To assist navigation of the SPM, icons indicate where content can be found. Conﬁdence in key ﬁndings is reported 
using IPCC calibrated language6 and the underlying scientiﬁc basis for each key ﬁnding is indicated by references to sections 
of the underlying report.

The cryosphere is deﬁned in this report (Annex I: Glossary) as the components of the Earth System at and below the land and ocean surface that are 
frozen, including snow cover, glaciers, ice sheets, ice shelves, icebergs, sea ice, lake ice, river ice, permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground.

The decision to prepare a Special Report on Climate Change and Oceans and the Cryosphere was made at the Forty-Third Session of the IPCC in 
Nairobi, Kenya, 11–13 April 2016.

The SROCC is produced under the scientiﬁc leadership of Working Group I and Working Group II. In line with the approved outline, mitigation options 
(Working Group III) are not assessed with the exception of the mitigation potential of blue carbon (coastal ecosystems).

The full titles of these two Special Reports are: “Global Warming of 1.5ºC. An IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5ºC above 
pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of 
climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty”; “Climate Change and Land: an IPCC special report on climate change, 
desertiﬁcation, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas ﬂuxes in terrestrial ecosystems”.

Each ﬁnding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, 
medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium conﬁdence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of 
an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90–100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, 
very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely. This is consistent with AR5 and the other 
AR6 Special Reports. Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, more unlikely than likely 0–<50%, extremely 
unlikely 0–5%) are used when appropriate. This Report also uses the term ‘likely range’ or ‘very likely range’ to indicate that the assessed likelihood 
of an outcome lies within the 17–83% or 5–95% probability range. {1.9.2, Figure 1.4}

High mountain areas include all mountain regions where glaciers, snow or permafrost are prominent features of the landscape. For a list of high 
mountain regions covered in this report, see Chapter 2. Population in high mountain regions is calculated for areas less than 100 kilometres from 
glaciers or permafrost in high mountain areas assessed in this report. {2.1} Projections for 2050 give the range of population in these regions across 
all ﬁve of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}

Population in the low elevation coastal zone is calculated for land areas connected to the coast, including small island states, that are less than 
10 metres above sea level. {Cross-Chapter Box 9} Projections for 2050 give the range of population in these regions across all ﬁve of the Shared 
Socioeconomic Pathways. {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71% of the 
Earth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth’s water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth 
system1. Around 10% of Earth’s land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support 
unique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of 
water, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced 
greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia 
that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1, 1.2}
Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing 
States, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains7 are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea 
level rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to 
changes in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in 
the Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone8 is currently home to around 680 million 
people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home 
to 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous 
peoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is 
projected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4–8.7% of the projected global population). 
{1.1, 2.1, 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 2.1} 
In addition to their role within the climate system, such as the uptake and redistribution of natural and anthropogenic 
carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat, as well as ecosystem support, services provided to people by the ocean and/or 
cryosphere include food and water supply, renewable energy, and beneﬁts for health and well-being, cultural values, 
tourism, trade, and transport. The state of the ocean and cryosphere interacts with each aspect of sustainability 
reﬂected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). {1.1, 1.2, 1.5}

Summary for Policymakers
A. Observed Changes and Impacts 
Observed Physical Changes
A.1 
Over the last decades, global warming has led to widespread shrinking of the cryosphere, 
with mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers (very high conﬁdence), reductions in snow cover 
(high conﬁdence) and Arctic sea ice extent and thickness (very high conﬁdence), and increased 
permafrost temperature (very high conﬁdence). {2.2, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
A.1.1 
 Ice sheets and glaciers worldwide have lost mass (very high conﬁdence). Between 2006 and 
2015, the Greenland Ice Sheet9 lost ice mass at an average rate of 278 ± 11 Gt yr–1 (equivalent to 0.77 ± 0.03 mm yr–1 of 
global sea level rise)10, mostly due to surface melting (high conﬁdence). In 2006–2015, the Antarctic Ice Sheet lost 
mass at an average rate of 155 ± 19 Gt yr–1 (0.43 ± 0.05 mm yr–1), mostly due to rapid thinning and retreat of major 
outlet glaciers draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (very high conﬁdence). Glaciers worldwide outside Greenland 
and Antarctica lost mass at an average rate of 220 ± 30 Gt yr–1 (equivalent to 0.61 ± 0.08 mm yr–1 sea level rise) in 
2006–2015. {3.3.1, 4.2.3, Appendix 2.A, Figure SPM.1}
A.1.2  
 Arctic June snow cover extent on land declined by 13.4 ±  5.4% per decade from 1967 
to 2018, a  total loss of approximately  2.5  million km2, predominantly due to surface air temperature increase 
(high conﬁdence). In nearly all high mountain areas, the depth, extent and duration of snow cover have declined over 
recent decades, especially at lower elevation (high conﬁdence). {2.2.2, 3.4.1, Figure SPM.1}
A.1.3  
 Permafrost temperatures have increased to record high levels (1980s–present) 
(very high conﬁdence) including the recent increase by 0.29ºC ± 0.12ºC from 2007 to 2016 averaged across polar 
and high mountain regions globally. Arctic and boreal permafrost contain 1460–1600 Gt organic carbon, almost twice 
the carbon in the atmosphere (medium conﬁdence). There is medium evidence with low agreement whether northern 
permafrost regions are currently releasing additional net methane and CO2 due to thaw. Permafrost thaw and glacier 
retreat have decreased the stability of high mountain slopes (high conﬁdence). {2.2.4, 2.3.2, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Figure SPM.1} 
A.1.4  
 Between 1979 and 2018, Arctic sea ice extent has very likely decreased for all months of the 
year. September sea ice reductions are very likely 12.8 ± 2.3% per decade. These sea ice changes in September are 
likely unprecedented for at least 1000 years. Arctic sea ice has thinned, concurrent with a transition to younger ice: 
between 1979 and 2018, the areal proportion of multi-year ice at least ﬁve years old has declined by approximately 
90% (very high conﬁdence). Feedbacks from the loss of summer sea ice and spring snow cover on land have 
contributed to ampliﬁed warming in the Arctic (high conﬁdence) where surface air temperature likely increased 
by more than double the global average over the last two decades. Changes in Arctic sea ice have the potential to 
inﬂuence mid-latitude weather (medium conﬁdence), but there is low conﬁdence in the detection of this inﬂuence 
for speciﬁc weather types. Antarctic sea ice extent overall has had no statistically signiﬁcant trend (1979–2018) due 
to contrasting regional signals and large interannual variability (high conﬁdence). {3.2.1, 6.3.1, Box 3.1, Box 3.2,

(l) Change in near-surface (within 3–4 m) permafrost area in the Northern Hemisphere {3.4.1, 3.4.2, Figure 3.10}. Assessments of projected changes 
under the intermediate RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios are not available for all variables considered here, but where available can be found in the 
underlying report. {For RCP4.5 see: 2.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2, 3.2.2, 3.4.2, 4.2.3, for RCP6.0 see Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}

This scaling factor (global-mean ocean expansion as sea level rise in metres per unit heat) varies by about 10% between different models, and it will 
systematically increase by about 10% by 2100 under RCP8.5 forcing due to ocean warming increasing the average thermal expansion coefﬁcient.

CMIP5 is Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Annex I: Glossary). 
15 
A pathway with lower emissions (RCP1.9), which would correspond to a lower level of projected warming than RCP2.6, was not part of CMIP5.
16 
In some instances this report assesses changes relative to 2006–2015. The warming from the 1850–1900 period until 2006–2015 has been assessed 
as 0.87ºC (0.75 to 0.99ºC likely range). {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Assessments of projected future changes in this report are based largely on CMIP514 climate model projections using 
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCPs are scenarios that include time series of  emissions 
and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as 
land use / land cover. RCPs provide only one set of many possible scenarios that would lead to different levels of 
global warming. {Annex I: Glossary}
This report uses mainly RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in its assessment, reﬂecting the available literature. RCP2.6 represents 
a low greenhouse gas emissions, high mitigation future, that in CMIP5 simulations gives a two in three chance of 
limiting global warming to below 2ºC by 210015. By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario 
in the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric 
greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the 
highest greenhouse gas emissions. The underlying chapters also reference other scenarios, including RCP4.5 and 
RCP6.0 that have intermediate levels of greenhouse gas emissions and result in intermediate levels of warming. 
{Annex I: Glossary, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Table SPM.1 provides estimates of total warming since the pre-industrial period under four different RCPs for key 
assessment intervals used in SROCC. The warming from the 1850–1900 period until 1986–2005 has been assessed 
as 0.63ºC (0.57ºC to 0.69ºC likely range) using observations of near-surface air temperature over the ocean and over 
land.16 Consistent with the approach in AR5, modelled future changes in global mean surface air temperature relative 
to 1986–2005 are added to this observed warming. {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}

Summary for Policymakers
A.2  
It is virtually certain that the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up 
more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system (high conﬁdence). Since 1993, the rate 
of ocean warming has more than doubled (likely). Marine heatwaves have very likely doubled 
in frequency since 1982 and are increasing in intensity (very high conﬁdence). By absorbing 
more CO2, the ocean has undergone increasing surface acidiﬁcation (virtually certain). A loss 
of oxygen has occurred from the surface to 1000 m (medium conﬁdence). {1.4, 3.2, 5.2, 6.4, 6.7, 
Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
A.2.1.  
 The ocean warming trend documented in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) has 
continued. Since 1993 the rate of ocean warming and thus heat uptake has more than doubled (likely) from 3.22 
± 1.61 ZJ yr–1 (0–700 m depth) and 0.97 ± 0.64 ZJ yr–1 (700–2000 m) between 1969 and 1993, to 6.28 ± 0.48 ZJ 
yr–1 (0–700 m) and 3.86 ± 2.09 ZJ yr–1 (700–2000 m) between 1993 and 2017 17, and is attributed to anthropogenic 
forcing (very likely). {1.4.1, 5.2.2, Table 5.1, Figure SPM.1}
A.2.2  
 The Southern Ocean accounted for 35–43% of the total heat gain in the upper 2000 
m global ocean between 1970 and 2017 (high conﬁdence). Its share increased to 45–62% between 2005 and 2017 
(high conﬁdence). The deep ocean below 2000 m has warmed since 1992 (likely), especially in the Southern Ocean. 
{1.4, 3.2.1, 5.2.2, Table 5.1, Figure SPM.2}
A.2.3  
 Globally, marine heat-related events have increased; marine heatwaves18, deﬁned when 
the daily sea surface temperature exceeds the local 99th percentile over the period 1982 to 2016, have doubled 
in frequency and have become longer-lasting, more intense and more extensive (very likely). It is very likely that 
between 84–90% of marine heatwaves that occurred between 2006 and 2015 are attributable to the anthropogenic 
temperature increase. {Table 6.2, 6.4, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
A.2.4  
 Density stratiﬁcation19 has increased in the upper 200 m of the ocean since 1970 (very likely). 
Observed surface ocean warming and high latitude addition of freshwater are making the surface ocean less dense 
relative to deeper parts of the ocean (high conﬁdence) and inhibiting mixing between surface and deeper waters 
(high conﬁdence). The mean stratiﬁcation of the upper 200 m has increased by 2.3 ± 0.1% (very likely range) from 
the 1971–1990 average to the 1998–2017 average. {5.2.2}
A.2.5  
 The ocean has taken up between 20–30% (very likely) of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions 
since the 1980s causing further ocean acidiﬁcation. Open ocean surface pH has declined by a very likely range 
of 0.017–0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s20, with the decline in surface ocean pH very likely to have 
already emerged from background natural variability for more than 95% of the ocean surface area. {3.2.1, 5.2.2, 
Box 5.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
17 
ZJ is Zettajoule and is equal to 1021 Joules. Warming the entire ocean by 1ºC requires about 5500 ZJ; 144 ZJ would warm the top 100 m by about 1ºC.
18 
A marine heatwave is a period of extreme warm near-sea surface temperature that persists for days to months and can extend up to thousands of 
kilometres (Annex I: Glossary).
19 
In this report density stratiﬁcation is deﬁned as the density contrast between shallower and deeper layers. Increased stratiﬁcation reduces the vertical 
exchange of heat, salinity, oxygen, carbon, and nutrients.

Summary for Policymakers
A.2.6  
 Datasets spanning 1970–2010 show that the open ocean has lost oxygen by a very likely 
range of 0.5–3.3% over the upper 1000 m, alongside a likely expansion of the volume of oxygen minimum zones 
by 3–8% (medium conﬁdence). Oxygen loss is primarily due to increasing ocean stratiﬁcation, changing ventilation 
and biogeochemistry (high conﬁdence). {5.2.2, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
A.2.7  
 Observations, both in situ (2004–2017) and based on sea surface temperature reconstructions, 
indicate that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)21 has weakened relative to 1850–1900 
(medium conﬁdence). There is insufﬁcient data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening, or to properly attribute 
it to anthropogenic forcing due to the limited length of the observational record. Although attribution is currently not 
possible, CMIP5 model simulations of the period 1850–2015, on average, exhibit a weakening AMOC when driven by 
anthropogenic forcing. {6.7}
A.3  
Global mean sea level (GMSL) is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing 
rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high conﬁdence), as well as 
continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. Increases in tropical cyclone winds 
and rainfall, and increases in extreme waves, combined with relative sea level rise, exacerbate 
extreme sea level events and coastal hazards (high conﬁdence). {3.3, 4.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Figures 
SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM.4, SPM.5}
A.3.1  
 Total GMSL rise for 1902–2015 is 0.16 m (likely range 0.12–0.21 m). The rate of GMSL rise for 
2006–2015 of 3.6 mm yr–1 (3.1–4.1 mm yr–1, very likely range), is unprecedented over the last century (high conﬁdence), 
and about 2.5 times the rate for 1901–1990 of 1.4 mm yr–1 (0.8– 2.0 mm yr–1, very likely range). The sum of ice 
sheet and glacier contributions over the period 2006–2015 is the dominant source of sea level rise (1.8 mm yr–1, very 
likely range 1.7–1.9 mm yr–1), exceeding the effect of thermal expansion of ocean water (1.4 mm yr–1, very likely 
range 1.1–1.7 mm yr–1) 22 (very high conﬁdence). The dominant cause of global mean sea level rise since 1970 is 
anthropogenic forcing (high conﬁdence). {4.2.1, 4.2.2, Figure SPM.1}
A.3.2  
 Sea level rise has accelerated (extremely likely) due to the combined increased ice loss from 
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high conﬁdence). Mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over the period 
2007–2016 tripled relative to 1997–2006. For Greenland, mass loss doubled over the same period (likely, medium 
conﬁdence). {3.3.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM A.1.1}
A.3.3  
 Acceleration of ice ﬂow and retreat in Antarctica, which has the potential to lead to sea 
level rise of several metres within a few centuries, is observed in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica 
and in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica (very high conﬁdence). These changes may be the onset of an irreversible23 ice 
sheet instability. Uncertainty related to the onset of ice sheet instability arises from limited observations, inadequate 
model representation of ice sheet processes, and limited understanding of the complex interactions between the 
atmosphere, ocean and the ice sheet. {3.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.2.3}
A.3.4  
 Sea level rise is not globally uniform and varies regionally. Regional differences, within ±30% 
of the global mean sea level rise, result from land ice loss and variations in ocean warming and circulation. Differences 
from the global mean can be greater in areas of rapid vertical land movement including from local human activities 
(e.g. extraction of groundwater). (high conﬁdence) {4.2.2, 5.2.2, 6.2.2, 6.3.1, 6.8.2, Figure SPM.2}
21 
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is the main current system in the South and North Atlantic Oceans (Annex I: Glossary).
22 
The total rate of sea level rise is greater than the sum of cryosphere and ocean contributions due to uncertainties in the estimate of landwater storage change.
23 
The recovery time scale is hundreds to thousands of years (Annex I: Glossary).

Summary for Policymakers
A.3.5  
 Extreme wave heights, which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and 
ﬂooding, have increased in the Southern and North Atlantic Oceans by around 1.0 cm yr–1 and 0.8 cm yr–1 over the 
period 1985–2018 (medium conﬁdence). Sea ice loss in the Arctic has also increased wave heights over the period 
1992–2014 (medium conﬁdence). {4.2.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Box 6.1}
A.3.6  
 Anthropogenic climate change has increased observed precipitation (medium conﬁdence), 
winds (low conﬁdence), and extreme sea level events (high conﬁdence) associated with some tropical cyclones, which 
has increased intensity of multiple extreme events and associated cascading impacts (high conﬁdence). Anthropogenic 
climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western 
North Paciﬁc in recent decades related to anthropogenically-forced tropical expansion (low conﬁdence). There is 
emerging evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades 
(low conﬁdence). {6.2, Table 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Box 6.1}
Observed Impacts on Ecosystems
A.4  
Cryospheric and associated hydrological changes have impacted terrestrial and freshwater 
species and ecosystems in high mountain and polar regions through the appearance of land 
previously covered by ice, changes in snow cover, and thawing permafrost. These changes have 
contributed to changing the seasonal activities, abundance and distribution of ecologically, 
culturally, and economically important plant and animal species, ecological disturbances, and 
ecosystem functioning. (high conﬁdence) {2.3.2, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}
A.4.1  
 Over the last century some species of plants and animals have increased in abundance, shifted 
their range, and established in new areas as glaciers receded and the snow-free season lengthened (high conﬁdence). 
Together with warming, these changes have increased locally the number of species in high mountains, as 
lower-elevation species migrate upslope (very high conﬁdence). Some cold-adapted or snow-dependent species 
have declined in abundance, increasing their risk of extinction, notably on mountain summits (high conﬁdence). In 
polar and mountain regions, many species have altered seasonal activities especially in late winter and spring (high 
conﬁdence). {2.3.3, Box 3.4} 
A.4.2  
 Increased wildﬁre and abrupt permafrost thaw, as well as changes in Arctic and mountain 
hydrology have altered frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbances (high conﬁdence). This has included positive 
and negative impacts on vegetation and wildlife such as reindeer and salmon (high conﬁdence). {2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3}
A.4.3  
 Across tundra, satellite observations show an overall greening, often indicative of increased 
plant productivity (high conﬁdence). Some browning areas in tundra and boreal forest are indicative that productivity 
has decreased (high conﬁdence). These changes have negatively affected provisioning, regulating and cultural 
ecosystem services, with also some transient positive impacts for provisioning services, in both high mountains 
(medium conﬁdence) and polar regions (high conﬁdence). {2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Annex I: Glossary}

Summary for Policymakers
A.5  
Since about 1950 many marine species across various groups have undergone shifts in 
geographical range and seasonal activities in response to ocean warming, sea ice change and 
biogeochemical changes, such as oxygen loss, to their habitats (high conﬁdence). This has 
resulted in shifts in species composition, abundance and biomass production of ecosystems, 
from the equator to the poles. Altered interactions between species have caused cascading 
impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning (medium conﬁdence). In some marine 
ecosystems species are impacted by both the effects of ﬁshing and climate changes (medium 
conﬁdence). {3.2.3, 3.2.4, Box 3.4, 5.2.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.2}
A.5.1  
 Rates of poleward shifts in distributions across different marine species since the 1950s 
are 52  ±  33 km per decade and 29 ±  16 km per decade (very likely ranges) for organisms in the epipelagic 
(upper 200 m from sea surface) and seaﬂoor ecosystems, respectively. The rate and direction of observed shifts in 
distributions are shaped by local temperature, oxygen, and ocean currents across depth, latitudinal and longitudinal 
gradients (high conﬁdence). Warming-induced species range expansions have led to altered ecosystem structure 
and functioning such as in the North Atlantic, Northeast Paciﬁc and Arctic (medium conﬁdence). {5.2.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6, 
Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}
A.5.2  
 In recent decades, Arctic net primary production has increased in ice-free waters 
(high conﬁdence) and spring phytoplankton blooms are occurring earlier in the year in response to sea ice change 
and nutrient availability with spatially variable positive and negative consequences for marine ecosystems (medium 
conﬁdence). In the Antarctic, such changes are spatially heterogeneous and have been associated with rapid local 
environmental change, including retreating glaciers and sea ice change (medium conﬁdence). Changes in the 
seasonal activities, production and distribution of some Arctic zooplankton and a southward shift in the distribution 
of the Antarctic krill population in the South Atlantic are associated with climate-linked environmental changes 
(medium conﬁdence). In polar regions, ice associated marine mammals and seabirds have experienced habitat 
contraction linked to sea ice changes (high conﬁdence) and impacts on foraging success due to climate impacts on 
prey distributions (medium conﬁdence). Cascading effects of multiple climate-related drivers on polar zooplankton 
have affected food web structure and function, biodiversity as well as ﬁsheries (high conﬁdence). {3.2.3, 3.2.4, 
Box 3.4, 5.2.3, Figure SPM.2}
A.5.3  
 Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are amongst the most productive ocean 
ecosystems. Increasing ocean acidiﬁcation and oxygen loss are negatively impacting two of the four major upwelling 
systems: the California Current and Humboldt Current (high conﬁdence). Ocean acidiﬁcation and decrease in oxygen 
level in the California Current upwelling system have altered ecosystem structure, with direct negative impacts on 
biomass production and species composition (medium conﬁdence). {Box 5.3, Figure SPM.2}
A.5.4  
 Ocean warming in the 20th century and beyond has contributed to an overall decrease in 
maximum catch potential (medium conﬁdence), compounding the impacts from overﬁshing for some ﬁsh stocks 
(high conﬁdence). In many regions, declines in the abundance of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh stocks due to direct and indirect 
effects of global warming and biogeochemical changes have already contributed to reduced ﬁsheries catches 
(high conﬁdence). In some areas, changing ocean conditions have contributed to the expansion of suitable habitat and/
or increases in the abundance of some species (high conﬁdence). These changes have been accompanied by changes 
in species composition of ﬁsheries catches since the 1970s in many ecosystems (medium conﬁdence). {3.2.3, 5.4.1,

Summary for Policymakers
A.6  
Coastal ecosystems are affected by ocean warming, including intensiﬁed marine heatwaves, 
acidiﬁcation, loss of oxygen, salinity intrusion and sea level rise, in combination with adverse 
effects from human activities on ocean and land (high conﬁdence). Impacts are already 
observed on habitat area and biodiversity, as well as ecosystem functioning and services 
(high conﬁdence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.2}
A.6.1  
 Vegetated coastal ecosystems protect the coastline from storms and erosion and help 
buffer the impacts of sea level rise. Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as 
a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events 
(high  conﬁdence). Vegetated coastal ecosystems are important carbon stores; their loss is responsible for the 
current release of 0.04–1.46 GtC yr–1 (medium conﬁdence). In response to warming, distribution ranges of seagrass 
meadows and kelp forests are expanding at high latitudes and contracting at low latitudes since the late 1970s 
(high conﬁdence), and in some areas episodic losses occur following heatwaves (medium conﬁdence). Large-scale 
mangrove mortality that is related to warming since the 1960s has been partially offset by their encroachment into 
subtropical saltmarshes as a result of increase in temperature, causing the loss of open areas with herbaceous plants 
that provide food and habitat for dependent fauna (high conﬁdence). {4.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, Figure SPM.2}
A.6.2  
 Increased sea water intrusion in estuaries due to sea level rise has driven upstream 
redistribution of marine species (medium conﬁdence) and caused a reduction of suitable habitats for estuarine 
communities (medium conﬁdence). Increased nutrient and organic matter loads in estuaries since the 1970s from 
intensive human development and riverine loads have exacerbated the stimulating effects of ocean warming on 
bacterial respiration, leading to expansion of low oxygen areas (high conﬁdence). {5.3.1}
A.6.3 
 The impacts of sea level rise on coastal ecosystems include habitat contraction, geographical 
shift of associated species, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. Impacts are exacerbated by 
direct human disturbances, and where anthropogenic barriers prevent landward shift of marshes and mangroves 
(termed coastal squeeze) (high conﬁdence). Depending on local geomorphology and sediment supply, marshes and 
mangroves can grow vertically at rates equal to or greater than current mean sea level rise (high conﬁdence). 
{4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.7, 5.4.1}
A.6.4  
 Warm-water coral reefs and rocky shores dominated by immobile, calcifying (e.g., shell and 
skeleton producing) organisms such as corals, barnacles and mussels, are currently impacted by extreme temperatures 
and ocean acidiﬁcation (high conﬁdence). Marine heatwaves have already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching 
events at increasing frequency (very high conﬁdence) causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997, and recovery 
is slow (more than 15 years) if it occurs (high conﬁdence). Prolonged periods of high environmental temperature and 
dehydration of the organisms pose high risk to rocky shore ecosystems (high conﬁdence). {SR.1.5; 5.3.4, 5.3.5, 6.4.2,

Figure SPM.2 |  Synthesis of observed regional hazards and impacts in ocean24 (top) and high mountain and polar land regions (bottom) assessed 
in SROCC. For each region, physical changes, impacts on key ecosystems, and impacts on human systems and ecosystem function and services are 
shown. For physical changes, yellow/green refers to an increase/decrease, respectively, in amount or frequency of the measured variable. For impacts 
on ecosystems, human systems and ecosystems services blue or red depicts whether an observed impact is positive (beneﬁcial) or negative (adverse), 
respectively, to the given system or service. Cells assigned ‘increase and decrease’ indicate that within that region, both increase and decrease of 
physical changes are found, but are not necessarily equal; the same holds for cells showing ‘positive and negative’ attributable impacts. For ocean 
regions, the conﬁdence level refers to the conﬁdence in attributing observed changes to changes in greenhouse gas forcing for physical changes and to 
climate change for ecosystem, human systems, and ecosystem services. For high mountain and polar land regions, the level of conﬁdence in attributing 
physical changes and impacts at least partly to a change in the cryosphere is shown. No assessment means: not applicable, not assessed at regional 
scale, or the evidence is insufﬁcient for assessment. The physical changes in the ocean are deﬁned as: Temperature change in 0–700 m layer of the 
ocean except for Southern Ocean (0–2000 m) and Arctic Ocean (upper mixed layer and major inﬂowing branches); Oxygen in the 0–1200 m layer 
or oxygen minimum layer; Ocean pH as surface pH (decreasing pH corresponds to increasing ocean acidiﬁcation). Ecosystems in the ocean: Coral 
refers to warm-water coral reefs and cold-water corals. The ‘upper water column’ category refers to epipelagic zone for all ocean regions except Polar 
Regions, where the impacts on some pelagic organisms in open water deeper than the upper 200 m were included. Coastal wetland includes salt 
marshes, mangroves and seagrasses. Kelp forests are habitats of a speciﬁc group of macroalgae. Rocky shores are coastal habitats dominated by 
immobile calciﬁed organisms such as mussels and barnacles. Deep sea is seaﬂoor ecosystems that are 3000–6000 m deep. Sea-ice associated includes 
ecosystems in, on and below sea ice. Habitat services refer to supporting structures and services (e.g., habitat, biodiversity, primary production). 
Coastal Carbon Sequestration refers to the uptake and storage of carbon by coastal blue carbon ecosystems. Ecosystems on Land: Tundra refers to 
tundra and alpine meadows, and includes terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems.

Observed Impacts on People and Ecosystem Services
A.7  
Since the mid-20th century, the shrinking cryosphere in the Arctic and high mountain areas 
has led to predominantly negative impacts on food security, water resources, water quality, 
livelihoods, health and well-being, infrastructure, transportation, tourism and recreation, as 
well as culture of human societies, particularly for Indigenous peoples (high conﬁdence). Costs 
and beneﬁts have been unequally distributed across populations and regions. Adaptation 
efforts have beneﬁted from the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge 
(high conﬁdence). {1.1, 1.5, 1.6.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.4, 3.5, Figure SPM.2}
A.7.1  
 Food and water security have been negatively impacted by changes in snow cover, lake and 
river ice, and permafrost in many Arctic regions (high conﬁdence). These changes have disrupted access to, and food 
availability within, herding, hunting, ﬁshing, and gathering areas, harming the livelihoods and cultural identity of 
Arctic residents including Indigenous populations (high conﬁdence). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have 
contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including Hindu Kush Himalaya 
and the tropical Andes (medium conﬁdence). {2.3.1, 2.3.7, Box 2.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, Figure SPM.2}
A.7.2  
 In the Arctic, negative impacts of cryosphere change on human health have included 
increased risk of food- and waterborne diseases, malnutrition, injury, and mental health challenges especially among 
Indigenous peoples (high conﬁdence). In some high mountain areas, water quality has been affected by contaminants, 
particularly mercury, released from melting glaciers and thawing permafrost (medium conﬁdence). Health-related 
adaptation efforts in the Arctic range from local to international in scale, and successes have been underpinned by 
Indigenous knowledge (high conﬁdence). {1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 3.4.3}
A.7.3  
 Arctic residents, especially Indigenous peoples, have adjusted the timing of activities to respond 
to changes in seasonality and safety of land, ice, and snow travel conditions. Municipalities and industry are beginning 
to address infrastructure failures associated with ﬂooding and thawing permafrost and some coastal communities 
have planned for relocation (high conﬁdence). Limited funding, skills, capacity, and institutional support to engage 
meaningfully in planning processes have challenged adaptation (high conﬁdence). {3.5.2, 3.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
A.7.4  
 Summertime Arctic ship-based transportation (including tourism) increased over the past two 
decades concurrent with sea ice reductions (high conﬁdence). This has implications for global trade and economies 
linked to traditional shipping corridors, and poses risks to Arctic marine ecosystems and coastal communities 
(high conﬁdence), such as from invasive species and local pollution. {3.2.1, 3.2.4, 3.5.4, 5.4.2, Figure SPM.2}
A.7.5  
 In past decades, exposure of people and infrastructure to natural hazards has increased due 
to growing population, tourism and socioeconomic development (high conﬁdence). Some disasters have been linked 
to changes in the cryosphere, for example in the Andes, high mountain Asia, Caucasus and European Alps (medium 
conﬁdence). {2.3.2, Figure SPM.2}
A.7.6  
 Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and seasonality of runoff and 
water resources in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins (very high conﬁdence). Hydropower facilities have 
experienced changes in seasonality and both increases and decreases in water input from high mountain areas, for

example, in central Europe, Iceland, Western USA/Canada, and tropical Andes (medium conﬁdence). However, there 
is only limited evidence of resulting impacts on operations and energy production. {SPM B.1.4, 2.3.1}
A.7.7  
 High mountain aesthetic and cultural aspects have been negatively impacted by glacier 
and snow cover decline (e.g. in the Himalaya, East Africa, the tropical Andes) (medium conﬁdence). Tourism and 
recreation, including ski and glacier tourism, hiking, and mountaineering, have also been negatively impacted in 
many mountain regions (medium conﬁdence). In some places, artiﬁcial snowmaking has reduced negative impacts 
on ski tourism (medium conﬁdence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6, Figure SPM.2}
A.8  
Changes in the ocean have impacted marine ecosystems and ecosystem services with regionally 
diverse outcomes, challenging their governance (high conﬁdence). Both positive and negative 
impacts result for food security through ﬁsheries (medium conﬁdence), local cultures and 
livelihoods (medium conﬁdence), and tourism and recreation (medium conﬁdence). The 
impacts on ecosystem services have negative consequences for health and well-being (medium 
conﬁdence), and for Indigenous peoples and local communities dependent on ﬁsheries 
(high conﬁdence). {1.1, 1.5, 3.2.1, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, Figure SPM.2}
A.8.1  
 Warming-induced changes in the spatial distribution and abundance of some ﬁsh and 
shellﬁsh stocks have had positive and negative impacts on catches, economic beneﬁts, livelihoods, and local 
culture (high conﬁdence). There are negative consequences for Indigenous peoples and local communities that are 
dependent on ﬁsheries (high conﬁdence). Shifts in species distributions and abundance has challenged international 
and national ocean and ﬁsheries governance, including in the Arctic, North Atlantic and Paciﬁc, in terms of 
regulating ﬁshing to secure ecosystem integrity and sharing of resources between ﬁshing entities (high conﬁdence).

A.8.2  
 Harmful algal blooms display range expansion and increased frequency in coastal areas 
since the 1980s in response to both climatic and non-climatic drivers such as increased riverine nutrients run-off 
(high conﬁdence). The observed trends in harmful algal blooms are attributed partly to the effects of ocean warming, 
marine heatwaves, oxygen loss, eutrophication and pollution (high conﬁdence). Harmful algal blooms have had 
negative impacts on food security, tourism, local economy, and human health (high conﬁdence). The human 
communities who are more vulnerable to these biological hazards are those in areas without sustained monitoring 
programs and dedicated early warning systems for harmful algal blooms (medium conﬁdence). {Box 5.4, 5.4.2, 6.4.2}
A.9  
Coastal communities are exposed to multiple climate-related hazards, including tropical 
cyclones, extreme sea levels and ﬂooding, marine heatwaves, sea ice loss, and permafrost 
thaw (high conﬁdence). A diversity of responses has been implemented worldwide, mostly 
after extreme events, but also some in anticipation of future sea level rise, e.g., in the case of 
large infrastructure. {3.2.4, 3.4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 5.4.2, 6.2, 6.4.2, 6.8, Box 6.1, Cross 
Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
A.9.1  
 Attribution of current coastal impacts on people to sea level rise remains difﬁcult in 
most locations since impacts were exacerbated by human-induced non-climatic drivers, such as land subsidence 
(e.g., groundwater extraction), pollution, habitat degradation, reef and sand mining (high conﬁdence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3}
A.9.2  
 Coastal protection through hard measures, such as dikes, seawalls, and surge barriers, is 
widespread in many coastal cities and deltas. Ecosystem-based and hybrid approaches combining ecosystems and 
built infrastructure are becoming more popular worldwide. Coastal advance, which refers to the creation of new 
land by building seawards (e.g., land reclamation), has a long history in most areas where there are dense coastal

populations and a shortage of land. Coastal retreat, which refers to the removal of human occupation of coastal areas, 
is also observed, but is generally restricted to small human communities or occurs to create coastal wetland habitat.

Projected Changes and Risks
Projected Physical Changes25
B.1  
Global-scale glacier mass loss, permafrost thaw, and decline in snow cover and Arctic sea ice 
extent are projected to continue in the near-term (2031–2050) due to surface air temperature 
increases (high conﬁdence), with unavoidable consequences for river runoff and local hazards 
(high conﬁdence). The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are projected to lose mass at an 
increasing rate throughout the 21st century and beyond (high conﬁdence). The rates and 
magnitudes of these cryospheric changes are projected to increase further in the second half 
of the 21st century in a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (high conﬁdence). Strong 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades are projected to reduce further 
changes after 2050 (high conﬁdence). {2.2, 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2, 3.3, 3.4,

conﬁdence). Regions with mostly smaller glaciers (e.g., Central Europe, Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical 
Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), are projected to lose more than 80% of their current ice mass by 2100 
under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence), and many glaciers are projected to disappear regardless of future emissions 
(very high conﬁdence). {Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2, Figure SPM.1}
B.1.2  
 In 2100, the Greenland Ice Sheet’s projected contribution to GMSL rise is 0.07 m (0.04–0.12 m, 
likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.15 m (0.08–0.27 m, likely range) under RCP8.5. In 2100, the Antarctic Ice Sheet 
is projected to contribute 0.04 m (0.01–0.11 m, likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.12 m (0.03–0.28 m, likely range) 
under RCP8.5. The Greenland Ice Sheet is currently contributing more to sea level rise than the Antarctic Ice Sheet 
(high conﬁdence), but Antarctica could become a larger contributor by the end of the 21st century as a consequence 
of rapid retreat (low conﬁdence). Beyond 2100, increasing divergence between Greenland and Antarctica’s relative 
contributions to GMSL rise under RCP8.5 has important consequences for the pace of relative sea level rise in the 
Northern Hemisphere. {3.3.1, 4.2.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Figure SPM.1}
B.1.3  
 Arctic autumn and spring snow cover are projected to decrease by  5–10%, relative to 
1986–2005, in the near-term (2031–2050), followed by no further losses under RCP2.6, but an additional 15–25% 
loss by the end of century under RCP8.5 (high conﬁdence). In high mountain areas, projected decreases in low 
elevation mean winter snow depth, compared to 1986–2005, are likely 10–40% by 2031–2050, regardless of 
emissions scenario (high conﬁdence). For 2081–2100, this projected decrease is likely 10–40%  for RCP2.6 and 
50–90% for RCP8.5. {2.2.2, 3.3.2, 3.4.2, Figure SPM.1}

This report primarily uses RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for the following reasons: These scenarios largely represent the assessed range for the topics covered 
in this report; they largely represent what is covered in the assessed literature, based on CMIP5; and they allow a consistent narrative about projected 
changes. RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are not available for all topics addressed in the report. {Box SPM.1}

Summary for Policymakers
B.1.4  
 Widespread permafrost thaw is projected for this century (very high conﬁdence) and beyond. 
By 2100, projected near-surface (within 3–4 m) permafrost area shows a decrease of 24 ± 16% (likely range) for 
RCP2.6 and 69 ± 20% (likely range) for RCP8.5. The RCP8.5 scenario leads to the cumulative release of tens to 
hundreds of billions of tons (GtC) of permafrost carbon as CO226 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100 with 
the potential to exacerbate climate change (medium conﬁdence). Lower emissions scenarios dampen the response 
of carbon emissions from the permafrost region (high conﬁdence). Methane contributes a small fraction of the 
total additional carbon release but is signiﬁcant because of its higher warming potential. Increased plant growth is 
projected to replenish soil carbon in part, but will not match carbon releases over the long term (medium conﬁdence). 
{2.2.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, Figure SPM.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1}
B.1.5  
 In many high mountain areas, glacier retreat and permafrost thaw are projected to further 
decrease the stability of slopes, and the number and area of glacier lakes will continue to increase (high conﬁdence). 
Floods due to glacier lake outburst or rain-on-snow, landslides and snow avalanches, are projected to occur also in 
new locations or different seasons (high conﬁdence). {2.3.2}
B.1.6  
 River runoff in snow-dominated or glacier-fed high mountain basins is projected to change 
regardless of emissions scenario (very high conﬁdence), with increases in average winter runoff (high conﬁdence) 
and earlier spring peaks (very high conﬁdence). In all emissions scenarios, average annual and summer runoff from 
glaciers are projected to peak at or before the end of the 21st century (high conﬁdence), e.g., around mid-century in 
High Mountain Asia, followed by a decline in glacier runoff. In regions with little glacier cover (e.g., tropical Andes, 
European Alps) most glaciers have already passed this peak (high conﬁdence). Projected declines in glacier runoff by 
2100 (RCP8.5) can reduce basin runoff by 10% or more in at least one month of the melt season in several large river 
basins, especially in High Mountain Asia during the dry season (low conﬁdence). {2.3.1}
B.1.7  
 Arctic sea ice loss is projected to continue through mid-century, with differences thereafter 
depending on the magnitude of global warming: for stabilised global warming of 1.5ºC the annual probability of 
a sea ice-free September by the end of century is approximately 1%, which rises to 10–35% for stabilised global 
warming of 2ºC (high conﬁdence). There is low conﬁdence in projections for Antarctic sea ice. {3.2.2, Figure SPM.1}
B.2  
Over the 21st century, the ocean is projected to transition to unprecedented conditions with 
increased temperatures (virtually certain), greater upper ocean stratiﬁcation (very likely), 
further acidiﬁcation (virtually certain), oxygen decline (medium conﬁdence), and altered net 
primary production (low conﬁdence). Marine heatwaves (very high conﬁdence) and extreme 
El Niño and La Niña events (medium conﬁdence) are projected to become more frequent. The 
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken (very likely). The 
rates and magnitudes of these changes will be smaller under scenarios with low greenhouse 
gas emissions (very likely). {3.2, 5.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.7, Box 5.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.3}
B.2.1  
 The ocean will continue to warm throughout the 21st century (virtually certain). By 2100, 
the top 2000 m of the ocean are projected to take up 5–7 times more heat under RCP8.5 (or 2–4 times more 
under RCP2.6) than the observed accumulated ocean heat uptake since 1970 (very likely). The annual mean density 
stratiﬁcation19 of the top 200 m, averaged between 60ºS and 60ºN, is projected to increase by 12–30% for RCP8.5 
and 1–9% for RCP2.6, for 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 (very likely), inhibiting vertical nutrient, carbon and 
oxygen ﬂuxes. {5.2.2, Figure SPM.1}
26 
For context, total annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions were 10.8 ± 0.8 GtC yr–1 (39.6 ± 2.9 GtCO2 yr–1) on average over the period 2008–2017. 
Total annual anthropogenic methane emissions were 0.35 ± 0.01 GtCH4 yr–1, on average over the period 2003–2012. {5.5.1}

Summary for Policymakers
B.2.2  
 By 2081–2100 under RCP8.5, ocean oxygen content (medium conﬁdence), upper ocean nitrate 
content (medium conﬁdence), net primary production (low conﬁdence) and carbon export (medium conﬁdence) are 
projected to decline globally by very likely ranges of 3–4%, 9–14%, 4–11% and 9–16% respectively, relative to 
2006–2015. Under RCP2.6, globally projected changes by 2081–2100 are smaller compared to RCP8.5 for oxygen 
loss (very likely), nutrient availability (about as likely as not) and net primary production (high conﬁdence). {5.2.2, 
Box 5.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.3}
B.2.3  
 Continued carbon uptake by the ocean by 2100 is virtually certain to exacerbate ocean 
acidiﬁcation. Open ocean surface pH is projected to decrease by around 0.3 pH units by 2081–2100, relative to 
2006–2015, under RCP8.5 (virtually certain). For RCP8.5, there are elevated risks for keystone aragonite shell-forming 
species due to crossing an aragonite stability threshold year-round in the Polar and sub-Polar Oceans by 2081–2100 
(very likely). For RCP2.6, these conditions will be avoided this century (very likely), but some eastern boundary 
upwelling systems are projected to remain vulnerable (high conﬁdence). {3.2.3, 5.2.2, Box 5.1, Box 5.3, Figure SPM.1}
B.2.4  
 Climate conditions, unprecedented since the preindustrial period, are developing in the 
ocean, elevating risks for open ocean ecosystems. Surface acidiﬁcation and warming have already emerged in the 
historical period (very likely). Oxygen loss between 100 and 600 m depth is projected to emerge over 59–80% of 
the ocean area by 2031–2050 under RCP8.5 (very likely). The projected time of emergence for ﬁve primary drivers of 
marine ecosystem change (surface warming and acidiﬁcation, oxygen loss, nitrate content and net primary production 
change) are all prior to 2100 for over 60% of the ocean area under RCP8.5 and over 30% under RCP2.6 (very likely). 
{Annex I: Glossary, Box 5.1, Box 5.1 Figure 1}
B.2.5  
 Marine heatwaves are projected to further increase in frequency, duration, spatial extent 
and intensity (maximum temperature) (very high conﬁdence). Climate models project increases in the frequency of 
marine heatwaves by 2081–2100, relative to 1850–1900, by approximately 50 times under RCP8.5 and 20 times 
under RCP2.6 (medium conﬁdence). The largest increases in frequency are projected for the Arctic and the tropical 
oceans (medium conﬁdence). The intensity of marine heatwaves is projected to increase about 10-fold under RCP8.5 
by 2081–2100, relative to 1850–1900 (medium conﬁdence). {6.4, Figure SPM.1}
B.2.6  
 Extreme El Niño and La Niña events are projected to likely increase in frequency in the 21st 
century and to likely intensify existing hazards, with drier or wetter responses in several regions across the globe. 
Extreme El Niño events are projected to occur about as twice as often under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in the 21st 
century when compared to the 20th century (medium conﬁdence). Projections indicate that extreme Indian Ocean 
Dipole events also increase in frequency (low conﬁdence). {6.5, Figures 6.5, 6.6}
B.2.7  
 The AMOC is projected to weaken in the 21st century under all RCPs (very likely), although 
a collapse is very unlikely (medium conﬁdence). Based on CMIP5 projections, by 2300, an AMOC collapse is about 
as likely as not for high emissions scenarios and very unlikely for lower ones (medium conﬁdence). Any substantial 
weakening of the AMOC is projected to cause a decrease in marine productivity in the North Atlantic (medium 
conﬁdence), more storms in Northern Europe (medium conﬁdence), less Sahelian summer rainfall (high conﬁdence) 
and South Asian summer rainfall (medium conﬁdence), a reduced number of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic (medium 
conﬁdence), and an increase in regional sea level along the northeast coast of North America (medium conﬁdence). 
Such changes would be in addition to the global warming signal. {6.7, Figures 6.8–6.10}

Summary for Policymakers
B.3  
Sea level continues to rise at an increasing rate. Extreme sea level events that are historically 
rare (once per  century in the recent past) are projected to occur frequently (at least once 
per year) at many locations by 2050 in all RCP scenarios, especially in tropical regions (high 
conﬁdence). The increasing frequency of high water levels can have severe impacts in many 
locations depending on exposure (high conﬁdence). Sea level rise is projected to continue 
beyond 2100 in all RCP scenarios. For a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), projections of global 
sea level rise by 2100 are greater than in AR5 due to a larger contribution from the Antarctic 
Ice Sheet (medium conﬁdence). In coming centuries under RCP8.5, sea level rise is projected to 
exceed rates of several centimetres per year resulting in multi-metre rise (medium conﬁdence), 
while for RCP2.6 sea level rise is projected to be limited to around 1 m in 2300 (low conﬁdence). 
Extreme sea levels and coastal hazards will be exacerbated by projected increases in tropical 
cyclone intensity and precipitation (high conﬁdence). Projected changes in waves and tides 
vary locally in whether they amplify or ameliorate these hazards (medium conﬁdence). 
{Cross-Chapter Box 5  in Chapter  1, Cross-Chapter Box 8  in Chapter  3,  4.1,  4.2,  5.2.2,  6.3.1, 
Figures SPM.1, SPM.4, SPM.5}
B.3.1  
 The global mean sea level (GMSL) rise under RCP2.6 is projected to be 0.39 m (0.26–0.53 m, 
likely range) for the period 2081–2100, and 0.43 m (0.29–0.59 m, likely range) in 2100 with respect to 1986–2005. For 
RCP8.5, the corresponding GMSL rise is 0.71 m (0.51–0.92 m, likely range) for 2081–2100 and 0.84 m (0.61–1.10 m, 
likely range) in 2100. Mean sea level rise projections are higher by 0.1 m compared to AR5 under RCP8.5 in 2100, and 
the likely range extends beyond 1 m in 2100 due to a larger projected ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (medium 
conﬁdence). The uncertainty at the end of the century is mainly determined by the ice sheets, especially in Antarctica. 
{4.2.3, Figures SPM.1, SPM.5}
B.3.2  
 Sea level projections show regional differences around GMSL. Processes not driven by 
recent climate change, such as local subsidence caused by natural processes and human activities, are important to 
relative sea level changes at the coast (high conﬁdence). While the relative importance of climate-driven sea level 
rise is projected to increase over time, local processes need to be considered for projections and impacts of sea level 
(high conﬁdence). {SPM A.3.4, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, Figure SPM.5}
B.3.3  
 The rate of global mean sea level rise is projected to reach 15 mm yr–1 (10–20 mm yr–1, likely 
range) under RCP8.5 in 2100, and to exceed several centimetres per year in the 22nd century. Under RCP2.6, the rate 
is projected to reach 4 mm yr-1 (2–6 mm yr–1, likely range) in 2100. Model studies indicate multi-meter rise in sea 
level by 2300 (2.3–5.4 m for RCP8.5 and 0.6–1.07 m under RCP2.6) (low conﬁdence), indicating the importance of 
reduced emissions for limiting sea level rise. Processes controlling the timing of future ice-shelf loss and the extent of 
ice sheet instabilities could increase Antarctica’s contribution to sea level rise to values substantially higher than the 
likely range on century and longer time-scales (low conﬁdence). Considering the consequences of sea level rise that 
a collapse of parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet entails, this high impact risk merits attention. {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in 
Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.1, 4.2.3}
B.3.4  
 Global mean sea level rise will cause the frequency of extreme sea level events at most 
locations to increase. Local sea levels that historically occurred once per century (historical centennial events) are 
projected to occur at least annually at most locations by 2100 under all RCP scenarios (high conﬁdence). Many 
low-lying megacities and small islands (including SIDS) are projected to experience historical centennial events at 
least annually by 2050 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The year when the historical centennial event becomes 
an annual event in the mid-latitudes occurs soonest in RCP8.5, next in RCP4.5 and latest in RCP2.6. The increasing 
frequency of high water levels can have severe impacts in many locations depending on the level of exposure (high 
conﬁdence). {4.2.3, 6.3, Figures SPM.4, SPM.5}

Summary for Policymakers
B.3.5  
 Signiﬁcant wave heights (the average height from trough to crest of the highest one-third 
of waves) are projected to increase across the Southern Ocean and tropical eastern Paciﬁc (high conﬁdence) and 
Baltic Sea (medium conﬁdence) and decrease over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea under RCP8.5 (high 
conﬁdence). Coastal tidal amplitudes and patterns are projected to change due to sea level rise and coastal adaptation 
measures (very likely). Projected changes in waves arising from changes in weather patterns, and changes in tides 
due to sea level rise, can locally enhance or ameliorate coastal hazards (medium conﬁdence). {6.3.1, 5.2.2}
B.3.6  
 The average intensity of tropical cyclones, the proportion of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones 
and the associated average precipitation rates are projected to increase for a 2ºC global temperature rise above any 
baseline period (medium conﬁdence). Rising mean sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated 
with tropical cyclones (very high conﬁdence). Coastal hazards will be exacerbated by an increase in the average 
intensity, magnitude of storm surge and precipitation rates of tropical cyclones. There are greater increases projected 
under RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6 from around mid-century to 2100 (medium conﬁdence). There is low conﬁdence in 
changes in the future frequency of tropical cyclones at the global scale. {6.3.1}
Projected Risks for Ecosystems
B.4  
Future land cryosphere changes will continue to alter terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in 
high mountain and polar regions with major shifts in species distributions resulting in changes 
in ecosystem structure and functioning, and eventual loss of globally unique biodiversity 
(medium conﬁdence). Wildﬁre is projected to increase signiﬁcantly for the rest of this 
century across most tundra and boreal regions, and also in some mountain regions (medium 
conﬁdence). {2.3.3, Box 3.4, 3.4.3}
B.4.1  
 In high mountain regions, further upslope migration by lower-elevation species, range 
contractions, and increased mortality will lead to population declines of many alpine species, especially glacier- or 
snow-dependent species (high conﬁdence), with local and eventual global species loss (medium conﬁdence). The 
persistence of alpine species and sustaining ecosystem services depends on appropriate conservation and adaptation 
measures (high conﬁdence). {2.3.3}
B.4.2  
 On Arctic land, a loss of globally unique biodiversity is projected as limited refugia exist for 
some High-Arctic species and hence they are outcompeted by more temperate species (medium conﬁdence). Woody 
shrubs and trees are projected to expand to cover 24–52% of Arctic tundra by 2050 (medium conﬁdence). The boreal 
forest is projected to expand at its northern edge, while diminishing at its southern edge where it is replaced by lower 
biomass woodland/shrublands (medium conﬁdence). {3.4.3, Box 3.4}
B.4.3  
 Permafrost thaw and decrease in snow will affect Arctic and mountain hydrology and wildﬁre, 
with impacts on vegetation and wildlife (medium conﬁdence). About 20% of Arctic land permafrost is vulnerable to 
abrupt permafrost thaw and ground subsidence, which is projected to increase small lake area by over 50% by 2100 
for RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). Even as the overall regional water cycle is projected to intensify, including increased 
precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge to the Arctic Ocean, decreases in snow and permafrost may 
lead to soil drying with consequences for ecosystem productivity and disturbances (medium conﬁdence). Wildﬁre is 
projected to increase for the rest of this century across most tundra and boreal regions, and also in some mountain 
regions, while interactions between climate and shifting vegetation will inﬂuence future ﬁre intensity and frequency 
(medium conﬁdence). {2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, SPM B.1}

Summary for Policymakers
B.5  
A decrease in global biomass of marine animal communities, their production, and ﬁsheries 
catch potential, and a  shift in species composition are projected over the 21st century in 
ocean ecosystems from the surface to the deep seaﬂoor under all emission scenarios (medium 
conﬁdence). The rate and magnitude of decline are projected to be highest in the tropics 
(high conﬁdence), whereas impacts remain diverse in polar regions (medium conﬁdence) and 
increase for high emissions scenarios. Ocean acidiﬁcation (medium conﬁdence), oxygen loss 
(medium conﬁdence) and reduced sea ice extent (medium conﬁdence) as well as non-climatic 
human activities (medium conﬁdence) have the potential to exacerbate these warming-induced 
ecosystem impacts. {3.2.3, 3.3.3, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
B.5.1  
 Projected ocean warming and changes in net primary production alter biomass, production 
and community structure of marine ecosystems. The global-scale biomass of marine animals across the foodweb is 
projected to decrease by 15.0 ± 5.9% (very likely range) and the maximum catch potential of ﬁsheries by 20.5–24.1% 
by the end of the 21st century relative to 1986–2005 under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). These changes are projected 
to be very likely three to four times larger under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6. {3.2.3, 3.3.3, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
B.5.2  
 Under enhanced stratiﬁcation reduced nutrient supply is projected to cause tropical ocean 
net primary production to decline by 7–16% (very likely range) for RCP8.5 by 2081–2100 (medium conﬁdence). In 
tropical regions, marine animal biomass and production are projected to decrease more than the global average 
under all emissions scenarios in the 21st century (high conﬁdence). Warming and sea ice changes are projected to 
increase marine net primary production in the Arctic (medium conﬁdence) and around Antarctica (low conﬁdence), 
modiﬁed by changing nutrient supply due to shifts in upwelling and stratiﬁcation. Globally, the sinking ﬂux of organic 
matter from the upper ocean is projected to decrease, linked largely due to changes in net primary production 
(high conﬁdence). As a result, 95% or more of the deep sea (3000–6000 m depth) seaﬂoor area and cold-water 
coral ecosystems are projected to experience declines in benthic biomass under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). 
{3.2.3, 5.2.2. 5.2.4, Figure SPM.1}
B.5.3  
 Warming, ocean acidiﬁcation, reduced seasonal sea ice extent and continued loss of 
multi-year sea ice are projected to impact polar marine ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on habitats, 
populations and their viability (medium conﬁdence). The geographical range of Arctic marine species, including 
marine mammals, birds and ﬁsh is projected to contract, while the range of some sub-Arctic ﬁsh communities is 
projected to expand, further increasing pressure on high-Arctic species (medium conﬁdence). In the Southern Ocean, 
the habitat of Antarctic krill, a key prey species for penguins, seals and whales, is projected to contract southwards 
under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). {3.2.2, 3.2.3, 5.2.3}
B.5.4  
 Ocean warming, oxygen loss, acidiﬁcation and a decrease in ﬂux of organic carbon from the 
surface to the deep ocean are projected to harm habitat-forming cold-water corals, which support high biodiversity, 
partly through decreased calciﬁcation, increased dissolution of skeletons, and bioerosion (medium conﬁdence). 
Vulnerability and risks are highest where and when temperature and oxygen conditions both reach values outside 
species’ tolerance ranges (medium conﬁdence). {Box 5.2, Figure SPM.3}

global average. (c) *Average observed ﬁsheries catch in the recent past (based on data from the Sea Around Us global ﬁsheries database); projected 
changes in maximum ﬁsheries catch potential in shelf seas are based on the average outputs from two ﬁsheries and marine ecosystem models. To 
indicate areas of model inconsistency, shaded areas represent regions where models disagree in the direction of change for more than: (a) and (b) 
3 out of 10 model projections, and (c) one out of two models. Although unshaded, the projected change in the Arctic and Antarctic regions in (b) total 
animal biomass and (c) ﬁsheries catch potential have low conﬁdence due to uncertainties associated with modelling multiple interacting drivers and 
ecosystem responses. Projections presented in (b) and (c) are driven by changes in ocean physical and biogeochemical conditions e.g., temperature, 
oxygen level, and net primary production projected from CMIP5 Earth system models. **The epipelagic refers to the uppermost part of the ocean

on global mean Sea Surface Temperature (SST), the corresponding SST levels are shown29. The assessment of risk transitions is described in Chapter 
5 Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.2.5 and 5.3.7 and Supplementary Materials SM5.3, Table SM5.6, Table SM5.8 and other parts of the underlying report. The 
ﬁgure indicates assessed risks at approximate warming levels and increasing climate-related hazards in the ocean: ocean warming, acidiﬁcation, 
deoxygenation, increased density stratiﬁcation, changes in carbon ﬂuxes, sea level rise, and increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme events. 
The assessment considers the natural adaptive capacity of the ecosystems, their exposure and vulnerability. Impact and risk levels do not consider 
risk reduction strategies such as human interventions, or future changes in non-climatic drivers. Risks for ecosystems were assessed by considering 
biological, biogeochemical, geomorphological and physical aspects. Higher risks associated with compound effects of climate hazards include 
habitat and biodiversity loss, changes in species composition and distribution ranges, and impacts/risks on ecosystem structure and functioning, 
including changes in animal/plant biomass and density, productivity, carbon ﬂuxes, and sediment transport. As part of the assessment, literature was 
compiled and data extracted into a summary table. A multi-round expert elicitation process was undertaken with independent evaluation of threshold 
judgement, and a ﬁnal consensus discussion. Further information on methods and underlying literature can be found in Chapter 5, Sections 5.2 
and 5.3 and Supplementary Material. {3.2.3, 3.2.4, 5.2, 5.3, 5.2.5, 5.3.7, SM5.6, SM5.8, Figure 5.16, Cross Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1 Table CCB1}

NPP is estimated from the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5).

Total animal biomass is from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Models Intercomparison Project (FISHMIP).

The conversion between GMST and SST is based on a scaling factor of 1.44 derived from changes in an ensemble of RCP8.5 simulations; this scaling 
factor has an uncertainty of about 4% due to differences between the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. {Table SPM.1}
B.6  
Risks of severe impacts on biodiversity, structure and function of coastal ecosystems are 
projected to be higher for elevated temperatures under high compared to low emissions 
scenarios in the 21st century and beyond. Projected ecosystem responses include losses 
of species habitat and diversity, and degradation of ecosystem functions. The capacity of 
organisms and ecosystems to adjust and adapt is higher at lower emissions scenarios (high 
conﬁdence). For sensitive ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and kelp forests, high risks 
are projected if global warming exceeds 2ºC above pre-industrial temperature, combined with 
other climate-related hazards (high conﬁdence). Warm-water corals are at high risk already 
and are projected to transition to very high risk even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC 
(very high conﬁdence). {4.3.3, 5.3, 5.5, Figure SPM.3}
B.6.1  
 All coastal ecosystems assessed are projected to face increasing risk level, from moderate to 
high risk under RCP2.6 to high to very high risk under RCP8.5 by 2100. Intertidal rocky shore ecosystems are projected 
to be at very high risk by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence) due to exposure to warming, especially during 
marine heatwaves, as well as to acidiﬁcation, sea level rise, loss of calcifying species and biodiversity (high conﬁdence). 
Ocean acidiﬁcation challenges these ecosystems and further limits their habitat suitability (medium conﬁdence) by 
inhibiting recovery through reduced calciﬁcation and enhanced bioerosion. The decline of kelp forests is projected to 
continue in temperate regions due to warming, particularly under the projected intensiﬁcation of marine heatwaves, 
with high risk of local extinctions under RCP8.5 (medium conﬁdence). {5.3, 5.3.5, 5.3.6, 5.3.7, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.3}
B.6.2  
 Seagrass meadows and saltmarshes and associated carbon stores are at moderate risk 
at 1.5ºC global warming and increase with further warming (medium conﬁdence). Globally, 20–90% of current coastal 
wetlands are projected to be lost by 2100, depending on projected sea level rise, regional differences and wetland  
types, especially where vertical growth is already constrained by reduced sediment supply and landward migration is 
constrained by steep topography or human modiﬁcation of shorelines (high conﬁdence). {4.3.3, 5.3.2, Figure SPM.3,

Summary for Policymakers
B.6.3  
 Ocean warming, sea level rise and tidal changes are projected to expand salinization and 
hypoxia in estuaries (high conﬁdence) with high risks for some biota leading to migration, reduced survival, and local 
extinction under high emission scenarios (medium conﬁdence). These impacts are projected to be more pronounced 
in more vulnerable eutrophic and shallow estuaries with low tidal range in temperate and high latitude regions 
(medium conﬁdence). {5.2.2, 5.3.1, Figure SPM.3}
B.6.4  
 Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer signiﬁcant losses of area and 
local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (high conﬁdence). The species composition and diversity 
of remaining reef communities is projected to differ from present-day reefs (very high conﬁdence). {5.3.4,  5.4.1, 
Figure SPM.3}
Projected Risks for People and Ecosystem Services
B.7  
Future cryosphere changes on land are projected to affect water resources and their uses, such 
as hydropower (high conﬁdence) and irrigated agriculture in and downstream of high mountain 
areas (medium conﬁdence), as well as livelihoods in the Arctic (medium conﬁdence). Changes 
in ﬂoods, avalanches, landslides, and ground destabilization are projected to increase risk for 
infrastructure, cultural, tourism, and recreational assets (medium conﬁdence). {2.3, 2.3.1, 3.4.3}
B.7.1  
 Disaster risks to human settlements and livelihood options in high mountain areas and 
the Arctic are expected to increase (medium conﬁdence), due to future changes in hazards such as ﬂoods, ﬁres, 
landslides, avalanches, unreliable ice and snow conditions, and increased exposure of people and infrastructure (high 
conﬁdence). Current engineered risk reduction approaches are projected to be less effective as hazards change in 
character (medium conﬁdence). Signiﬁcant risk reduction and adaptation strategies help avoid increased impacts 
from mountain ﬂood and landslide hazards as exposure and vulnerability are increasing in many mountain regions 
during this century (high conﬁdence). {2.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2}
B.7.2  
 Permafrost thaw-induced subsidence of the land surface is projected to impact overlying 
urban and rural communication and transportation infrastructure in the Arctic and in high mountain areas (medium 
conﬁdence). The majority of Arctic infrastructure is located in regions where permafrost thaw is projected to intensify 
by mid-century. Retroﬁtting and redesigning infrastructure has the potential to halve the costs arising from permafrost 
thaw and related climate-change impacts by 2100 (medium conﬁdence). {2.3.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.3}
B.7.3  
 High mountain tourism, recreation and cultural assets are projected to be negatively affected 
by future cryospheric changes (high conﬁdence). Current snowmaking technologies are projected to be less effective 
in reducing risks to ski tourism in a warmer climate in most parts of Europe, North America, and Japan, in particular 
at 2ºC global warming and beyond (high conﬁdence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}

Summary for Policymakers
B.8  
Future shifts in ﬁsh distribution and decreases in their abundance and ﬁsheries catch potential 
due to climate change are projected to affect income, livelihoods, and food security of marine 
resource-dependent communities (medium conﬁdence). Long-term loss and degradation of 
marine ecosystems compromises the ocean’s role in cultural, recreational, and intrinsic values 
important for human identity and well-being (medium conﬁdence). {3.2.4, 3.4.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 6.4}
B.8.1  
 Projected geographical shifts and decreases of global marine animal biomass and ﬁsh catch 
potential are more pronounced under RCP8.5 relative to RCP2.6 elevating the risk for income and livelihoods of 
dependent human communities, particularly in areas that are economically vulnerable (medium conﬁdence). The 
projected redistribution of resources and abundance increases the risk of conﬂicts among ﬁsheries, authorities or 
communities (medium conﬁdence). Challenges to ﬁsheries governance are widespread under RCP8.5 with regional 
hotspots such as the Arctic and tropical Paciﬁc Ocean (medium conﬁdence). {3.5.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.4.2, 
Figure SPM.3}
B.8.2  
 The decline in warm-water coral reefs is projected to greatly compromise the services they 
provide to society, such as food provision (high conﬁdence), coastal protection (high conﬁdence) and tourism 
(medium conﬁdence). Increases in the risks for seafood security (medium conﬁdence) associated with decreases in 
seafood availability are projected to elevate the risk to nutritional health in some communities highly dependent 
on seafood (medium conﬁdence), such as those in the Arctic, West Africa, and Small Island Developing States. Such 
impacts compound any risks from other shifts in diets and food systems caused by social and economic changes and 
climate change over land (medium conﬁdence). {3.4.3, 5.4.2, 6.4.2}
B.8.3  
 Global warming compromises seafood safety (medium conﬁdence) through human 
exposure to elevated bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants and mercury in marine plants and animals 
(medium conﬁdence), increasing prevalence of waterborne Vibrio pathogens (medium conﬁdence), and heightened 
likelihood of harmful algal blooms (medium conﬁdence). These risks are projected to be particularly large for human 
communities with high consumption of seafood, including coastal Indigenous communities (medium conﬁdence), 
and for economic sectors such as ﬁsheries, aquaculture, and tourism (high conﬁdence). {3.4.3, 5.4.2, Box 5.3}
B.8.4  
 Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and their services put key cultural dimensions 
of lives and livelihoods at risk (medium conﬁdence), including through shifts in the distribution or abundance of 
harvested species and diminished access to ﬁshing or hunting areas. This includes potentially rapid and irreversible 
loss of culture and local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge, and negative impacts on traditional diets and food 
security, aesthetic aspects, and marine recreational activities (medium conﬁdence). {3.4.3, 3.5.3, 5.4.2}

Summary for Policymakers
B.9  
Increased mean and extreme sea level, alongside ocean warming and acidiﬁcation, are projected 
to exacerbate risks for human communities in low-lying coastal areas (high conﬁdence). In Arctic 
human communities without rapid land uplift, and in urban atoll islands, risks are projected 
to be moderate to high even under a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) (medium conﬁdence), 
including reaching adaptation limits (high conﬁdence). Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), 
delta regions and resource rich coastal cities are projected to experience moderate to high 
risk levels after 2050 under current adaptation (medium conﬁdence). Ambitious adaptation 
including transformative governance is expected to reduce risk (high conﬁdence), but with 
context-speciﬁc beneﬁts. {4.3.3, 4.3.4, SM4.3, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
B.9.1 
 In the absence of more ambitious adaptation efforts compared to today, and under current 
trends of increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities, risks, such as erosion and land loss, ﬂooding, 
salinization, and cascading impacts due to mean sea level rise and extreme events are projected to signiﬁcantly 
increase throughout this century under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (very high conﬁdence). Under the 
same assumptions, annual coastal ﬂood damages are projected to increase by 2–3 orders of magnitude by 2100 
compared to today (high conﬁdence). {4.3.3, 4.3.4, Box 6.1, 6.8, SM.4.3, Figures SPM.4, SPM.5}
B.9.2  
 High to very high risks are approached for vulnerable communities in coral reef environments, 
urban atoll islands and low-lying Arctic locations from sea level rise well before the end of this century in case of high 
emissions scenarios. This entails adaptation limits being reached, which are the points at which an actor’s objectives 
(or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions (high conﬁdence). Reaching 
adaptation limits (e.g., biophysical, geographical, ﬁnancial, technical, social, political, and institutional) depends on the 
emissions scenario and context-speciﬁc risk tolerance, and is projected to expand to more areas beyond 2100, due to the 
long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium conﬁdence). Some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable 
due to climate-related ocean and cryosphere change (medium conﬁdence), but habitability thresholds remain extremely 
difﬁcult to assess. {4.3.4, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 5.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SM.4.3, SPM C.1, Glossary, Figure SPM.5}
B.9.3  
 Globally, a slower rate of climate-related ocean and cryosphere change provides greater 
adaptation opportunities (high conﬁdence). While there is high conﬁdence that ambitious adaptation, including 
governance for transformative change, has the potential to reduce risks in many locations, such beneﬁts can vary 
between locations. At global scale, coastal protection can reduce ﬂood risk by 2–3 orders of magnitude during 
the 21st century, but depends on investments on the order of tens to several hundreds of billions of US$ per year 
(high conﬁdence). While such investments are generally cost efﬁcient for densely populated urban areas, rural and 
poorer areas may be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual costs for some small island states 
amounting to several percent of GDP (high conﬁdence). Even with major adaptation efforts, residual risks and 
associated losses are projected to occur (medium conﬁdence), but context-speciﬁc limits to adaptation and residual 
risks remain difﬁcult to assess. {4.1.3, 4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.4., 4.4.3, 6.9.1, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1–2 in

Due to projected global mean sea level (GMSL) rise, local sea levels that historically occurred once per century 
(historical centennial events, HCEs) are projected to become at least annual events at most locations during the 
21st century. The height of a HCE varies widely, and depending on the level of exposure can already cause severe 
impacts. Impacts can continue to increase with rising frequency of HCEs.

 Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere Change 
Challenges
C.1  
Impacts of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere increasingly challenge current 
governance efforts to develop and implement adaptation responses from local to global 
scales, and in some cases pushing them to their limits. People with the highest exposure 
and vulnerability are often those with lowest capacity to respond (high conﬁdence). {1.5, 1.7, 
Cross-Chapter Boxes 2–3 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 2.4, 3.2.4, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 4.1, 4.3.3, 
4.4.3, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}
C.1.1  
 The temporal scales of climate change impacts in ocean and cryosphere and their societal 
consequences operate on time horizons which are longer than those of governance arrangements (e.g., planning cycles, 
public and corporate decision making cycles, and ﬁnancial instruments). Such temporal differences challenge the ability 
of societies to adequately prepare for and respond to long-term changes including shifts in the frequency and intensity 
of extreme events (high conﬁdence). Examples include changing landslides and ﬂoods in high mountain regions and 
risks to important species and ecosystems in the Arctic, as well as to low-lying nations and islands, small island nations, 
other coastal regions and to coral reef ecosystems. {2.3.2, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}
C.1.2  
 Governance arrangements (e.g., marine protected areas, spatial plans and water management 
systems) are, in many contexts, too fragmented across administrative boundaries and sectors to provide integrated 
responses to the increasing and cascading risks from climate-related changes in the ocean and/or cryosphere (high 
conﬁdence). The capacity of governance systems in polar and ocean regions to respond to climate change impacts 
has strengthened recently, but this development is not sufﬁciently rapid or robust to adequately address the scale 
of increasing projected risks (high conﬁdence). In high mountains, coastal regions and small islands, there are also 
difﬁculties in coordinating climate adaptation responses, due to the many interactions of climatic and non-climatic 
risk drivers (such as inaccessibility, demographic and settlement trends, or land subsidence caused by local activities) 
across scales, sectors and policy domains (high conﬁdence). {2.3.1, 3.5.3, 4.4.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, Box 5.6, 6.9, 
Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1}
C.1.3  
 There are a broad range of identiﬁed barriers and limits for adaptation to climate change 
in ecosystems (high conﬁdence). Limitations include the space that ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and 
human impacts that need to be addressed as part of the adaptation response, the lowering of adaptive capacity 
of ecosystems because of climate change, and the slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the recurrence of 
climate impacts, availability of technology, knowledge and ﬁnancial support, and existing governance arrangements 
(medium conﬁdence). {3.5.4, 5.5.2} 
C.1.4  
 Financial, technological, institutional and other barriers exist for implementing responses to 
current and projected negative impacts of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere, impeding resilience 
building and risk reduction measures (high conﬁdence). Whether such barriers reduce adaptation effectiveness or 
correspond to adaptation limits depends on context speciﬁc circumstances, the rate and scale of climate changes 
and on the ability of societies to turn their adaptive capacity into effective adaptation responses. Adaptive capacity 
continues to differ between as well as within communities and societies (high conﬁdence). People with highest 
exposure and vulnerability to current and future hazards from ocean and cryosphere changes are often also those 
with lowest adaptive capacity, particularly in low-lying islands and coasts, Arctic and high mountain regions with 
development challenges (high conﬁdence). {2.3.1,  2.3.2,  2.3.7, Box  2.4,  3.5.2,  4.3.4,  4.4.2,  4.4.3,  5.5.2,  6.9,

Summary for Policymakers
Strengthening Response Options
C.2  
The far-reaching services and options provided by ocean and cryosphere-related ecosystems 
can be supported by protection, restoration, precautionary ecosystem-based management 
of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other stressors (high 
conﬁdence). Integrated water management (medium conﬁdence) and ecosystem-based 
adaptation (high conﬁdence) approaches lower climate risks locally and provide 
multiple societal beneﬁts. However, ecological, ﬁnancial, institutional and governance 
constraints for such actions exist (high conﬁdence), and in many contexts ecosystem-based 
adaptation will only be effective under the lowest levels of warming (high conﬁdence). 
{2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.2.4, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.2, 5.2.2, 5.4.2, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Figure SPM.5}
C.2.1  
 Networks of protected areas help maintain ecosystem services, including carbon uptake 
and storage, and enable future ecosystem-based adaptation options by facilitating the poleward and altitudinal 
movements of species, populations, and ecosystems that occur in response to warming and sea level rise (medium 
conﬁdence). Geographic barriers, ecosystem degradation, habitat fragmentation and barriers to regional cooperation 
limit the potential for such networks to support future species range shifts in marine, high mountain and polar land 
regions (high conﬁdence). {2.3.3, 3.2.3, 3.3.2, 3.5.4, 5.5.2, Box 3.4}
C.2.2  
 Terrestrial and marine habitat restoration, and ecosystem management tools such as assisted 
species relocation and coral gardening, can be locally effective in enhancing ecosystem-based adaptation (high 
conﬁdence). Such actions are most successful when they are community-supported, are science-based whilst also 
using local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge, have long-term support that includes the reduction or removal of 
non-climatic stressors, and under the lowest levels of warming (high conﬁdence). For example, coral reef restoration 
options may be ineffective if global warming exceeds 1.5ºC, because corals are already at high risk (very high 
conﬁdence) at current levels of warming. {2.3.3, 4.4.2, 5.3.7, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Box 5.5, Figure SPM.3}
C.2.3  
 Strengthening precautionary approaches, such as rebuilding overexploited or depleted 
ﬁsheries, and responsiveness of existing ﬁsheries management strategies reduces negative climate change impacts 
on ﬁsheries, with beneﬁts for regional economies and livelihoods (medium conﬁdence). Fisheries management that 
regularly assesses and updates measures over time, informed by assessments of future ecosystem trends, reduces risks 
for ﬁsheries (medium conﬁdence) but has limited ability to address ecosystem change. {3.2.4, 3.5.2, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 
Figure SPM.5}
C.2.4  
 Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass 
meadows (coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems), could provide climate change mitigation through increased carbon 
uptake and storage of around 0.5% of current global emissions annually (medium conﬁdence). Improved protection 
and management can reduce carbon emissions from these ecosystems. Together, these actions also have multiple 
other beneﬁts, such as providing storm protection, improving water quality, and beneﬁting biodiversity and ﬁsheries 
(high conﬁdence). Improving the quantiﬁcation of carbon storage and greenhouse gas ﬂuxes of these coastal 
ecosystems will reduce current uncertainties around measurement, reporting and veriﬁcation (high conﬁdence).

 Ocean renewable energy can support climate change mitigation, and can comprise energy 
extraction from offshore winds, tides, waves, thermal and salinity gradient and algal biofuels. The emerging demand 
for alternative energy sources is expected to generate economic opportunities for the ocean renewable energy sector 
(high conﬁdence), although their potential may also be affected by climate change (low conﬁdence). {5.4.2, 5.5.1,

Summary for Policymakers
C.2.6  
 Integrated water management approaches across multiple scales can be effective at 
addressing impacts and leveraging opportunities from cryosphere changes in high mountain areas. These approaches 
also support water resource management through the development and optimization of multi-purpose storage 
and release of water from reservoirs (medium conﬁdence), with consideration of potentially negative impacts to 
ecosystems and communities. Diversiﬁcation of tourism activities throughout the year supports adaptation in high 
mountain economies (medium conﬁdence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5}
C.3  
Coastal communities face challenging choices in crafting context-speciﬁc and integrated 
responses to sea level rise that balance costs, beneﬁts and trade-offs of available options 
and that can be adjusted over time (high conﬁdence). All types of options, including 
protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal advance and retreat, 
wherever possible, can play important roles in such integrated responses (high conﬁdence). 
{4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.3.1  
 The higher the sea levels rise, the more challenging is coastal protection, mainly due to 
economic, ﬁnancial and social barriers rather than due to technical limits (high conﬁdence). In the coming decades, 
reducing local drivers of exposure and vulnerability such as coastal urbanization and human-induced subsidence 
constitute effective responses (high conﬁdence). Where space is limited, and the value of exposed assets is high 
(e.g., in cities), hard protection (e.g., dikes) is likely to be a cost-efﬁcient response option during the 21st century 
taking into account the speciﬁcs of the context (high conﬁdence), but resource-limited areas may not be able to 
afford such investments. Where space is available, ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce coastal risk and provide 
multiple other beneﬁts such as carbon storage, improved water quality, biodiversity conservation and livelihood 
support (medium conﬁdence). {4.3.2, 4.4.2, Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.3.2  
 Some coastal accommodation measures, such as early warning systems and ﬂood-prooﬁng of 
buildings, are often both low cost and highly cost-efﬁcient under current sea levels (high conﬁdence). Under projected 
sea level rise and increase in coastal hazards some of these measures become less effective unless combined with 
other measures (high conﬁdence). All types of options, including protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based 
adaptation, coastal advance and planned relocation, if alternative localities are available, can play important roles in 
such integrated responses (high conﬁdence). Where the community affected is small, or in the aftermath of a disaster, 
reducing risk by coastal planned relocations is worth considering if safe alternative localities are available. Such 
planned relocation can be socially, culturally, ﬁnancially and politically constrained (very high conﬁdence). {4.4.2, 
Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SPM B.3}
C.3.3  
 Responses to sea level rise and associated risk reduction present society with profound 
governance challenges, resulting from the uncertainty about the magnitude and rate of future sea level rise, vexing 
trade-offs between societal goals (e.g., safety, conservation, economic development, intra- and inter-generational 
equity), limited resources, and conﬂicting interests and values among diverse stakeholders (high conﬁdence). 
These challenges can be eased using locally appropriate combinations of decision analysis, land-use planning, 
public participation, diverse knowledge systems and conﬂict resolution approaches that are adjusted over time as 
circumstances change (high conﬁdence). {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9}
C.3.4  
 Despite the large uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of post 2050 sea level rise, many 
coastal decisions with time horizons of decades to over a century are being made now (e.g., critical infrastructure, 
coastal protection works, city planning) and can be improved by taking relative sea level rise into account, favouring 
ﬂexible responses (i.e., those that can be adapted over time) supported by monitoring systems for early warning 
signals, periodically adjusting decisions (i.e., adaptive decision making), using robust decision-making approaches, 
expert judgement, scenario-building, and multiple knowledge systems (high conﬁdence). The sea level rise range 
that needs to be considered for planning and implementing coastal responses depends on the risk tolerance of

stakeholders. Stakeholders with higher risk tolerance (e.g., those planning for investments that can be very easily 
adapted to unforeseen conditions) often prefer to use the likely range of projections, while stakeholders with a lower 
risk tolerance (e.g., those deciding on critical infrastructure) also consider global and local mean sea level above 
the upper end of the likely range (globally 1.1 m under RCP8.5 by 2100) and from methods characterised by lower 
conﬁdence such as from expert elicitation. {1.8.1, 1.9.2, 4.2.3, 4.4.4, Figure 4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1,

In this assessment, the term response refers to in situ responses to sea level rise (hard engineered coastal defenses, restoration of degraded ecosystems, 
subsidence limitation) and planned relocation. Planned relocation in this assessment refers to proactive managed retreat or resettlement only at a local scale, and 
according to the speciﬁcities of a particular context (e.g., in urban atoll islands: within the island, in a neighbouring island or in artiﬁcially raised islands). Forced 
displacement and international migration are not considered in this assessment.
The illustrative geographies are based on a limited number of case studies well covered by the peer reviewed literature. The realisation of risk will depend on 
context speciﬁties.
Sea level rise scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are not considered in this risk assessment because the literature underpinning this assessment is only available for 
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.

Summary for Policymakers
Figure SPM.5 |  Sea level rise risks and responses. The term response is used here instead of adaptation because some responses, such as retreat, 
may or may not be considered to be adaptation. (a) shows the combined risk of coastal ﬂooding, erosion and salinization for illustrative geographies 
in 2100, due to changing mean and extreme sea levels under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 and under two response scenarios. Risks under RCPs 4.5 and 6.0 
were not assessed due to a lack of literature for the assessed geographies. The assessment does not account for changes in extreme sea level beyond 
those directly induced by mean sea level rise; risk levels could increase if other changes in extreme sea levels were considered (e.g., due to changes 
in cyclone intensity). Panel a) considers a socioeconomic scenario with relatively stable coastal population density over the century. {SM4.3.2} Risks to 
illustrative geographies have been assessed based on relative sea level changes projected for a set of speciﬁc examples: New York City, Shanghai and 
Rotterdam for resource-rich coastal cities covering a wide range of response experiences; South Tarawa, Fongafale and Male’ for urban atoll islands; 
Mekong and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna for large tropical agricultural deltas; and Bykovskiy, Shishmaref, Kivalina, Tuktoyaktuk and Shingle Point 
for Arctic communities located in regions remote from rapid glacio-isostatic adjustment. {4.2, 4.3.4, SM4.2} The assessment distinguishes between 
two contrasting response scenarios. “No-to-moderate response” describes efforts as of today (i.e., no further signiﬁcant action or new types of 
actions). “Maximum potential response” represents a combination of responses implemented to their full extent and thus signiﬁcant additional efforts 
compared to today, assuming minimal ﬁnancial, social and political barriers. The assessment has been conducted for each sea level rise and response 
scenario, as indicated by the burning embers in the ﬁgure; in-between risk levels are interpolated. {4.3.3} The assessment criteria include exposure 
and vulnerability (density of assets, level of degradation of terrestrial and marine buffer ecosystems), coastal hazards (ﬂooding, shoreline erosion, 
salinization), in-situ responses (hard engineered coastal defenses, ecosystem restoration or creation of new natural buffers areas, and subsidence 
management) and planned relocation. Planned relocation refers to managed retreat or resettlement as described in Chapter 4, i.e., proactive and 
local-scale measures to reduce risk by relocating people, assets and infrastructure. Forced displacement is not considered in this assessment. Panel (a) 
also highlights the relative contributions of in-situ responses and planned relocation to the total risk reduction. (b) schematically illustrates the risk 
reduction (vertical arrows) and risk delay (horizontal arrows) through mitigation and/or responses to sea level rise. (c) summarizes and assesses 
responses to sea level rise in terms of their effectiveness, costs, co-beneﬁts, drawbacks, economic efﬁciency and associated governance challenges.

Enabling Conditions
C.4  
Enabling climate resilience and sustainable development depends critically on urgent 
and ambitious emissions reductions coupled with coordinated sustained and increasingly 
ambitious adaptation actions (very high conﬁdence). Key enablers for implementing effective 
responses to climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere include intensifying 
cooperation and coordination among governing authorities across spatial scales and planning 
horizons. Education and climate literacy, monitoring and forecasting, use of all available 
knowledge sources, sharing of data, information and knowledge, ﬁnance, addressing social 
vulnerability and equity, and institutional support are also essential. Such investments 
enable capacity-building, social learning, and participation in context-speciﬁc adaptation, as 
well as the negotiation of trade-offs and realisation of co-beneﬁts in reducing short-term 
risks and building long-term resilience and sustainability. (high conﬁdence). This report 
reﬂects the state of science for ocean and cryosphere for low levels of global warming 
(1.5ºC), as also assessed in earlier IPCC and IPBES reports. {1.1,  1.5,  1.8.3,  2.3.1,  2.3.2,  2.4, 
Figure 2.7, 2.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4, 5.2.2, Box 5.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 6.8, 6.9, Cross-Chapter 
Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.4.1  
 In light of observed and projected changes in the ocean and cryosphere, many nations will 
face challenges to adapt, even with ambitious mitigation (very high conﬁdence). In a high emissions scenario, many 
ocean- and cryosphere-dependent communities are projected to face adaptation limits (e.g. biophysical, geographical, 
ﬁnancial, technical, social, political and institutional) during the second half of the 21st century. Low emission 
pathways, for comparison, limit the risks from ocean and cryosphere changes in this century and beyond and enable 
more effective responses (high conﬁdence), whilst also creating co-beneﬁts. Profound economic and institutional 
transformative change will enable Climate Resilient Development Pathways in the ocean and cryosphere context 
(high conﬁdence). {1.1, 1.4–1.7, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1–3 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 2.4, Box 3.2, Figure 3.4, Cross-Chapter 
Box 7 in Chapter 3, 3.4.3, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.6, 5.4.2, 5.5.3, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure

C.4.2  
 Intensifying cooperation and coordination among governing authorities across scales, 
jurisdictions, sectors, policy domains and planning horizons can enable effective responses to changes in the ocean, 
cryosphere and to sea level rise (high conﬁdence). Regional cooperation, including treaties and conventions, can 
support adaptation action; however, the extent to which responding to impacts and losses arising from changes

Summary for Policymakers
in the ocean and cryosphere is enabled through regional policy frameworks is currently limited (high conﬁdence). 
Institutional arrangements that provide strong multiscale linkages with local and Indigenous communities beneﬁt 
adaptation (high conﬁdence). Coordination and complementarity between national and transboundary regional 
policies can support efforts to address risks to resource security and management, such as water and ﬁsheries 
(medium conﬁdence). {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4, Box 2.4, 2.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9.2}
C.4.3  
 Experience to date – for example, in responding to sea level rise, water-related risks in some 
high mountains, and climate change risks in the Arctic – also reveal the enabling inﬂuence of taking a long-term 
perspective when making short-term decisions, explicitly accounting for uncertainty of context-speciﬁc risks 
beyond 2050 (high conﬁdence), and building governance capabilities to tackle complex risks (medium conﬁdence). 
{2.3.1, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9, Figure SPM.5}
C.4.4  
 Investments in education and capacity building at various levels and scales facilitates 
social learning and long-term capability for context-speciﬁc responses to reduce risk and enhance resilience (high 
conﬁdence). Speciﬁc activities include utilization of multiple knowledge systems and regional climate information 
into decision making, and the engagement of local communities, Indigenous peoples, and relevant stakeholders in 
adaptive governance arrangements and planning frameworks (medium conﬁdence). Promotion of climate literacy and 
drawing on local, Indigenous and scientiﬁc knowledge systems enables public awareness, understanding and social 
learning about locality-speciﬁc risk and response potential (high conﬁdence). Such investments can develop, and in 
many cases transform existing institutions and enable informed, interactive and adaptive governance arrangements 
(high conﬁdence). {1.8.3, 2.3.2, Figure 2.7, Box 2.4, 2.4, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9}
C.4.5  
 Context-speciﬁc monitoring and forecasting of changes in the ocean and the cryosphere 
informs adaptation planning and implementation, and facilitates robust decisions on trade-offs between short- and 
long-term gains (medium conﬁdence). Sustained long-term monitoring, sharing of data, information and knowledge 
and improved context-speciﬁc forecasts, including early warning systems to predict more extreme El Niño/La Niña 
events, tropical cyclones, and marine heatwaves, help to manage negative impacts from ocean changes such as losses 
in ﬁsheries, and adverse impacts on human health, food security, agriculture, coral reefs, aquaculture, wildﬁre, tourism, 
conservation, drought and ﬂood (high conﬁdence). {2.4, 2.5, 3.5.2, 4.4.4, 5.5.2, 6.3.1, 6.3.3, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 6.9}
C.4.6  
 Prioritising measures to address social vulnerability and equity underpins efforts to promote 
fair and just climate resilience and sustainable development (high conﬁdence), and can be helped by creating safe 
community settings for meaningful public participation, deliberation and conﬂict resolution (medium conﬁdence). 
{Box 2.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, Figure SPM.5}
C.4.7  
 This assessment of the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate reveals the beneﬁts of 
ambitious mitigation and effective adaptation for sustainable development and, conversely, the escalating costs and 
risks of delayed action. The potential to chart Climate Resilient Development Pathways varies within and among 
ocean, high mountain and polar land regions. Realising this potential depends on transformative change. This 
highlights the urgency of prioritising timely, ambitious, coordinated and enduring action (very high conﬁdence).
