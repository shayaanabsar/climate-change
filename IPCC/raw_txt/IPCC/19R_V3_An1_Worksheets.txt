In this Annex only new and updated worksheets are presented (Annex 1 Volume 3 of the 2019 Refinement). The 
worksheets for categories 2B9, 2C1, 2C3, 2E and 2G2 of this annex should be used instead of the worksheets of 
categories 2B9, 2C1, 2C3, 2E and 2G2 in Annex 1 Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The worksheets for 
categories 2B10 and 2C7 are new ones and should be used together with other worksheets in Annex 1 Volume 3 
of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
The other worksheets of Annex 1 of Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines are not refined.

If data on actual production are available, enter that data into column A and enter “1” into each cell in column B. The 
same value for capacity utilization should be entered in each row of column B, and the same value for capacity (or 
actual production) should be entered in each row of column A. 
2) 
In using Tier 1, inventory compilers should not modify, in any way, the set of the fluorinated liquids assumed here. 
Inventory compilers should not combine emissions estimated using Tier 1 method with emissions estimated using the 
Tier 2 method. Neither may inventory compilers change the values of any factors in this column. 
3) 
Typically, global warming potential (100 year time horizon) identified in the IPCC Assessment Report can be used. 
These factors should be the same as those used for other sectors/categories to ensure that they are all internally 
consistent in the inventory.
