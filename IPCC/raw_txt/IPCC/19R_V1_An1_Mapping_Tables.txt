Annex 1 Relating 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines 
This annex provides a road map for relating sections, equations, tables, figures and boxes in the 2019 Refinement 
to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.  
Type of Refinement: U – Update, NG – New Guidance, NR – No Refinement, R – Removed. 
 
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO NATIONAL GHG INVENTORIES 
Refinements undertaken for Chapter 1 involve primarily guidance on establishing GHG inventory arrangements 
that can support the development, improvement and maintenance of national GHG inventories. The Section 1.1 
has been updated by elaboration of concept of anthropogenic emissions and removals related to additional and 
voluntary estimation and reporting of emissions and removals from natural disturbances in Chapter 2 of Volume 
4. A sub-section on the treatment of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from combustion of biomass or biomass-based 
products has also been added. The chapter introduces the concept of institutional arrangements and some examples 
on the functional roles of organisations in the national inventory compilation process. The chapter describes the 
use of different data management systems needed for calculating estimates and for aggregating and reporting GHG 
inventory data.  
Sections 
• 
The Section 1.1 is an update of Section 1.1, Chapter 1, Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and should be 
used instead of the Section 1.1, Chapter 1, Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
• 
The Section 1.4a is a new section in the Chapter 1, Volume 1 of the 2019 Refinement. It should be placed after 
section 1.4, Chapter 1, Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
• 
The Section 1.6 is a new section in the Chapter 1, Volume 1 of the 2019 Refinement. It should be placed after 
Section 1.5, Chapter 1, Volume 1 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

CHAPTER 2 APPROACHES TO DATA COLLECTION  
Chapter 2 contains updated guidance on approaches to data collection and on the development of country specific 
emission factors. New guidance is also provided for the use of facility data in the inventory compilation process, 
considering both cases where data comes from facility reporting programmes built for inventory use and those 
cases where data collection was not originally designed for inventory application.

CHAPTER 3 UNCERTAINTIES 
Refinements undertaken for Chapter 3 involve a series of updates in different sections with the aim to provide 
clear guidance on estimating and reporting uncertainties associated with both annual estimates of emissions and 
removals, and emission and removal trends over time. The chapter is updated, with a series of examples, in order 
to address the inventory compiler on the most appropriate estimators that could be used, within typical 
circumstances and available data, for uncertainty evaluation. Examples of uncertainty calculations in different 
sectors are also provided.

CHAPTER 4 METHODOLOGICAL CHOICE AND IDENTIFICATION OF KEY 
CATEGORIES 
This chapter includes a series of updates on the approaches to identify key categories considering both the level 
and trend assessment. No major modifications with respect to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines have occurred but a 
simplification of the equation to calculate the trend assessment.

CHAPTER 5 TIME SERIES CONSISTENCY 
Refinements undertaken for Chapter 5 involve a series of updates in most sections of this chapter as well as 
provision of new guidance on splicing techniques, most noticeable in relation to non-linear trend analysis. The 
chapter has maintained most of its original outline. Some of the significant updates are the provision of guidance 
to deal with time series consistency in cases wherein new emissions factors become available from the IPCC 
Guidelines, treatment of country-specific categories, maintaining time-series consistency with changes in data 
sources for different years of the time series and examples to illustrate the application of splicing techniques 
already provided in the chapter (e.g. overlap and interpolation methods). The chapter has new guidance on a 
number of time series consistency issues such as ensuring time series consistency when using facility level data, 
guidance on types of surrogate datasets by IPCC sector that could be used to apply the surrogate method as well 
as the application of the non-linear trend analysis method with a practical example.

CHAPTER 6 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL AND 
VERIFICATION 
Chapter 6 contains updated guidance on quantification of emissions estimates based on atmospheric concentration 
measurements. This update is based on the latest scientific literature. Key features of the updates include a 
description of the elements needed for GHG emissions inventory verification using atmospheric measurements 
including the role of inverse modelling and satellite observations. The guidance presents a series of national 
examples wherein practical application of atmospheric measurements for verification of national emission 
inventory estimates has been undertaken. The chapter also presents new guidance on the use and reporting of 
models. This new guidance applies to complex models, generally Tier 3 approaches. A step-by-step approach to 
report on the use of models in emission inventories is presented along with a checklist for ensuring good practice 
in the use of complex, higher tier models in national greenhouse gas inventories.

CHAPTER 7 PRECURSORS AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS 
This chapter includes a series of updates that include improvements in the explanation of the methodology for 
indirect N2O emissions from the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen in NOx and NH3, detailed methodological 
guidance on treatment of CO2 inputs to the atmosphere from emissions of carbon-containing compounds, an update 
on the background science on precursors and indirect emissions. The chapter also incorporates updated guidance 
on non-biogenic sources of CO2 from the atmospheric oxidation of CH4, CO, and NMVOCs, examples of 
NMVOCs from the different source categories as well as data on carbon content of various materials (percent 
carbon by mass, PC) and percent of total solvent NMVOC emissions (by mass, PU). The authors of Chapter 7 
concluded that there is no coherent treatment of indirect emissions across sectors. However, the conclusion was 
that it would have been beyond the scope of the 2019 Refinement to introduce a rigorous framework across all 
sectors with respect to treatment of indirect emissions.
