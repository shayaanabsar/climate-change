TO MULTIPLE LAND USE CATEGORIES

INVENTORY FRAMEWORK  
This section outlines a systematic approach for estimating carbon stock changes (and associated emissions and 
removals of carbon dioxide (CO2) from biomass, dead organic matter, and soils, as well as for estimating non-CO2 
greenhouse gas emissions from fire. General equations representing the level of land-use categories and strata are 
followed by a short description of processes with more detailed equations for carbon stock changes in specific 
pools by land-use category. Principles for estimating non-CO2 emissions and common equations are then given. 
Specific, operational equations to estimate emissions and removals by processes within a pool and by category, 
which directly correspond to worksheet calculations, are provided in Sections 2.3 and 2.4.   
2.2.1 
Overview of carbon stock change estimation 
The emissions and removals of CO2 for the AFOLU Sector, based on changes in ecosystem C stocks, are estimated 
for each land-use category (including both land remaining in a land-use category as well as land converted to 
another land use). Carbon stock changes are summarized by Equation 2.1.

For each land-use category, carbon stock changes are estimated for all strata or subdivisions of land area (e.g., 
climate zone, ecotype, soil type, management regime etc., see Chapter 3) chosen for a land-use category (Equation 
2.2).  Carbon stock changes within a stratum are estimated by considering carbon cycle processes between the five 
carbon pools, as defined in Table 1.1 in Chapter 1. The generalized flowchart of the carbon cycle (Figure 2.1) 
shows all five pools and associated fluxes including inputs to and outputs from the system, as well as all possible 
transfers between the pools. Overall, carbon stock changes within a stratum are estimated by adding up changes 
in all pools as in Equation 2.3.  Further, carbon stock changes in soil may be disaggregated as to changes in C 
stocks in mineral soils and emissions from organic soils. Harvested wood products (HWP) are also included as an 
additional pool.

Estimating changes in carbon pools and fluxes depends on data and model availability, as well as resources and 
capacity to collect and analyse additional information (See Chapter 1, Section 1.3.3 on key category analysis).  
Table 1.1 in Chapter 1 outlines which pools are relevant for each land-use category for Tier 1 methods, including 
cross references to reporting tables.  Depending on country circumstances and which tiers are chosen, stock 
changes may not be estimated for all pools shown in Equation 2.3.  Because of limitations to deriving default data 
sets to support estimation of some stock changes, Tier 1 methods include several simplifying assumptions: 
 change in below-ground biomass C stocks are assumed to be zero under Tier 1 (under Tier 2, country-specific 
data on ratios of below-ground to above-ground biomass can be used to estimate below-ground stock changes); 
 under Tier 1, dead wood and litter pools are often lumped together as ‘dead organic matter’ (see discussion 
below); and 
 dead organic matter stocks are assumed to be zero for non-forest land-use categories under Tier 1. For Forest 
Land converted to another land use, default values for estimating dead organic matter carbon stocks are 
provided in Tier 1.  
The carbon cycle includes changes in carbon stocks due to both continuous processes (i.e., growth, decay) and 
discrete events (i.e., disturbances like harvest, fire, insect outbreaks, land-use change and other events). Continuous 
processes can affect carbon stocks in all areas in each year, while discrete events (i.e., disturbances) cause 
emissions and redistribute ecosystem carbon in specific areas (i.e., where the disturbance occurs) and in the year 
of the event.  
Disturbances may also have long-lasting effects, such as decay of wind-blown or burnt trees. For practicality, Tier 
1 methods assume that all post-disturbance emissions (less removal of harvested wood products) are estimated as 
part of the disturbance event, i.e., in the year of the disturbance. For example, rather than estimating the decay of 
dead organic matter left after a disturbance over a period of several years, all post-disturbance emissions are 
estimated in the year of the event.

flows of carbon into and out of the system as well as between the five C 
pools within the system.  
 
Under Tier 1, it is assumed that the average transfer rate into dead organic matter (dead wood and litter) is equal 
to the average transfer rate out of dead organic matter, so that the net stock change is zero. This assumption means 
that dead organic matter (dead wood and litter) carbon stocks need not be quantified under Tier 1 for land areas 
that remain in a land-use category2. The rationale for this approach is that dead organic matter stocks, particularly 
dead wood, are highly variable and site-specific, depending on forest type and age, disturbance history and 
management. In addition, data on coarse woody debris decomposition rates are scarce and thus it was deemed that 
globally applicable default factors and uncertainty estimates cannot be developed. Countries experiencing 
significant changes in forest types or disturbance or management regimes in their forests are encouraged to develop 
domestic data to estimate the impact from these changes using Tier 2 or 3 methodologies and to report the resulting 
carbon stock changes and non-CO2 emissions and removals.  
All estimates of changes in carbon stocks, i.e., growth, internal transfers and emissions, are in units of carbon to 
make all calculations consistent. Data on biomass stocks, increments, harvests, etc. can initially be in units of dry 
matter that need to be converted to tonnes of carbon for all subsequent calculations. There are two fundamentally 
different and equally valid approaches to estimating stock changes: 1) the process-based approach, which estimates 
the net balance of additions to and removals from a carbon stock; and 2) the stock-based approach, which estimates 
the difference in carbon stocks at two points in time. 
Annual carbon stock changes in any pool can be estimated using the process-based approach in Equation 2.4 which 
sets out the Gain-Loss Method that can be applied to all carbon gains or losses. Gains can be attributed to growth 
(increase of biomass) and to transfer of carbon from another pool (e.g., transfer of carbon from the live biomass 
carbon pool to the dead organic matter pool due to harvest or natural disturbances). Gains are always marked with 
a positive (+) sign. Losses can be attributed to transfers of carbon from one pool to another (e.g., the carbon in the

Note that CO2 removals are transfers from the atmosphere to a pool, whereas CO2 emissions are transfers from a 
pool to the atmosphere. Not all transfers involve emissions or removals, since any transfer from one pool to another 
is a loss from the donor pool but is a gain of equal amount to the receiving pool. For example, a transfer from the 
above-ground biomass pool to the dead wood pool is a loss from the above-ground biomass pool and a gain of 
equal size for the dead wood pool, which does not necessarily result in immediate CO2 emission to the atmosphere 
(depending on the Tier used).  
The method used in Equation 2.4 is called the Gain-Loss Method, because it includes all processes that bring about 
changes in a pool. An alternative stock-based approach is termed the Stock-Difference Method, which can be used 
where carbon stocks in relevant pools are measured at two points in time to assess carbon stock changes, as 
represented in Equation 2.5.

each stratum to obtain the total stock change estimate for the pool.  In some cases, the activity data may be in the 
form of country totals (e.g., harvested wood) in which case the stock change estimates for that pool are estimated 
directly from the activity data after applying appropriate factors to convert to units of C mass. When using the 
Stock-Difference Method for a specific land-use category, it is important to ensure that the area of land in that 
category at times t1 and t2 is identical, to avoid confounding stock change estimates with area changes. 
The process method lends itself to modelling approaches using coefficients derived from empirical research data. 
These will smooth out inter-annual variability to a greater extent than the stock change method which relies on the 
difference of stock estimates at two points in time. Both methods are valid so long as they are capable of 
representing actual disturbances as well as continuously varying trends and can be verified by comparison with 
actual measurements. 
2.2.2 
Overview of non-CO2 emission estimation  
Non-CO2 emissions are derived from a variety of sources, including emissions from soils, livestock and manure, 
and from combustion of biomass, dead wood and litter.  In contrast to the way CO2 emissions are estimated from 
biomass stock changes, the estimate of non-CO2 greenhouse gases usually involves an emission rate from a source

directly to the atmosphere.  The rate (Equation 2.6) is generally determined by an emission factor for a specific 
gas (e.g., CH4, N2O) and source category and an area (e.g., for soil or area burnt), population (e.g., for livestock) 
or mass (e.g., for biomass or manure) that defines the emission source.

Many of the emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases are either associated with a specific land use (e.g., CH4 
emissions from rice) or are typically estimated from national-level aggregate data (e.g., CH4 emissions from 
livestock and N2O emissions from managed soils). Where an emission source is associated with a single land use, 
the methodology for that emission is described in the chapter for that specific land-use category (e.g., methane 
from rice in Chapter 5 on Cropland). Emissions that are generally based on aggregated data are dealt with in 
separate chapters (e.g., Chapter 10 on livestock-related emissions, and Chapter 11 on N2O emissions from managed 
soils and CO2 emissions from liming and urea applications). This chapter describes only methods to estimate non-
CO2 (and CO2) emissions from biomass combustion, which can occur in several different land-use categories.

CONSISTENCY BETWEEN AFOLU PROJECTS OR ACTIVITIES AND IPCC INVENTORY GUIDELINES 
The information presented in this Box is for information purposes only 
IPCC guidelines have been designed for national GHG inventories (NGHGI). They are, however, 
often applied, in conjunction with other guidance, to estimate GHG emissions and removals for 
different situations than those in a NGHGI. These different situations include scales (i.e. to any sub-
aggregation of land), time resolution (i.e., on a non-annual basis), length of time series (i.e., for a 
limited period) and/or for selected carbon pools. Using IPCC guidelines for estimating emissions 
and removals from sub-aggregations - i.e. projects and activities – can help countries maintain 
consistency with the NGHGI. However, projects and activities can introduce additional complexities 
including, but not limited to, system boundaries, double-counting, leakage, and attribution. 
Moreover, projects and activities may use different definitions, sources of data, data and methods 
compared to those used for the NGHGI, including different Approaches for land representation and 
methodological Tiers, impacting the consistency between the two. These need to be considered when 
applying the IPCC Guidelines outside of a NGHGI (IPCC, 2015), particularly when there is a need 
for consistency and comparability. 
Thus, when using IPCC guidelines for projects and activities the following steps should be 
considered:  
i) 
Define the spatial boundaries of the territory impacted by the activity; 
ii) 
Identify the land-use categories and subcategories of the NGHGI impacted by the activity. 
iii) 
Identify pools and gases impacted by the activity; 
iv) 
Identify the time frame (temporal boundaries) of the activity and ensure full reporting of 
any legacy emissions and removals associated with it3; 
v) 
Develop estimates by applying methods consistent with IPCC guidance, so ensuring 
consistency among the results of activities and the trends of times series of relevant NGHGI 
categories.

CONSISTENCY BETWEEN AFOLU PROJECTS OR ACTIVITIES AND IPCC INVENTORY GUIDELINES  
For example, 1) Reducing Emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of 
conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in 
developing countries (REDD-plus) activities could be identified in the NGHGI as IPCC categories, 
subcategories, or sums of categories or sub-categories (GFOI, 2016), and relevant IPCC methods 
applied consistently; 2) The Australian Government has developed a framework as part of the 
Emissions Reduction Fund 4 for ensuring consistency in emissions estimation between AFOLU 
project-level mitigation activities and Australia's NGHGI. This framework includes integrity 
standards 5  to ensure emissions estimation methods are consistent with IPCC guidelines, and 
consequently estimated GHG reductions are consistent with trends of times series of relevant 
NGHGI categories. 
Emissions and removals estimates for activities are likely to apply Approach 2 or 3 and Tier 2 or 3 
methods because of the need to prepare GHG estimates that are more disaggregated per activity, e.g. 
organic farming vs traditional farming or coppice vs high-stand, and per population, e.g. by livestock 
sub-populations, 
crop 
types 
and 
forest 
types. 
Moreover, 
stratification 
of 
NGHGI 
categories/subcategories into subdivisions helps avoid double counting of emissions and removals 
from a single category that is impacted by more than an activity.  
Stratification also supports transparency among activity report and NGHGI estimates when the 
activity does not correspond to an entire NGHGI category. In many cases, activities and projects 
require tracking of land where they occur through time, e.g. no tillage. In such cases, Approach 3 
for land representation is required since it is the only approach that provides the spatially explicit 
information (either wall-to-wall or from sampling) across time needed to track activities and drivers, 
and to support estimation of GHG emissions or removals with higher accuracy. Where activities are 
known to lead to permanent changes or the activity includes management practices that determine 
temporary changes in the land cover, Approach 2 methods may provide sufficient information to 
prepare accurate estimates. 
Where activity and project data have been collected and analysed consistently with good practice, 
they can be used in the NGHGI either for deriving activity data and/or emission factors, or any other 
ancillary data used for preparing GHG estimates for the land subject to the activity, or for calibrating 
the model used in the NGHGI for the same land and/or verifying the outputs of such model. Where 
data have inconsistencies with those collected for the NGHGI, iterations and cross-checks between 
NGHGI experts and experts involved in the monitoring of the activity should be done until 
improvements applied to the activity and/or the NGHGI estimates enable consistency. When using 
data collected from activities and projects for improving or evaluating information and estimates 
reported in the NGHGI, it is important to: 
i) 
Define and report the reference conditions (e.g. climate, soil, management system) for 
which the data from the activity or project are valid and how it could be used in the NGHGI 
compilation; 
ii) 
Determine if the activity or emissions factor data in the project are representative of the 
national average and, if not, apply methods that ensure the NGHGI is not biased by them, 
e.g. limiting the use of the data to the land subject to the activity or project only and 
modifying the data used in the NGHGI to prevent bias 
iii) 
Define and report the level of variability (heterogeneity) of the data; 
iv) 
Ensure the data is available and consistently applied for the entire time series.

C stock changes associated with the activities, including lagged emissions and removals.

Conversion of C stock changes to CO2 emissions 
For reporting purposes, changes in C stock categories (that involve transfers to the atmosphere) can be converted 
to units of CO2 emissions by multiplying the C stock change by -44/12. In cases where a significant amount of the 
carbon stock change is through emissions of CO and CH4, then these non-CO2 carbon emissions should be 
subtracted from the estimated CO2 emissions or removals using methods provided for the estimation of these gases. 
In making these estimates, inventory compilers should assess each category to ensure that this carbon is not already 
covered by the assumptions and approximations made in estimating CO2 emissions. 
It should also be noted that not every stock change corresponds to an emission. The conversion to CO2 from C, is 
based on the ratio of molecular weights (44/12). The change of sign (-) is due to the convention that increases in 
C stocks, i.e. positive (+) stock changes, represent a removal (or ‘negative’ emission) from the atmosphere, while 
decreases in C stocks, i.e. negative (-) stock changes, represent a positive emission to the atmosphere

2.3.1.3 ADDITIONAL GENERIC GUIDANCE FOR TIER 2 METHODS 
A. USING ALLOMETRIC MODELS FOR BIOMASS ESTIMATION 
This section provides new guidance to inventory compilers on the use of allometric models (see Box 2.0b for 
definitions) for quantifying volume, biomass and carbon stocks in land uses containing vegetation. Allometric 
models can be used with country specific data to estimate carbon stocks at the Tier 2 level. Allometric models may 
also form part of more sophisticated Tier 3 approaches including measurement-based inventories and model-based 
inventories.   
Allometric models quantify the relationships between certain size variables of organisms. Allometric models6 can 
be used to estimate volume, biomass or carbon stocks of individuals, vegetation or forest stands. Allometric models 
have been developed for a wide range of species, habitats, regions and environmental conditions (e.g. documented 
in the GlobAllomeTree database (http://www.globallometree.org/; Schepaschenko et al, 2017). Allometric models 
used for forest tree species are commonly estimated from individual trees through destructive sampling from a 
population using a sampling design that provides accurate and representative data. As destructive sampling is 
usually costly and labour intensive or ecologically sensitive, it makes sense to utilize existing allometric models 
when valid under the respective conditions as outlined below (in the section on the use of allometric models). 
                                                           
6  The term “allometric equation” is also used when referencing to the mathematical descriptions of allometric models and 
relationships. When the parameters are estimated from sample data and/or uncertainty is involved, “model” is the correct 
term. Although allometric models are used to predict the values of a variable, for practical reasons in the context of these 
guidelines the term estimates is also used.

2.14

BOX 2.0B (NEW) 
ALLOMETRIC DEFINITIONS 
Allometry: The term allometry refers to the proportional relationship between the relative 
dimensional relationships or growth rates of two size variables and therefore allometric relations 
allow that one variable can be used to predict the corresponding value of another variable. For 
example, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) can be used to estimate tree volume or total tree 
biomass. Allometry can also describe the change of one part of an organism in relation to the change 
of its body size, either in the same organism (while growing over time), in populations (e.g., tree 
stands), or between species (e.g. different tree species). These changes follow rules, so the change 
in proportion between two variables of an organism can be described mathematically. 
 Allometric model: An allometric model is a formula that quantitatively describes an allometric 
relationship. The basic form is an equation: y=f(x) where y and x are the dependent and independent 
variables. Often the equation is in the form of y = a*x^b + c, where a, b and c are parameters (please 
note: “c” is not identical to the statistical error term “ε”). If “x” is equal to zero (e.g., if height is 
below breast height when using DBH to estimate tree biomass), then “y” is equal to the parameter 
“c”, noting that biologically “y” is always a positive number. Parameter “a” is the value of y if x is 1 
and describes the initial ratio between x and y . The parameter “b” is also called an “allometric parameter” 
or “allometric constant” and gives the proportionality between the relative increases of “x” and “y” 
(Fabrika und Pretzsch 2013; Picard et al. 2012). The general form of an allometric model, without 
intercept (i.e. when “c” = 0), is also often represented in its logarithmic transformation as a linear 
relationship, log(y) = log(a) + b*log(x) or ln(y) = ln(a) + b*ln(x). Other mathematical functions have 
also been adopted to describe allometric relationships.  
This basic model can be augmented by additional terms that include e.g. tree height as a second 
predictor variable (e.g. Ketterings et al. 2001). Models are usually provided with a residual error 
term (e.g., y = f(x) + ε), set in the model fitting against the sample data; to consider the residual 
error, calculated for each model, can be used to assess the uncertainty related to use of the selected 
model in the estimation process. 
The use of allometric models 
The choice of appropriate allometric models should be based on several criteria including the availability of 
country-specific data, the meta-data about the allometric models, the coincidence of data with the models’ domain 
of validity according to the meta-data, and the appropriateness of the allometric model by comparing the estimates 
to ones obtained with the Tier 1 method (Figure 2.2a). The accuracy of the models may be lower than e.g. available 
default factors or Biomass Emission Factors (BEFs), so it is good practice to choose the method with the higher 
accuracy. When applying an allometric model for predicting the biomass of a given species or at a given site, data 
on required variables must be available as e.g. from national forest inventories (Tomppo et al. 2010, Vidal et al. 
2016). For woody plant species, these variables commonly include DBH and height, and to lesser extent crown 
variables such as crown length or crown width. For shrubs or smaller trees and understorey vegetation, diameters 
nearer to the ground or shoot length may be used, among other variables. Carbon fractions and basic wood density 
may also be required for some models. Individual tree estimates can then be aggregated up to provide volume, 
biomass or carbon stock estimates at higher spatial scales (e.g. by plot, region or nation-wide). Tree-level estimates 
may refer to the whole tree, or individual components like above-ground and below-ground parts, stem, branches 
and/or foliage. Allometric models may be used within a specified forest stratum, to estimate above-ground and 
below-ground biomass estimation from direct measurements e.g. forest inventory plots. Allometric models may 
also be used for non-woody plant biomass estimates. Data collection programmes are often designed to collect the 
data specifically for this purpose.   
Allometries are influenced by an individual’s growing conditions and size classes, so in each case the allometric 
models developed will have a limited domain of validity. When selecting an appropriate allometric model, check 
the associated metadata supplied. Conditions such as: 
 Ecoregion, geographic range, environmental factors (e.g., ecosystem, climatic or soil types), 
 Representativeness of the model in consideration of individual size range and sampled population,  
 Plant components estimated (e.g., above-ground, below-ground, stem, branches, foliage), 
 Species functional traits (e.g., wood density and tree architecture), 
 Land or crop management practices, current and historic,

should be assessed for their suitability (Henry et al. 2011; Rock 2007; Vieilledent et al. 2012) as well as sample 
size and accuracy assessment. The use of existing allometric models beyond the range they were developed for 
may result in a lack of accuracy (e.g. Mugasha et al 2016; Nam et al, 2016), depending on the degree to which 
external variables control the partitioning of biomass among components and the geometric relationships of the 
species. The applicability of a model can also be tested using a representative data set (e.g. Paul et al, 2016; Perez-
Cruzado et al, 2015; Youkhana et al 2017). The accuracy of the allometric model should be assessed by evaluating 
the related statistical indicators.

Generalized and site or species-specific allometric models have been developed for use in different circumstances. 
While species-specific models will give more accurate estimates for the respective tree species (all other aspects 
being the same as the ones for which the model was developed) (Henry et al. 2011), generalized models may be 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.16 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
better suited in regions with a very large diversity of tree species, where models are lacking for a large proportion 
of species. The use of species-specific models however is encouraged for the species for which specific models 
and appropriate input data are available. For natural forests, which may contain many different species, application 
of species-specific allometric models may be impractical; in this case, a model specific for the ecosystem type can 
be used (Krisnawati et al, 2012). When species-specific or ecosystem-specific models are not available, regionally 
relevant allometric models can be applied (Chave et al., 2004). Generic models developed based on a large number 
of sample trees across landscapes tend to be more reliable than locally developed models if these are based on only 
a small number of individuals (Chave et al 2005; Chave et al 2014; Paul et al, 2016).  
Stand level models and their equations 
When individual or species specific allometric models for biomass or carbon stocks are not appropriate, stand level 
allometric models, which may include canopy height, basal area and community age as predictor variables, may 
be applicable to estimate biomass parameters. Stand-level allometric models using canopy height estimate carbon 
stocks per unit area based on the assumption that canopy height is directly proportional to biomass (Mascaro et al, 
2011; Saatchi et al, 2011). Information on canopy height can be predicted from ground-based inventory or by 
remote sensing such as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), polarimetric interferometry SAR or 
airborne imagery. Auxiliary information such as digital elevation models are necessary to predict canopy height 
from airborne and satellite-borne imagery because only canopy surface elevation can be predicted from them. The 
accuracy of carbon stock estimation from canopy height depends on the number of field measurement plots used 
to estimate the relationship between canopy height and carbon stocks. Basal area is an important parameter to 
understand stand characteristics and it is used in the model to estimate stand volume or stand biomass. Basal area 
is estimated easily in the field using simple equipment. When basal area is used in the stand-level model to estimate 
biomass or carbon stocks, mean tree height is also needed in the model (Lang et al, 2016; Mensah et al, 2016). The 
stand-level allometric model estimated from community age estimates carbon stocks per unit area by assuming 
that community biomass increases monotonically as the forest ages, and then drawing a saturation curve for 
community age (Inoue et al, 2010). It is applicable where land use is rotated at fixed intervals, so that a mosaic of 
communities of different ages exists. 
Tier 3 methods 
The hierarchical tier structure implies that use of higher tiers (Tier 2 or Tier 3) usually results in an increased 
accuracy of the method and/or emissions factor and other parameters used in the estimation of the emissions and 
removals. Tier 3 approaches for biomass carbon stock change estimation allow for a variety of methods, including 
measurement-based forest inventories. Measurement-based Tier 3 inventories require detailed national forest 
inventories containing data on growing stock, and, ideally, repeated measurements from which periodic increments 
can be estimated. In some circumstances these data are used directly in empirical models while in other cases they 
are supplemented with allometric models (for example, Chambers et al. (2001) and Baker et al. (2004) for the 
Amazon; Seiler et al. (2014) for tropical forest of Bolivia, Jenkins et al. (2004) and Kurz and Apps (2006) for 
North America; and Zianis et al. (2005) for Europe, Paul et al. (2016) for Australia, Luo et al. (2014) for China, 
Youkhana et al 2017 for tropical grasses), calibrated to national circumstances that allow for direct estimation of 
biomass increment or growth. Model-based Tier 3 inventories build on model-specific input data and may contain 
allometric models as empirical model components. Additional information related to the use of higher Tier 
methods can be found in Section 2.5. 
Uncertainty 
Sources of uncertainty when using allometric models include:  
1. Model-related uncertainty, i.e. the uncertainty related to the model used, stemming from the estimation of the 
parameters of this model and residual variability around model; 
2. Sampling variability and measurement errors in input data (see volume 1, chapter 3, section 3.1.6 for 
additional information); 
3. The uncertainty of transferring the model to trees not used for estimation of the parameters (lack of 
representativeness) (see volume 1, chapter 3, section 3.1.6 for additional information). 
Magnitudes of the effects of the first and second sources should be reported with the model, the latter can be 
reduced by careful selection of models.  
Recalculations 
Recalculations of C stocks may be necessary, if new and/or better data or methodology becomes available. When 
BEF’s are replaced with parameters that are estimated using allometries, recalculations across the time series will 
be required. The replacement of generalised models with species-specific models also may require recalculations. 
It should be noted that allometry can change over time (Lopez-Serrano et al. 2005), for example, if the thinning 
regime in a plantation forest is changed. This may influence the ratio of crown biomass / DBH and, over time, the 
trees in this plantation may show different allometric relationships at two distant points in time. An updated 
 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories

2.17 
allometric model would therefore be required in order to reflect the impact of the changes. In this case, to ensure 
time series consistency, apply the guidance provided in Volume 1 Chapter 5 and in Volume 4, Chapter 4 in relation 
to the Forest Land category  
New technologies  
Remotely sensed data from airborne or terrestrial platforms can be useful sources of information for deriving 
variables relevant for constructing and validating allometric models. They can improve measurements of height, 
volume and crown dimensions of individual trees that are difficult to collect with traditional ground-based 
approaches, particularly in dense and complex canopies. They can underpin a new generation of allometric models 
which have tree height and crown size as explanatory variables (Jucker et al, 2017). Of particular potential is 
terrestrial laser scanning, offering a means to collect data on tree volume in a non-destructive manner (see Box 
2.0c). 
BOX 2.0C (NEW) 
NEW TECHNOLOGY: TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNING 
Terrestrial laser scanning is a ground-based active remote sensing technique which can be used to 
derive 3D vegetation structure, and compute key variables such as tree height, stem diameter, crown 
dimensions and tree volume for above-ground biomass predictions and to develop and validate 
allometric models (Calders et al., 2015). These under-canopy terrestrial laser systems emit millions 
of laser pulses that reflect off solid objects such as trunks, branches and leaves and form 3D point 
clouds. Individual trees can be segmented from plot-scale point cloud data and individual tree point 
clouds can then be used to reconstruct the woody elements of a tree.  
Terrestrial laser scanning provides non-destructive and highly detailed measurements independent 
of the size and shape of a tree that are otherwise only available from destructive methods (Disney et 
al., 2018). Aboveground biomass calculated from the point cloud data is independent of allometry 
and with quantifiable accuracy. Many trees can be sampled and measured in an efficient manner and 
can provide most of the fundamental data needed to develop new or test the usefulness of existing 
allometric models for NGHGIs. Terrestrial laser scanning has proven useful for large and complex 
tropical trees (Gonzalez de Tanago et al., 2018). Terrestrial laser scanners cannot measure 
belowground or look inside trees, i.e. they do not provide information on wood density or whether 
a tree is hollow. 
B. USING ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS DENSITY MAP CONSTRUCTED FROM 
REMOTELY SENSED DATA FOR BIOMASS ESTIMATION 
Biomass density maps are wall-to-wall, polygon- or pixel-based predictions of above-ground biomass for woody 
plants and trees. 
Consideration when developing biomass density maps  
Biomass density maps are constructed by combining remotely sensed data (see Box 2.0d) and field observations. 
They have been developed at national scales (e.g., Avitabile et al., 2012) as well as for continental to global scales 
(e.g., Baccini et al., 2012; Saatchi et al., 2011, Avitabile et al., 2016). The characteristics and usefulness of biomass 
density maps for NGHGIs depend on multiple factors: 
1. The definitions for forest and aboveground woody biomass used to produce the map and how this definition 
relates to the one used in the NGHGI. 
2. The type of remotely sensed data sources in terms of spatial resolution, temporal coverage and the degree to 
which the signal responds to aboveground biomass (sensitivity). The response depends on the type and 
biomass ranges of the woody plants. Different remote sensing technologies have varying abilities for 
predicting biomass for different types of woody plants (i.e. boreal versus tropics) and combining remotely 
sensed data from multiple sources can increase sensitivity and the resulting accuracy of biomass density 
predictions. 
3. The method used to construct the map. Such methods can range from simple interpolation of field estimates 
of biomass density using spatial covariates to more complex modelling of above-ground woody biomass using 
field estimates and observed remotely sensed signals.  
4. The availability and reliability of biomass estimates obtained from field data needed to produce and validate 
the biomass density map. Combining co-located remotely sensed data and field observations can be 
challenging because of the size and shape of the primary elements (i.e. field plot size and shape versus 
geometric resolution of remotely sensed data), the timing of their acquisition, accuracy of geolocations, and

differences in the variables and parameters that are measured and estimated in the field and predicted from 
the remotely sensed data.  
5. The degree to which map uncertainty is characterized and the manner in which it is used to assess bias and 
precision for large area estimates in support of NGHGIs (see Volume IV, Chapter 3). 
BOX 2.0D (NEW) 
REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES 
Optical, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) sensors are 
available currently as remote sensing data sources for producing biomass density maps. Data from 
optical satellite sensors are classified into three types on the basis of their spatial resolution; coarse 
resolution data with a pixel size greater than about 250 m (e.g., MODIS), medium resolution data 
with a pixel size of 10-80 m (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel 1 and 2), and fine resolution data with a 
pixel size smaller than 10 m (e.g., Rapideye or SPOT and ALOS-2).  
SAR and LiDAR are active sensors available as air borne and space borne instruments whose derived 
metrics are used to predict height, volume or biomass of woody plants and trees. SAR emits 
microwave pulses obliquely and measures attributes of the pulses that are reflected back from the 
Earth’s surface towards the sensor. In forest land, emitted pulses reflect from the ground, or canopy 
or trunk of woody plants and trees. Using the strength of the signal of the reflected pulses, volume 
or biomass of woody plants and trees can be predicted as demonstrated for satellite data from ALOS-
PALSAR and Sentinel 1 (Santoro and Cartus, 2018). LiDAR emits laser pulses and measures the 
traveling time from the sensor to the target which can be converted to distance. When the LiDAR 
emitter is aimed at woody plants and trees, these laser pulses can be reflected by the woody 
components, the leaves within the canopy, or the ground surface. Using the difference of a laser 
pulse reflected from canopy and ground surface, the height, volume or biomass of woody plants and 
trees can be predicted (Næsset 1997a,b, Lim et al 2003). Starting in 2019, a series of targeted space-
based missions will improve the capabilities for forest biomass predictions from LiDAR (e.g. GEDI, 
ICESAT-2) and SAR (e.g. BIOMASS, NISAR), that might be found useful for national purposes 
(Herold et al. 2019). 
Besides mapping biomass density, there are evolving approaches that monitor changes in biomass density through 
time directly from remotely sensed data (Baccini et al., 2017). Such approaches require consistent measurements 
and estimates, and such consistency can be challenging when different satellite data sources and different ways of 
processing and analysing the data are used. In principle, the direct prediction of wall-to-wall biomass change has 
the advantage of including all detectable change events, including those occurring in forest remaining forest (i.e., 
forest degradation and regrowth) which are not considered when a single biomass map is combined with activity 
data characterizing land use change. However, the sensitivity of the remotely sensed data to subtle biomass changes 
needs to be carefully evaluated. The mapped biomass change might also not distinguish between anthropogenic or 
natural causes and not fully characterize all components of the carbon emissions. For example, some carbon loss 
may have accumulated as dead organic matter (e.g., dead wood or litter), and additional data are usually required 
to estimate the fate of that initial biomass (e.g., burned, left on site, and removed from the site). 
Because above-ground woody biomass is the variable predicted from remotely sensed data, additional information 
such as country-specific data for root-to-shoot ratios are needed to estimate carbon stocks in other pools.  
Guidance on the use of biomass density maps for national GHG inventories  
Biomass density maps can be used to enhance the stratification of ground carbon inventories, to improve the 
estimation of carbon emissions by increasing data density in under-sampled or inaccessible areas, and as an 
independent data source for verification purposes (provided that the field data were not used to predict the biomass 
density maps used for stratification).  
Use of biomass maps for the estimation of carbon emissions at Tier 2 and Tier 3 levels can be achieved in several 
ways: 
1. Combination with activity data where a biomass density map provides the base to estimate emission factors. 
Such analyses require consistency among the activity data and biomass maps concerning definitions, 
geolocation, and spatial and temporal data characteristics. The use of regionally aggregated emission factor 
analysis (i.e., using average estimates for different forest types, or change trajectories) helps to reduce inherent 
pixel-level uncertainties in biomass map data for national-scale estimations. Countries have used such an 
approach to increase data density in areas under-sampled by ground inventories (see Box 2.0e).  
2. Estimate biomass change directly from multi-temporal biomass density maps. Such an approach would 
provide an assessment of carbon stock changes in above-ground biomass from land use change and, in 
 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.19 
particular, it would also include changes within forests remaining forests such as degradation and regrowth, 
management and harvest, and natural disturbances. Such analysis requires consistent and well-calibrated 
biomass density maps using ground and remotely sensed data to accurately estimate biomass changes; a 
quality requirement that has so far not been achieved for the NGHGIs at this stage. Improvements in both the 
field estimates of biomass change and remote sensing technologies and analysis in the coming years can lead 
to such approaches becoming more efficient and accurate for NGHGI purposes. 
3. Biomass density maps can be integrated with remote sensing-assisted, time-series of land change and/or with 
Tier 3 models to localize emissions estimates. This way the biomass map data can be linked to land and carbon 
evolution over time that better reflect the complexity of forest-related carbon fluxes. Critical for this type of 
application is the consistency among the various data sources and models concerning definitions (forest, 
biomass pools), and, spatial and temporal data characteristics. Map unit uncertainties in biomass maps 
propagate to larger area estimates and can lead to substantial uncertainties in national emissions estimation if 
not properly considered.  
The application of such approaches requires maps well-calibrated for national circumstances. Many available 
large-area biomass maps, such as global biomass maps, might not be consistent with national definitions of forest 
and/or biomass pools, and often exhibit large systematic errors in the estimation of carbon stock and changes for 
national and local assessments (Avitabile et al., 2016). Since countries may have national products, including 
biomass maps, large-area biomass maps can be useful for the purpose of independent comparison and verification. 
Depending on how a map is produced and how it is used to enhance NGHGIs, additional metadata on the applied 
models and procedures used to produce the map, such as for example the covariance matrix of model parameters 
of a model that was used to generate the map (see Volume 1, Chapter 6, section 6.1.4.2), may be required for 
characterization and reporting of uncertainty in a fully compliant way, particularly for application to country-
specific circumstances. 
BOX 2.0E (NEW) 
USING A BIOMASS MAP FOR GHG ESTIMATION: AN EXAMPLE FROM THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON  
Brazil is applying a methodology for estimating forest biomass combining data from airborne 
LiDAR, satellite remote sensing and forest inventories. The aim for using the biomass map for the 
NGHGI is to provide coverage over the whole Amazon where the availability and quality of ground 
data varies. Deforestation and associated land use change in the Amazon are heterogeneous and 
patchy. Related estimates of carbon emissions carry some level of uncertainty unless this spatial 
variability in both types of change and biomass variability is captured.  
The methodology to estimate the biomass was based on 1,000 LiDAR transects randomly distributed 
across 3.5 million km2 of the Amazon forests. Aboveground biomass is estimated at three different 
levels. At field plot level (first level), the data are used to validate the biomass estimated by LiDAR 
(second level) by adopting and using the models and data provided by Chave et al 2014 and Longo 
et al 2016. A total of 407 field plots were used for this validation. At the third level the biomass was 
estimated by extrapolating the biomass to the Brazilian Amazon Biome by the use of MODIS 
vegetation index, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data, precipitation data from the Tropical 
Rainfall Measuring Mission and Synthetic Aperture Radar data of the Phased Array type L-band 
Synthetic Aperture Radar, soil and vegetation maps. A nonparametric regression method (Random 
Forest) is used for correlating the above ground biomass within the LiDAR transects to a list of 
variables, and then used for the extrapolation of the biomass to the region. The coefficient of 
determination and the root mean squared error between the third level extrapolated biomass data and 
the LiDAR data were R2=0.7485 and RMSE=27.18 MgCha-1, respectively. In this process, the 
SRTM elevation data were the most important variable for the biomass extrapolation process, 
followed by the TRMM precipitation data and Enhanced Vegetation Index data. The estimated 
biomass map uncertainty is calculated by propagating the uncertainties through the different levels 
of biomass estimation, i.e., field plots, LiDAR and satellite (Longo et al 2016). This process allows 
us to obtain total uncertainty estimates for each pixel in the final biomass map.

Change in carbon stocks in dead organic matter 
No refinement in Introduction. 
2.3.2.1 LAND REMAINING IN A LAND-USE CATEGORY 
The Tier 1 assumption for both dead wood and litter pools (see table 1.1 for definitions) for all land-use categories 
is that their stocks are not changing over time if the land remains within the same land-use category. Thus, the 
carbon in biomass killed during a disturbance or management event (less removal of harvested wood products) is 
assumed to be released entirely to the atmosphere in the year of the event. This is equivalent to the assumption 
that the carbon in non-merchantable and non-commercial components that are transferred to dead organic matter 
is equal to the amount of carbon released from dead organic matter to the atmosphere through decomposition and 
oxidation. Countries can use higher tier methods to estimate the carbon dynamics of dead organic matter. This 
section describes estimation methods if Tier 2 (or 3) methods are used. 
Countries that use Tier 1 methods to estimate dead organic matter (DOM) pools in land remaining in the same 
land-use category, report zero changes in carbon stocks or carbon emissions from those pools. Following this rule, 
CO2 emissions resulting from the combustion of dead organic matter during fire are not reported, nor are the 
increases in dead organic matter carbon stocks in the years following fire. However, emissions of non-CO2 gases 
from burning of DOM pools are reported.  Tier 2 methods for estimation of carbon stock changes in DOM pools 
calculate the changes in dead wood and litter carbon pools (Equation 2.17). Two methods can be used: either track 
inputs and outputs (the Gain-Loss Method, Equation 2.18) or estimate the difference in DOM pools at two points 
in time (Stock-Difference Method, Equation 2.19). These estimates require either detailed inventories that include 
repeated measurements of dead wood and litter pools, or models that simulate dead wood and litter dynamics. It 
is good practice to ensure that such models are tested against field measurements and are documented. Figure 2.3 
provides the decision tree for identification of the appropriate tier to estimate changes in carbon stocks in dead 
organic matter.

The changes in carbon stocks in the dead wood and litter pools for an area remaining in a land-use category

The net balance of DOM pools specified in Equation 2.18, requires the estimation of both the inputs and outputs 
from annual processes (litterfall and decomposition) and the inputs and losses associated with disturbances. In 
practice, therefore, Tier 2 and Tier 3 approaches require estimates of the transfer and decay rates as well as activity 
data on harvesting and disturbances and their impacts on DOM pool dynamics. Note that the biomass inputs into 
DOM pools used in Equation 2.18 are a subset of the biomass losses estimated in Equation 2.7. The biomass losses 
in Equation 2.7 contain additional biomass that is removed from the site through harvest or lost to the atmosphere, 
in the case of fire. 
The method chosen depends on available data and will likely be coordinated with the method chosen for biomass 
carbon stocks. Transfers into and out of a dead wood or litter pool for Equation 2.18 may be difficult to estimate. 
The stock difference method described in Equation 2.19 can be used by countries with forest inventory data that 
include DOM pool information, other survey data sampled according to the principles set out in Annex 3A.3 
(Sampling) in Chapter 3, and/or models that simulate dead wood and litter dynamics. 
When the gain – loss method is chosen, inventory measurements may provide estimates for DOM stocks. 
Alternatively, relevant information on transfers out of the litter and dead wood pools through decomposition can 
be found in the literature. Care must be taken not to confound decomposition flow “rates” and decomposition 
“rate-constants” (e.g., k’s) when DOMout is estimated. DOMout using the second approach is the product of the 
rate-constant describing the proportion lost per year and the stock of DOM (e.g., DOMout = k *DOM). One should 
be aware that decomposition rate-constants describe total losses and not just those via respiration. The fate of 
leached and fragmented carbon is not well understood; much of the material is likely respired but whether this is 
slower or faster than the source material is highly variable. Negative exponential decay models are commonly used 
to determine the decomposition rate-constants that characterize the volume, mass, or density loss in dead wood 
and litter over time (Cook et al. 2016, Harmon et al. 2000, Russell et al. 2014). While models to predict volume, 
biomass, or density loss are relatively simple, the decomposition rate-constants may vary substantially. The 
decomposition of dead wood and litter mass is driven by many factors including: woodiness (i.e., wood and bark 
versus foliage); position (i.e., standing versus downed dead wood); species of the material decomposing; state of 
decomposition (i.e., fresh versus highly decomposed) and decomposers present (e.g., the presence of termites 
and/or soil biota); climate under the canopy (for example condition by openness of the canopy) (Lavelle et al., 
1993; Hattenschwiler et al., 2005, Harmon et al. 2011, García‐Palacios et al., 2013, Russell et al., 2014, Filser et 
al. 2016, Chertov et al. 2017, Hu et al., 2017, Kornarnov et al. 2017), among others. Having specific information 
on these attributes will help to assign a specific decomposition constant to a particular DOM stock (Rock et al. 
2008).

Note that whenever the stock change method is used (e.g., in Equation 2.19), the area used in the carbon stock 
calculations at times t1 and t2 must be identical. If the area is not identical then changes in area will confound the 
estimates of carbon stocks and stock changes. It is good practice to use the area at the end of the inventory period 
(t2) to define the area of land remaining in the land-use category. The stock changes on all areas that change land-
use category between t1 and t2 are estimated in the new land-use category, as described in the sections on land 
converted to a new land category.   
INPUT OF BIOMASS TO DEAD ORGANIC MATTER 
Whenever a tree is felled, non-merchantable and non-commercial components (such as tops, branches, leaves, 
roots, and non-commercial trees) are left on the ground and transferred to dead organic matter pools. In addition, 
annual mortality can add substantial amounts of dead wood to that pool. For Tier 1 methods, the assumption is 
that the carbon contained in all biomass components that are transferred to dead organic matter pools will be 
released in the year of the transfer, whether from annual processes (litterfall and tree mortality), land management 
activities, fuelwood gathering, or disturbances. For estimation procedures based on higher Tiers, it is necessary to 
estimate the amount of biomass carbon that is transferred to dead organic matter. The quantity of biomass 
transferred to DOM is estimated using Equation 2.20.

C), are released to the atmosphere in the case of fire (cell F) and, if salvage follows the 
disturbance, transferred to HWP (cell E). 
Note: If root biomass increments are counted in Equation 2.10, then root biomass losses must also be counted in 
Equations 2.20, and 2.22.

Examples of the terms on the right-hand side of Equation 2.20 are obtained as follows:  
Transfers to dead organic matter from mortality, L mor ta li ty 
Mortality is caused by competition during stand development, age, diseases, and other processes that are not 
included as disturbances. Mortality cannot be neglected when using higher Tier estimation methods. In extensively 
managed stands without periodic partial cuts, mortality from competition during the stem exclusion phase, may 
represent 30-50 percent of total productivity of a stand during its lifetime. In regularly tended stands, additions to 
the dead organic matter pool from mortality may be negligible because partial cuts extract forest biomass that 
would otherwise be lost to mortality and transferred to dead organic matter pools. Available data for increment 
will normally report net annual increment, which is defined as net of losses from mortality. Since in this text, net 
annual growth is used as a basis to estimate biomass gains, mortality must not be subtracted again as a loss from 
biomass pools. Mortality must, however, be counted as an addition to the dead wood pool for Tier 2 and Tier 3 
methods.  
The equation for estimating mortality is provided in Equation 2.21:

When data on mortality rates are expressed as proportion of growing stock volume, then the term Gw in Equation 
2.21 should be replaced with growing stock volume to estimate annual transfer to DOM pools from mortality. 
Mortality rates differ between stages of stand development and are highest during the stem exclusion phase of 
stand development. They also differ with stocking level, forest type, management intensity and disturbance history. 
Thus, providing default values for an entire climatic zone is not justified because the variation within a zone will 
be much larger than the variation between zones. 
Annual carbon transfer to slash, Lsl as h 
This involves estimating the quantity of slash left after wood removal or fuelwood removal and transfer of biomass 
from total annual carbon loss due to wood harvest (Equation 2.12). The estimate for logging slash is given in

Fuelwood gathering that involves the removal of live tree parts does not generate any additional input of biomass

Inventories using higher Tier methods can also estimate the amount of logging slash remaining after harvest by 
defining the proportion of above-ground biomass that is left after harvest (enter these proportions in cells B and 
C of Table 2.2 for harvest disturbance) and by using the approach defined in Equation 2.14. In this approach, 
activity data for the area harvested would also be required.  
2.3.2.2 LAND CONVERSION TO A NEW LAND-USE CATEGORY 
The reporting convention is that all carbon stock changes and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions associated with 
a land-use change be reported in the new land-use category. For example, in the case of conversion of Forest Land 
to Cropland, both the carbon stock changes associated with the clearing of the forest as well as any subsequent 
carbon stock changes that result from the conversion are reported under the Cropland category. 
The Tier 1 assumption is that DOM pools in non-forest land categories after the conversion are zero, i.e., they 
contain no carbon. The Tier 1 assumption for land converted from forest to another land-use category is that all 
DOM carbon losses occur in the year of land-use conversion. Conversely, conversion to Forest Land results in 
build-up of litter and dead wood carbon pools starting from zero carbon in those pools. DOM carbon gains on land 
converted to forest occur linearly, starting from zero, over a transition period (default assumption is 20 years). This 
default period may be appropriate for litter carbon stocks, but in temperate and boreal regions it is probably too 
short for dead wood carbon stocks. Countries that use higher Tier methods can accommodate longer transition 
periods by subdividing the remaining category to accommodate strata that are in the later stages of transition.  
The estimation of carbon stock changes during transition periods following land-use conversion requires that 
annual cohorts of the area subject to land-use change be tracked for the duration of the transition period. For 
example, DOM stocks are assumed to increase for 20 years after conversion to Forest Land. After 20 years, the 
area converted enters the category Forest Land Remaining Forest Land, and no further DOM changes are assumed, 
if a Tier 1 approach is applied. Under Tier 2 and 3, the period of conversion can be varied depending on vegetation 
and other factors that determine the time required for litter and dead wood pools to reach steady state. 
Higher Tier estimation methods can use non-zero estimates of litter and dead wood pools in the appropriate land-
use categories or subcategories. For example, settlements and agro-forestry systems can contain some litter and 
dead wood pools, but because management, site conditions, and many other factors influence the pool sizes, no 
global default values can be provided here. Higher Tier methods may also estimate the details of dead organic 
matter inputs and outputs associated with the land-use change. 
The conceptual approach to estimating changes in carbon stocks in dead wood and litter pools is to estimate the 
difference in C stocks in the old and new land-use categories and to apply this change in the year of the conversion 
(carbon losses), or to distribute it uniformly over the length of the transition period (carbon gains) Equation 2.23:

Inventories using a Tier 1 method assume that all carbon contained in biomass killed during a land-use conversion 
event (less harvested products that are removed) is emitted directly to the atmosphere and none is added to dead 
wood and litter pools. Tier 1 methods also assume that dead wood and litter pool carbon losses occur entirely in 
the year of the transition.  
Countries using higher Tier methods can modify Co in Equation 2.23 by first accounting for the immediate effects 
of the land-use conversion in the year of the event. In this case, they would add to Co the carbon from biomass 
killed and transferred to the dead wood and litter pools and remove from Co any carbon released from dead wood 
and litter pools, e.g., during slash burning. In that case Co in Equation 2.23 would represent the dead wood or litter 
carbon stocks immediately after the land-use conversion. Co will transit to Cn over the transition period, using 
linear or more complex dynamics. A disturbance matrix (Table 2.1) can be defined to account for the pool 
transitions and releases during the land-use conversion, including the additions and removals to Co. 
Countries using a Tier 1 approach can apply the Tier 1 default carbon stock estimates for litter, and if available 
dead wood pools, provided in Table 2.2, but should recognize that these are broad-scale estimates with 
considerable uncertainty when applied at the country level. Table 2.2 is incomplete because of the paucity of 
published data. A review of the literature has identified several problems. The IPCC definitions of dead organic 
matter carbon stocks include litter and dead wood. The litter pool contains all litter plus fine woody debris up to a 
diameter limit of 10 cm (see Chapter 1, Table 1.1). Published litter data generally do not include the fine woody 
debris component, so the litter values in Table 2.2 are incomplete.  
There are numerous published studies of coarse woody debris (Harmon and Hua, 1991; Karjalainen and 
Kuuluvainen, 2002) and a few review papers (e.g., Harmon et al., 1986), and but to date only two studies are found 
to provide regional dead wood carbon pool estimates that are based on sample plot data.  Krankina et al. (2002) 
included several regions in Russia and reported coarse woody debris (> 10 cm diameter) estimates of 2 to 7 Mg C 
ha-1. Cooms et al. (2002) reported regional carbon pools based on a statistical sample design for a small region in 
New Zealand. Regional compilations for Canada (Shaw et al., 2005) provide estimates of litter carbon pools based 
on a compilation of statistically non-representative sample plots, but do not include estimates of dead wood pools. 
Review papers such as Harmon et al. (1986) compile a number of estimates from the literature. For example, their 
Table 5 lists a range of coarse woody debris values for temperate deciduous forests of 11 – 38 Mg dry matter ha-1 
and for temperate coniferous forests of 10 – 511 Mg dry matter ha-1. It is, however, statistically invalid to calculate 
a mean from these compilations as they are not representative samples of the dead wood pools in a region. 
While it is the intent of these IPCC Guidelines to provide default values for all variables used in Tier 1 
methodologies, it is currently not feasible to provide estimates of regional defaults values for litter (including fine 
woody debris < 10 cm diameter) and dead wood (> 10 cm diameter) carbon stocks. Litter pool estimates (excluding 
fine woody debris) are provided in Table 2.2. Tier 1 methodology only requires the estimates in Table 2.2 for lands 
converted from Forest Land to any other land-use category (carbon losses) and for lands converted to Forest Land 
(carbon gains). Tier 1 methods assume that litter and dead wood pools are zero in all non-forest categories and 
therefore transitions between non-forest categories involve no carbon stock changes in these two pools.

Change in carbon stocks in soils  
Although both organic and inorganic forms of C are found in soils, land use and management typically has a larger 
impact on organic C stocks. Consequently, the methods provided in these guidelines focus mostly on soil organic 
C. Overall, the influence of land use and management on soil organic C is dramatically different in a mineral 
versus an organic soil type. Organic (e.g., peat and muck) soils have a minimum of 12 percent organic C by mass 
(see Chapter 3 Annex 3A.5, for the specific criteria on organic soil classification), and develop under poorly 
drained conditions of wetlands (Brady & Weil 1999). All other soils are classified as mineral soil types, and 
typically have relatively low amounts of organic matter, occurring under moderate to well drained conditions, and 
predominate in most ecosystems except wetlands. Discussion about land-use and management influences on these 
contrasting soil types is provided in the next two sections. 
MINERAL SOILS 
Mineral soils contain an organic carbon pool that is influenced by land-use and management activities. Land use 
can have a large effect on the size of this pool through activities such as conversion of native Grassland and Forest 
Land to Cropland, where 20-40 percent of the original soil C stocks can be lost (Mann 1986; Davidson & 
Ackerman 1993; Ogle et al. 2005). Within a land-use type, a variety of management practices can also have a 
significant impact on soil organic C storage, particularly in Cropland and Grassland (e.g., Paustian et al. 1997; 
Conant et al. 2001; Ogle et al. 2004 and 2005).  In principle, soil organic C stocks can change with management 
or disturbance if the net balance between C inputs and C losses from soil is altered. Management activities 
influence organic C inputs through changes in plant production (such as fertilisation or irrigation to enhance crop 
growth), direct additions of C in organic amendments, and the amount of carbon left after biomass removal 
activities, such as crop harvest, timber harvest, fire, or grazing. Decomposition largely controls C outputs and can 
be influenced by changes in moisture and temperature regimes as well as the level of soil disturbance resulting 
from the management activity. Other factors also influence decomposition, such as climate and edaphic 
characteristics. Specific effects of different land-use conversions and management regimes are discussed in the 
land-use specific chapters (Chapters 4 to 9). 
Land-use change and management activity can also influence soil organic C storage by changing erosion rates and 
subsequent loss of C from a site; some eroded C decomposes in transport and CO2 is returned to the atmosphere, 
while the remainder is deposited in another location. The net effect of changing soil erosion through land 
management is highly uncertain, however, because an unknown portion of eroded C is stored in buried sediments 
of wetlands, lakes, river deltas and coastal zones (Smith et al. 2001). 
ORGANIC SOILS 
No refinement. See Chapter 2, Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of the 2013 Wetlands Supplement. 
2.3.3.1 SOIL ORGANIC C ESTIMATION METHODS (LAND REMAINING 
IN A LAND-USE CATEGORY AND LAND CONVERSION TO A NEW 
LAND USE) 
Soil C inventories include estimates of soil organic C stock changes for mineral soils and CO2 emissions from 
organic soils due to enhanced microbial decomposition caused by drainage and associated management activity. 
In addition, inventories can address C stock changes for soil inorganic C pools (e.g., calcareous grassland that 
become acidified over time) if sufficient information is available to use a Tier 3 approach. The equation for 
estimating the total change in soil C stocks is given in Equation 2.24:

For Tier 1 methods, soil organic C stocks for mineral soils are computed to a default depth of 30 cm because 
default reference soil organic C stocks (SOCREF – see Equation 2.25 and Table 2.3) and stock change factors (e.g. 
FLU, FMG and FI see Equation 2.25) are based on a 30 cm depth. In addition, the reference condition is defined as 
that present in native lands (i.e. non-degraded, unimproved lands under native vegetation) for the default reference 
soil organic C stocks (SOCREF). For Tier 2, a different reference condition and depth can be used as described in 
the section on Tier 2 methods. Residue/litter C stocks are not included in Tier 1 because they are addressed by 
estimating dead organic matter stocks (see section 2.3.2). Inventories can also estimate the change in mineral soil 
organic C stock due to biochar amendments to soils (Tier 2 and Tier 3 only). Stock changes in organic soils are 
based on emission factors that represent the annual loss of organic C throughout the profile due to drainage and 
associated management activity.  
No Tier 1 or 2 methods are provided for estimating the change in soil inorganic C stocks (∆𝐶𝐼𝑙���𝑙���𝑟𝑔𝑎𝑙���𝑖𝑐) due to 
limited scientific data for derivation of stock change factors; thus, the net flux for inorganic C stocks is assumed 
to be zero. Tier 3 methods could be developed to estimate changes in the stock of inorganic carbon in mineral or 
organic soils.  
It is possible that compilers will use different tiers to prepare estimates for mineral soils, organic soils, biochar 
amendments and soil inorganic C, depending on the availability of resources. Thus, stock changes are discussed 
separately for organic carbon in mineral and organic soils and for inorganic C pools (Tier 3 only). Generalised 
decision trees in Figures 2.4 and 2.5 can be used to assist inventory compilers in determining the appropriate tier 
for estimating stock changes for mineral and organic soil C, respectively.

Tier 1 – Default Method 
Mineral soils 
For mineral soils, the stock change factor method is based on changes in soil C stocks (∆𝐶𝑀𝑖𝑙���𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙) over a finite 
period of time of 20 years (Equation 2.25). The change in organic C stock in mineral soil (𝑅���𝑂𝐶𝑀𝑖𝑙���𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙) is computed 
by calculating the organic C stock remaining after a management change relative to the organic C stock in a 
reference condition and summing this change over all climate zones, soil types and management practices included 
in the inventory. The soil organic C stock present under the reference condition for the Tier 1 method is defined 
as that in non-degraded, unimproved lands under native vegetation (Table 2.3). The following assumptions are 
made: 
(i) 
Over time, soil organic C stock reaches a spatially-averaged, stable value specific to the soil, climate, 
land-use and management practices; and  
(ii) 
Soil organic C stock change during the transition to a new equilibrium SOC occurs in a linear fashion 
over a period of 20 years. 
Assumption (i), that under a given set of climate and management conditions soils tend towards an equilibrium 
organic C stock, is widely accepted.  Although, soil organic C stock changes in response to management changes 
may often be best described by a curvilinear function, assumption (ii) greatly simplifies the Tier 1 methodology 
and provides a good approximation over a multi-year inventory period, where changes in management and land-
use conversions are occurring throughout the inventory period.

Using the default method, changes in mineral soil organic C stocks are computed over an inventory time period.  
Inventory time periods will likely be established based on the years in which activity data are collected, such as 
1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010, which would correspond to inventory time periods of 1990-1995, 1995-2000, 
2000-2005, 2005-2010. For each inventory time period, the soil organic C stocks are estimated for the first (SOC0-T) 
and last year (SOC0) based on multiplying the reference C stocks by stock change factors. Annual rates of carbon 
stock change are estimated as the difference in stocks at two points in time divided by the time dependence of the 
stock change factors.

Inventory calculations are based on land areas that are stratified by climate regions (see Chapter 3 Annex 3A.5, 
for default classification of climate), and default soils types as shown in Table 2.3 (see Chapter 3, Annex 3A.5, for 
default classification of soils). The stock change factors are very broadly defined and include: 1) a land-use factor 
(FLU) that reflects C stock changes associated with type of land use, 2) a management factor (FMG) representing 
the principal management practice specific to the land-use sector (e.g., different tillage practices in cropland), and 
3) an input factor (FI) representing different levels of C input to soil. As mentioned above, FND is substituted for 
FLU in Forest Land to account for the influence of natural disturbance regimes (see Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3 for 
more discussion). The stock change factors are provided in the soil C sections of the land-use chapters. Each of 
these factors represents the change over a specified number of years (D), which can vary across sectors, but is 
typically invariant within sectors (e.g., 20 years for the cropland systems). In some inventories, the time period for 
inventory (T years) may exceed D, and under those cases, an annual rate of change in C stock may be obtained by 
dividing the product of [(SOC0 – SOC(0 –T)) ● A] by T, instead of D. See the soil C sections in the land-use chapters 
for detailed step-by-step guidance on the application of this method. 
When applying the stock change factor method using Equation 2.25, the type of land-use and management activity 
data has a direct influence on the formulation of the equation (See Box 2.1). Formulation A is based on activity 
data collected with Approach 1, while Formulation B is based on activity data collected with Approaches 2 or 3 
(Box 2.1). See Chapter 3 for additional discussion on the approaches for activity data collection. 
Special consideration is needed if using Approach 1 activity data (see Chapter 3) as the basis for estimating land-
use and management effects on soil C stocks, using Equation 2.25. Approach 1 data do not track individual land 
transitions, and so SOC stock changes are computed for inventory time periods equivalent to D years, or as close 
as possible to D, which is 20 years in the Tier 1 method. For example, Cropland may be converted from full tillage 
to no-till management between 1990 and 1995, and Formulation A (see Box 2.1) would estimate a gain in soil C 
for that inventory time period. However, assuming that the same parcel of land remains in no-till between 1995 
and 2000, no additional gain in C would be computed (i.e., the stock for 1995 would be based on no-till 
management and it would not differ from the stock in 2000 (SOC0), which is also based on no-till management). 
If using the default approach, there would be an error in this estimation because the change in soil C stocks occurs 
over 20 years (i.e., D = 20 years). Therefore, SOC(0 –T) is estimated for the most distant time that is used in the 
inventory calculations up to D years before the last year in the inventory time periods (SOC0). For example, 
assuming D is 20 years and the inventory is based on activity data from 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010, SOC(0 
–T) will be computed for 1990 to estimate the change in soil organic C for each of the other years, (i.e., 1995, 2000, 
2005 and 2010). The year for estimating SOC(0 –T) in this example will not change until activity data are gathered 
at 2011 or later (e.g., computing the C stock change for 2011 would be based on the most distant year up to, but 
not exceeding D, which in this example would be 1995).  
If transition matrices are available (i.e., Approach 2 or 3 activity data), the changes can be estimated between each 
successive year. From the example above, some no-till land may be returned to full tillage management between 
1995 and 2000. In this case, the gain in C storage between 1990 and 1995 for the land base returned to full tillage 
would need to be discounted between 1995 and 2000.  Further, no additional change in the C stocks would be 
necessary for land returned to full tillage after 2000 (assuming tillage management remained the same).  Only land 
remaining in no-till would continue to gain C up to 2010 (i.e., assuming D is 20 years). Hence, inventories using 
transition matrices from Approach 2 and 3 activity data will need to be more careful in dealing with the time 
periods over which gains or losses of SOC are computed.  See Box 2.2 for additional details.  The application of 
the soil C estimation approach is much simpler if only using aggregated statistics with Approach 1 activity data. 
However, it is good practice for countries to use transition matrices from Approach 2 and 3 activity data if that 
information is available because the more detailed statistics will provide an improved estimate of annual changes 
in soil organic C stocks. 
There may be some cases in which activity data are collected over time spans longer than the time dependence of 
the stock change factors (D), such as every 30 years with a D of 20. For those cases, the annual stock changes can 
be estimated directly between each successive year of activity data collection (e.g., 1990, 2020 and 2050) without 
over- or under-estimating the annual change rate, as long as T is substituted for D in Equation 2.25.

Where: 
p = a parcel of land representing an individual unit of area over which the inventory calculations are 
performed.  
See the description of other terms under the Equation 2.25. 
Activity data may only be available using Approach 1 for data collection (Chapter 3).  These data 
provide the total area at two points in time for climate, soil and land-use/management systems, 
without quantification of the specific transitions in land use and management over the inventory time 
period (i.e., only the aggregate or net change is known, not the gross changes in activity).  With 
Approach 1 activity data, mineral C stock changes are computed using formulation A of Equation 
2.25.  In contrast, activity data may be collected based on surveys, remote sensing imagery or other 
data providing not only the total areas for each land management system, but also the specific 
transitions in land use and management over time on individual parcels of land.  These are considered 
Approach 2 and 3 activity data in Chapter 3, and soil C stock changes are computed using 
formulation B of Equation 2.25.  Formulation B contains a summation by land parcel (i.e., "p" 
represents land parcels in formulation B rather than the set of management systems “i”) that allows 
the inventory compiler to compute the changes in C stocks on a land parcel by land parcel basis.

This box examines the application of Equation 2.25 to calculate ∆𝐶𝑙���𝑖𝑙���𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙. Assume a country where 
a fraction of the land is subjected to land-use changes, as shown in the following table, where each 
line represents one land unit with an area of 1 Mha (F = Forest Land; C = Cropland; G = Grassland).  
Where a land-use change occurs, it is assumed to occur in the year following the previous inventory 
year (e.g. for land unit 1, the conversion from F to C occurred at the start of 1991 such that for the 
five years from the start of 1991 to the end of the 1995 inventory year the land was under land-use

For simplicity, it is assumed that the country has a single soil type, with a SOCREF (0-30 cm soil 
C stock under native forest vegetation) value of 77 tonnes C ha-1. Values for FLU are 1.00, 1.05 
and 0.92 for F, G and C, respectively. FMG and FI are assumed to be equal to 1. The time 
dependence of the stock change factors (D) is 20 years. Finally, the soil C stock is assumed to 
be at equilibrium in 1990 (i.e., no changes in land-use occurred during the 20 years prior to 
1990).  When using Approach 1 activity data (i.e., aggregate statistical data), annual changes in 
C stocks are computed for every inventory year following Equation 2.25 above. The following

BOX 2.2 (UPDATED) (CONTINUED) 
COMPARISON BETWEEN USE OF APPROACH 1 AGGREGATE STATISTICS AND APPROACH 2 OR 3 ACTIVITY DATA 
WITH TRANSITION MATRICES 
Both methods yield different estimates of C stocks, and use of Approach 2 or 3 data with land 
transition matrices would be more accurate than use of Approach 1 aggregate statistics. However, 
estimates of annual changes of C stocks would not differ greatly, as shown in this example. The 
effect of underlying data approaches on the estimates differ more when there are multiple changes 
in land-use on the same piece of land (as in land units 2, 3 and 6 in the example). It is noteworthy 
that Approach 1, 2 and 3 activity data produce the same changes in C stocks if the systems reach a 
new equilibrium, which occurs with no change in land-use and management for a 20-year time 
period using the Tier 1 method.  Consequently, no C stock increases or losses are inadvertently lost 
when applying the methods for Approach 1, 2 or 3 activity data, but the temporal dynamics do vary 
somewhat as demonstrated above. A spreadsheet is available with the full set of calculations:

Tier 2 Methods 
Mineral soils 
A Tier 2 method is an extension of the Tier 1 method that allows an inventory to incorporate country-specific data. 
It is good practice for countries to use a Tier 2 method, if possible, even if they are only able to better specify 
certain components of the Tier 1 method. For example, a compiler may only have data to derive country-specific 
reference C stocks, which would then be used with default stock change factors to estimate changes in soil organic 
C stocks for mineral soils. 
Country-specific data can be used to improve four components when applying the Tier 1 equations for estimating 
stock changes in mineral soils. The components include a) derivation of region or country-specific stock change 
factors, b) reference condition C stocks, c) specification of management systems, and/or d) classification of climate 
and soil categories (e.g., Ogle et al., 2003; VandenBygaart et al., 2004; Tate et al., 2005). Inventory compilers can 
choose to derive specific values for all of these components, or any subset, which would be combined with default 
values provided in the Tier 1 method to complete the inventory calculations using Equation 2.25. Also, the Tier 2 
method uses the same procedural steps for calculations as provided for Tier 1.  
1) Defining management systems. Although the same management systems may be used in a Tier 2 inventory as 
found in the Tier 1 method, the default systems can be disaggregated into a finer categorisation that better 
represents management impacts on soil organic C stocks in a particular country based on empirical data (i.e., stock 
change factors vary significantly for the proposed management systems).  Such an undertaking, however, is only 
possible if there is sufficient detail in the underlying data to classify the land area into the finer, more detailed set 
of management systems. 
2) Climate regions and soil types. Countries that have detailed soil classifications and climatic data have the option 
of developing country-specific classifications. Moreover, it is considered good practice to specify better climate 
regions and soil types during the development of a Tier 2 inventory if the new classification improves the 
specification of reference C stocks and/or stock change factors. In practice, reference C stocks and/or stock change 
factors should differ significantly among the proposed climate regions and soil types based on an empirical analysis. 
Note that specifying new climate regions and/or soil types requires the derivation of country-specific reference C 
stocks and stock change factors. The default reference soil C stocks and stock change factors are only appropriate 
for inventories using the default climate and soil types. 
3) Reference C stocks. Deriving country-specific reference condition soil C stocks (SOCREF) is another possibility 
for improving an inventory using a Tier 2 method (Bernoux et al. 2002), which will likely produce more accurate 
and representative values. Country-specific stocks can be estimated from soil measurements, for example, as part 
of a country’s soil survey. It is important that reliable taxonomic descriptions be used to group soils into categories. 
Three additional points require consideration when deriving the country-specific values, including possible 
specification of country-specific soil categories and climate regions (i.e., instead of using the IPCC default 
classification), choice of reference condition, and choice of depth increment over which the stocks are estimated. 
 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.39 
Stocks are computed by multiplying the proportion of organic C (i.e., %C divided by 100) by the depth increment 
(default is 30 cm), bulk density, and the proportion of coarse-fragment free soil (i.e., < 2mm fragments) in the 
depth increment (Ogle et al. 2003).  The coarse fragment-free proportion is on a mass basis (i.e., mass of coarse 
fragment-free soil/total mass of the soil). If the soil C reference condition differs from that used in Table 2.3 or the 
soil depth used differs from 30 cm, then appropriate country specific soil C stocks for the reference condition and 
stock change factors must be derived. For developing a Tier 2 method, it would also be possible to define reference 
SOC stocks and SOC stock change factors using an equivalent mass approach (see Box 2.2b) rather than an 
approach based on a fixed depth. 
The soil reference condition is the land-use/cover category (or condition within a land-use/cover category) that is 
used for evaluating the relative effect of land-use change on the amount of soil C storage (e.g., relative difference 
in soil C storage between a reference condition, such as native lands, and another land use, such as cropland, 
forming the basis for FLU in Equation 2.25). It is likely that many countries will use the Tier 1 default soil reference 
condition in a Tier 2 method. However, another land use or condition can be selected to define the reference 
condition, which is good practice if it allows for a more accurate assessment of soil C stock changes.  The same 
reference condition should be used for each climate zone and soil type, regardless of the land use. The soil C stock 
associated with the reference condition is then multiplied by land use, input and management factors to estimate 
the stocks at the beginning and last year in an inventory time period (See Equation 2.25). 
Another consideration in deriving country-specific reference soil C stocks is the possibility of estimating C stocks 
to a different depth in the soil. Default soil C stocks given in Table 2.3 are based on the amount of soil organic C 
in the top 30 cm of a soil profile. A different depth can be selected and used for Tier 2 methods if all appropriate 
data are available. Consideration should be given to the introduction of bias (positive or negative) that may arise 
in response to the depth selected. For example, where depth is set to 20 cm and cultivation mixes soils to a 
depth >20 cm, an apparent difference in SOC stock between cultivated and uncultivated soils may be observed for 
the 20cm depth that is not representative of the change in SOC stocks to the depth over which mixing occurs in 
the cultivated soil. It is good practice to derive reference condition soil C stocks to the depth at which land use and 
management impact soil C stocks, but this will require that the data are available or could be acquired to the 
selected depth. Any change in the depth for reference condition soil C stocks will require derivation of new stock 
change factors (e.g. FLU, FMG and FI see Equation 2.25) consistent with the depth selected because the defaults are 
based on impacts to a 30 cm depth.   
It is possible to use a soil C model to derive steady state soil C stocks indicative of the soil reference condition for 
the various combinations of soil type and climate that exist within a country. However, this would require sufficient 
testing of the model used to provide evidence that the model is adequate for this purpose (See Section 2.5.2 for 
more information). Further information related to soil sampling strategies and how to derive soil reference C stocks 
can be found in Batjes (2011), as well as in a range of soil sampling and analysis texts (e.g. Carter & Gregorich 
2008; de Gruijter et al. 2006) 
4) Stock change factors. An important advancement for a Tier 2 method is the estimation of country-specific stock 
change factors (FLU, FMG and FI). The derivation of country-specific factors can be accomplished using 
experimental/measurement data and computer model simulation. In practice, deriving stock change factors 
involves estimating a response ratio for each study or observation (i.e., the C stocks in different input or 
management classes are divided by the value for the nominal practice, respectively). 
Optimally, stock change factors are based on experimental/measurement data in the country or surrounding region, 
by estimating the response ratios from each study and then analysing those values using an appropriate statistical 
technique (e.g., Ogle et al. 2003 and 2004; VandenBygaart et al. 2004). Studies may be found in published 
literature, reports and other sources, or inventory compilers may choose to conduct new experiments.  Regardless 
of the data source, it is good practice that the plots being compared have similar histories and management as well 
as similar topographic position, soil physical properties and be located in close proximity.  Studies should provide 
soil C stocks (i.e., mass per unit area to a specified depth) or the information needed to calculate soil C stocks (i.e., 
percent organic carbon together with bulk density; proportion of rock in soil, which is often measured as the greater 
than 2mm fraction and by definition contains negligible soil organic C). If percent organic matter is available 
instead of percent organic carbon, a conversion factor of 0.58 can be used to estimate the C content. Moreover, it 
is good practice that the measurements of soil C stocks are taken on an equivalent mass basis (e.g., Ellert et al. 
2001; Gifford & Roderick, 2003). In order to use this method, the inventory compiler will need to determine a 
depth to measure the C stock for the nominal land use or practice, such as native lands or conventional tillage. This 
depth will need to be consistent with the depth for the reference C stocks. The soil C stock for the land-use or 
management change is then measured to a depth with the equivalent mass of soil.  Box 2.2b provides further 
information on issues associated with conducting an inventory on an equivalent mass basis. 
Another option for deriving country-specific values is to simulate stock change factors from advanced models 
(Bhatti et al., 2001). To demonstrate the use of advanced models, simulated stock change factors can be compared 
to with measured changes in C stocks from experiments. It is good practice to provide the results of model 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.40 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
evaluation, citing published papers in the literature and/or placing the results in the inventory report. This approach 
is considered a Tier 2 method because it relies on the stock change factor concept and the C estimation method 
elaborated in the Tier 1 method.   
Derivation of country-specific management factors (FMG) and input factors (FI), either with empirical data or 
advanced models, will need to be consistent with the management system classification.  If more systems are 
specified for the inventory, unique factors will need to be derived representing the finer categories for a particular 
land use.   
Another consideration in deriving country-specific stock change factors is their associated time dependence (D in 
Equation 2.25), which determines the number of years over which the majority of a soil C stock change occurs, 
following a management change.  It is possible to use the default time dependence (D) for the land-use sector (e.g., 
20 years for cropland), but the dependence can be changed if sufficient data are available to justify a different time 
period. In addition, the method is designed to use the same time dependence (D) for all stock change factors as 
presented in Equation 2.25. If different periods are selected for FLU, FMG and FI, it will be necessary to compute 
the influence of land use, management and inputs separately and divide the associated stock change dependence. 
This can be accomplished by modifying Equation 2.25 so that SOC at time T and 0-T is computed individually for 
each of the stock change factors (i.e., SOC is computed with FLU only, then computed with FMG, and finally 
computed with FI). The differences are computed for the stocks associated with land use, management, and input, 
dividing by their respective D values, and then the changes are summed.  
Changes in soil C stocks normally occur in a non-linear fashion, and it is possible to further develop the time 
dependence of stock change factors to reflect this pattern. For changes in land use or management that cause a 
decrease in soil C content, the rate of change is highest during the first few years, and progressively declines with 
time. In contrast, when soil C is increasing due to land-use or management change, the rate of accumulation tends 
to follow a sigmoidal curve, with rates of change being slow at the beginning, then increasing and finally 
decreasing with time. If historical changes in land-use or management practices are explicitly tracked by re-
surveying the same locations (i.e., Approach 2 or 3 activity data, see Chapter 3), it may be possible to implement 
a Tier 2 method that incorporates the non-linearity of changes in soil C stock.  
BOX 2.2A (NEW) 
USING EQUIVALENT MASS METHODS TO DERIVE MINERAL SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STOCK CHANGE FACTORS 
Soil carbon stock estimates may be improved when deriving country-specific factors for FLU and FMG, by 
expressing carbon stocks on a soil-mass equivalent basis rather than a soil-volume equivalent (i.e. fixed depth) 
basis. This is because the soil mass to a certain soil depth changes in response to altered management practices 
associated with land use change (e.g. uprooting forest vegetation, land levelling, and rain compaction due to 
the disappearance of the cover of tree canopy). In addition, soil bulk density may be affected differently by 
particular management practices within a given land use (e.g. tillage and machinery traffic within cropping 
systems or the extent of compaction induced by different animal at stocking rates within pasture systems). 
Where the soil bulk density changes due to land use and/or management, the comparison of the soil carbon 
stocks between the cropland, settlements, grassland, wetlands, or forest land to the same depth introduces 
changes to soil carbon stocks as a direct consequence of changes in soil bulk density (Ellert & Bettany 1995).  
With a management induced change in soil bulk density, it is possible to calculate a change in soil carbon stock 
to a fixed depth in the absence of any change in soil carbon content.  Therefore, it is more robust to calculate 
soil carbon stock change on an equivalent mass basis rather than on a fixed-depth basis (Toriyama et al. 2011; 
Bruun et al. 2013; Halvorson et al. 2016; Hu et al., 2016). The equivalent mass approach has more rigorous 
comparability when the bulk density between cropland, grassland, wetland, settlements and forest land is 
markedly different even if the site is within close proximity.  It is important to realise that comprehensive data 
of soil carbon concentration and soil bulk density would be required to derive stock change factors across all 
land uses.  The changing mass of organic carbon itself will affect the equivalent soil mass and therefore 
equivalent mass basis is not appropriate for organic soils.  There are proposals for methods based on only 
equivalent mass of the mineral soil portion (McBratney & Minasny 2010) that would reduce the effect of 
changing soil organic mass distorting the equivalent soil mass.  Adopting an equivalent-mass based carbon 
stock inventory requires thorough consideration of the challenges. 
The impact of biochar C amendments on mineral soils can also be estimated with a Tier 2 method for mineral soils 
using Equation 2.25A and adding this estimate to the result in Equation 2.25.7

Country-specific values the C content of the forms of biochar included in the inventory (

specific values may also be based on published data on carbon content of biochar produced using the same 
feedstock and process conditions as the biochar that is applied to soils in the country.  
The fraction of biochar C remaining after 100 years is defined by the parameter 
Fpermp
. It is not possible to measure 
this value directly due to the time scales involved. So, this parameter is estimated from other data. The elemental 
composition of biochar, specifically the ratio of hydrogen to organic carbon (H/Corg) or ratio of oxygen to organic 
carbon (O/Corg), has been shown to correlate non-linearly with biochar residence time (Spokas 2010; Lehmann et 
al. 2015). Therefore, country-specific Tier 2 estimates of 
Fpermp
 can be based on H/Corg or O/Corg measured directly 
from representative samples of biochar, or from published data for biochar produced using similar process 
conditions as the biochar that is applied to soils in the country. This parameter can also be derived from the biochar 
elemental composition using published equations relating this composition to mean residence time or half-life (for 
example H/Corg, Lehmann et al. 2015; or O/Corg, Spokas 2010), and extrapolated to the permanence time frame 
assuming one-, two-, or three-pool exponential decay (Zimmerman 2010; Herath et al. 2015; Lehmann et al. 2015). 
A justification should be provided if a permanence time frame other than 100 years is used. 
Since the impact of biochar amendments is a separate calculation and summed with the result from Equation 2.25 
in the Tier 2 method, it is essential that biochar C is not included as an organic amendment in the estimates of 
SOCMineral
 in Equation 2.25. 
                                                           
gasification or pyrolysis process. This guidance does not deal with pyrolytic organic materials that result from wild fires or 
open fires, and is only applicable for biochar added to mineral soils.

GHG EMISSION SOURCES WITH BIOCHAR PRODUCTION 
Biochar production involves emissions from several different sectors and source categories. All 
GHG emissions and removals are reported in a greenhouse gas inventory, but estimation and 
reporting is done based on sources in which the activity occurs. The guidance in this section is 
addressing C stock changes associated with the end-product use of biochar amendments to mineral 
soils.  However, other emissions do occur along the biochar feedstock supply chains that are 
estimated in other source categories.  For example, the harvesting and use of forest wood biomass 
for biochar production would be part of reported C stock changes in Forest Land Remaining Forest 
Land (Volume 4).  Moreover, biomass may be grown specifically as a feedstock and the C stock 
changes are estimated and reported under the appropriate source categories for land use associated 
with feedstock production (Volume 4).  For plant residues and manures, their utilisation as feedstock 
reduces input of organic amendments to soil and thereby affects soil C stocks in cropland and 
grassland, and possibly other land uses receiving manure amendments (Volume 4).  For waste 
materials, their utilisation as feedstock reduces input to waste streams and is addressed in the 
calculation of emissions from waste management (Volume 5). There may also be use of fossil fuels 
in the harvesting, transport and pyrolysis of the feedstock and a potential release of other non-CO2 
greenhouse gases during the heating process that would be included in the energy sector (Volume 
2).

Soil inorganic C 
No refinement. 
Tier 3: Advanced estimation systems 
Tier 3 approaches for soil C involve the development of an advanced estimation system that will typically better 
capture annual variability in fluxes, unlike Tier 1 and 2 approaches that mostly assume a constant annual change 
in C stocks over an inventory time period based on a stock change factor. Essentially, Tiers 1 and 2 represent land-
use and management impacts on soil C stocks as a linear shift from one equilibrium state to another. To understand 
the implications better, it is important to note that soil C stocks typically do not exist in an absolute equilibrium 
state or change in a linear manner through a transition period, given that many of the driving variables affecting 
the stocks are dynamic, periodically changing at shorter time scales before a new “near” equilibrium is reached. 
Tier 3 approaches can address this non-linearity using more advanced models than Tiers 1 and 2 methods, and/or 
by developing a measurement-based inventory with a monitoring network. In addition, Tier 3 inventories are 
capable of capturing longer-term legacy effects of land use and management. In contrast, Tiers 1 and 2 approaches 
typically only address the most recent influence of land use and management, such as the last 20 years for mineral 
C stocks. See Section 2.5 (Generic Guidance for Tier 3 methods) for additional discussion on Tier 3 methods 
beyond the text given below. 
Mineral soils 
Model-based approaches can use mechanistic simulation models that capture the underlying processes driving 
carbon gains and losses from soils in a quantitative framework, such as the influence of land use and management 
on processes controlling carbon input resulting from plant production and litter fall as well as microbial 
decomposition (e.g., McGill, 1996; Smith et al., 1997b; Smith et al., 2000; Falloon and Smith, 2002; Tate et al., 
2005; Campbell&Paustian, 2015). Note that Tier 3 methods provide the only current opportunity to explicitly 
estimate the impact of soil erosion on C fluxes (Box 2.2d). In addition, Tier 3 model-based approaches may 
represent C transfers between biomass, dead biomass and soils, which are advantageous for ensuring conservation 
of mass in predictions of C stock changes in these pools relative to CO2 removals and emissions to the atmosphere. 
Tier 3 modelling approaches are capable of addressing the influence of land use and management with a dynamic 
representation of environmental conditions that affect the processes controlling soil C stocks, such as weather, 
edaphic characteristics, and other variables. The impact of land use and management on soil C stocks can vary as 
environmental conditions change, and such changes are not captured in lower Tiers, which may create biases in 
those results. Tier 3 methods can also include lateral flows of C associated with erosion and deposition (See Box 
2.2c). Consequently, Tier 3 approaches are capable of providing a more accurate estimation of C stock changes 
associated with land-use and management activity if the modelling approach has been calibrated to the range of 
environmental conditions, soil properties and management practices to which the model will subsequently be 
applied (See Section 2.5 for more information).

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.43 
For Tier 3 approaches, a set of benchmark sites will be needed to evaluate model results. Ideally, a series of 
permanent, benchmark monitoring sites would be established with statistically replicated design, capturing the 
major climatic regions, soil types, and management systems as well as system changes, and would allow for 
repeated measurements of soil organic C stocks over time (Smith, 2004a).  Monitoring is based on re-sampling 
plots every 3 to 5 years or each decade; shorter sampling frequencies are not likely to produce significant 
differences due to small annual changes in C stocks relative to the large total amount of C in a soil (IPCC, 2000; 
Smith, 2004b).  
BOX 2.2C (NEW) 
REPRESENTING THE IMPACT OF SOIL EROSION AND DEPOSITION ON SOIL CARBON STOCK CHANGES 
Soil erosion and/or deposition can have marked effect on measured carbon stocks (Chappell et al. 
2016).  Soil carbon stock changes due to soil erosion/deposition are not considered to be embedded 
in factors for land-use change or land management.  In practice, it is difficult to determine whether 
soil erosion/deposition effects are or are not included in stock change factors derived from empirical 
data.  Different land use changes and subsequent management practices could result in different 
extents of soil movement. For example, land-use change from forest or grassland to cropland, or 
land management change from no-till to full tillage are typically associated with increased soil 
movement.  The amounts of soil erosion or deposition are rarely measured or documented in datasets 
that have quantified soil carbon stock changes.   
One option to include the effects of soil erosion and deposition is using well-tested models that 
capture these dynamics with required input data to make estimates of the effect of past 
erosion/deposition on soil carbon stocks (Van Oost et al. 2005; Causarano et al. 2007).  However, 
use of such models also requires having empirical data on erosion/deposition effects on carbon 
stocks for evaluation of the model predictions. Another option is to consistently apply a rationale 
that identifies measured data of soil carbon stock changes that are affected by erosion/deposition for 
the development of Tier 2 or 3 methods, developing factors related to erosion/deposition impacts, 
and then applying these factors in areas affected by erosion/deposition.  
In addition to model-based approaches, Tier 3 methods afford the opportunity to develop a measurement-based 
inventory using a similar monitoring network as needed for model evaluation. However, measurement networks, 
which serve as the basis for a complete inventory, will have a considerably larger sampling density to minimise 
uncertainty, and to represent all management systems and associated land-use changes, across all climatic regions 
and major soil types (Sleutel et al., 2003; Lettens et al., 2004). Measurement networks can be based on soil 
sampling at benchmark sites or flux tower networks. Flux towers, such as those using eddy covariance systems 
(Baldocchi et al., 2001), constitute a unique case in that they measure the net exchange of CO2 between the 
atmosphere and land surface. Thus, with respect to changes in C stocks for the soil pool, flux tower measurement 
networks are subject to the following caveats: 1) towers need to occur at a sufficient density to represent fluxes 
for the entire country; 2) flux estimates need to be attributed to individual land-use sectors and specific land-use 
and management activities; and 3) CO2 fluxes need to be further attributed to individual pools including stock 
changes in soils (also biomass and dead organic matter). Additional considerations about soil measurements are 
given in the previous section on Tier 2 methods for mineral soils (See stock change factor discussion).  
It is important to note that measurement-based inventories represent full C estimation approaches, addressing all 
influences on soil C stocks. Partial estimation of only land-use and management effects may be difficult, however. 
Examples in Box 2.2d provide illustrations of Tier 3 methods for estimating change in mineral soil C stocks, 
including information such as type of data required, brief description of the models and methods that are used to 
apply the models. For Tier 3 methods, it is important to calibrate and test models against field measurements that 
reflect the variability in climate, soil type and land use over which the model will be applied (See Section 2.5.2 
for more information). Application of the equivalent mass approach may be possible for calculating soil C stocks 
with Tier 3 models, and is discussed in Box 2.2e.

EXAMPLES OF TIER 3 MINERAL SOIL C STOCK CHANGE METHODS 
Four examples of Tier 3 model applications for soil organic C stock changes are elaborated in this 
section based on government reporting to the UNFCCC by the Australia, Finland, Japan and United 
States. 
Australia 
Australia has implemented a Tier 3 inventory approach based on the use of the FullCAM model 
(Richards 2001; Richards & Evans 2004) to estimate management induced changes in the stock of 
organic carbon held in the 0-30 cm soil depth layer over time.  Australian lands included in the 
inventory were allocated to forest land, cropland, grassland, deforested land, forest land converted 
to cropland and grassland, grassland converted to forest land, and land with sparse woody vegetation 
based on national land use mapping (ABARES 2016) and remote sensing protocols (Caccetta et al. 
2012)  Detailed presentations of the soil carbon accounting processes under all land uses can be 
found in the National Inventory Reports (NIR) (http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-
change/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/national-inventory-report-2015). 
 
Here 
a 
summary is provided of the Tier 3 approach as applied to soil organic carbon stocks for cropland 
and grassland. 
The FullCAM model simulates soil carbon stock change in 25m x 25m areas across Australia.  This 
size was selected as it represented the finest scale to which the remote sensing process (Caccetta et 
al. 2012; Tupek et al. 2016) can detect land use change and quantify movement of lands between 
the various classes included in the inventory.  The data requirements and processes used to quantify 
the impact of management on Australia’s 0-30 cm stock of soil organic carbon can be summarised 
as follows: 
1) Spatially explicit daily and monthly climatic data (average temperature, total rainfall and total 
pan evaporation) are extracted from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology database and then 
interpolated using thin plate smoothing splines according to (Kesteven & Lansberg 2004).  
Additionally, spatially explicit estimates of soil clay content and water holding capacity are 
extracted 
from 
the 
Soil 
and 
Landscape 
Grid 
of 
Australia 
(www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/soilandlandscapegrid/).  These data represent required inputs the 
modelling described in steps 4 and 5. 
2) The initial 0-30 cm total soil organic carbon stock is defined using a national map derived by 
Viscarra Rossel et al. (2014).  This total stock is then allocated to three measurable organic 
carbon fractions (particulate, humus and resistant forms) that provide estimates for the 
respective stocks of resistant plant material, humus and inert carbon required to initialize the 
FullCAM model (Baldock et al. 2013; Skjemstad et al. 2004; Viscarra Rossel & Hicks 2015).   
3) The types of crops and pastures grown, the applied management practices (e.g. tillage and 
residue management) and their relative allocations within defined land areas are calculated 
using national agricultural statistics derived from censuses conducted every five years

4) For the bulk of Australian crops and pastures, total growth is defined by the availability of water 
received as rainfall.  Thus, a plant growth model applying species specific transpiration 
efficiency terms to the amount of water made available to growing plants is used to estimate 
above ground dry matter production.  This production is then used along with plant species 
specific harvest indices (Unkovich et al. 2010) and root:shoot ratios to define the mass of carbon 
entering the soil and/or deposited on the soil surface for each monthly time step within the 
FullCAM simulation model.  Within irrigated systems, plant growth attains defined plant 
specific maximum values each year. 
5) The FullCAM model is then initialized and run on a monthly time step.  During each step, 
decomposition of decomposable and resistant plant materials and humus pools of C occurs 
according to first order decay equations. The values of the decomposition rate constants 
associated with the resistant plant material and humus pools of carbon within the model were 
calibrated to Australian conditions to the corresponding measured stocks of soil carbon fractions

5) (continued) of soil temperature  and water content on decomposition is modelled through the 
application of decomposition rate constant modifiers as done in the Rothamsted Carbon Model 
(RothC) soil carbon model (Jenkinson 1990). 
The impact of management on soil carbon stocks is quantified by running the described modelling 
process forward from 1970 under two scenarios.  In both scenarios, the same relative spatial 
allocation of regimes (combinations of crop or pasture species and management practice) is used 
from 1970 to 1990.  From 1990 onwards, the relative spatial allocation of regimes is held constant 
at 1990 values in the first scenario.  For the second scenario, the regimes are varied from 1991 
onwards to reflect the temporal variations in regimes defined within the available data.  The first 
scenario thus estimates the soil carbon stock that would have been attained with no change in 
management from that present in 1990; while the second scenario estimates the soil carbon stock 
attained when management changes over time are accounted for.  The net impact of management 
since 1990 is then calculated as the difference in the soil organic carbon stock between the two 
scenarios. 
Finland 
Finland uses Yasso07 soil carbon model as a Tier 3 method to report carbon stock changes on forest 
and agricultural lands as well as in the cases of land use change (Statistics Finland 2017). Yasso07 
is based on a few explicit assumptions on soil carbon cycling and these assumptions form a 
conceptual model further formulated into mathematical equations (Tuomi et al. 2011b; US EPA 
2017). The model has four state variables based on the solubility of the organic material (acid-, 
water-, ethanol- and non-soluble and in addition, there is a humus pool that has the lowest decay 
rate.  
The model is used in the NGHGI to generate annual C stock change rates per hectare based on 
regional estimates of organic matter input (forest and crop statistics) and annual climate parameters. 
Litter input is given in the four solubility fractions based on laboratory measurements. Organic 
matter decays in the five model fractions driven by temperature and precipitation. The resulting C 
stock change rates are applied on the respective land areas to produce regional estimates of C stock 
change. The model is used consistently across different land use categories so that e.g. the initial C 
allocation to different model compartments in forest land converted to cropland is based on the 
results of the simulation of forest soil remaining forest soil. 
Model parameters rely on a large global database of measurements of litter decay, wood decay and 
soil carbon and all parameter values have been estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo method. 
Alternative details in the model structure have been evaluated using Bayesian criteria (Tuomi et al. 
2011a). The results of Yasso07 model are characterized by statistical probability distributions that 
represent uncertainty about the parameter values. The Yasso07 approach makes it possible and easy 
to add new data to the database and develop the model continuously (model-data-fusion). The model 
has been extensively tested against independent data on forest land (Dalsgaard et al. 2016; Lehtonen 
et al. 2016; Rantakari et al. 2012; Tupek et al. 2016) and also on cropland (Karhu et al. 2012). 
Yasso07 is a standard component of Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (Goll et al. 2017) 
and the model is used for UNFCCC reporting in several countries (e.g. Austria, Benin, Czech 
Republic, Estonia, Ireland, Finland, Latvia, Norway, Romania and Switzerland), see Hernandez et 
al. (2017). The model is widely used because it is simple, transparent, verifiable, freely available 
and easy to apply. For more information, consult http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/yasso.

EXAMPLES OF TIER 3 MINERAL SOIL C STOCK CHANGE METHODS 
Japan 
Japan uses a Tier 3 method to estimate soil organic C stock changes in agriculture land (cropland 
and managed grassland) based on RothC. RothC model is a soil carbon dynamic model validated by 
using long-term field experiments (Coleman & Jenkinson 1996). In order to apply the model to 
Japanese agricultural condition, the model was tested against long-term experimental data sets in 
Japanese agricultural lands. It was found that the original model could apply for non-volcanic upland 
soils without any modification or calibration (Shirato & Taniyama 2003), however, the model 
required modification for Andosols and paddy soils by taking unique mechanisms of soil C dynamics 
in these soils into account. For Andosols, the decomposition rate constant of the HUM (humified 
organic matter) pool of RothC was reduced because the presence of Al-humus complexes enhances 
its stability and resistance to decomposition (Shirato et al. 2004). For paddy soils, the decomposition 
rate constants of all four active C pools was reduced on the basis of differences in organic matter 
decomposition rates between upland and paddy (submerged in the rice growing season) soil 
conditions (Shirato & Yokozawa 2005). Model performance was verified by comparing the model 
output with measured soil C stock data under various climate condition, soil types and land uses. 
The model is applied at the country scale (Yagasaki & Shirato 2014) using weather data (monthly 
average temperature, precipitation, and open-pan evaporation), soil property data (soil clay content, 
depth of surface soil, carbon content at the starting year, and bulk density), land use data and other 
activity data (carbon input from crop residue and organic manure) and calculated at each standard 
mesh (100 x 100m). The weather, soil property and land use data are available as spatially explicit 
data set, while carbon input from crop residue and organic manure are calculated by statistical data 
and survey data available based on public administration boundary basis. The all obtained data are 
allocated to each standard mesh and then run the model.  
In the NGHGI, the model is used to generate average C stock change rates per hectare in each 
prefecture and in each sub-category (rice field, upland crop fields, orchards and managed grassland). 
This is because the land use data used for the model estimation (grid-based data set) and used for 
the official land classification in the NGHGI (statistical data) are not consistent very much and so 
Japan put its priority using a consistent land area data among every estimate relating to agriculture 
land in AFOLU sector. This is one of the key challenges of the model application to the NGHGI and 
the development of a standard spatially explicit land use data set is needed for the further 
improvement of estimations. 
United States of America 
The United States uses a Tier 3 method based on the DayCent Ecosystem Model to estimate soil C 
stock changes in cropland and grassland (Ogle et al. 2010, US EPA 2017).  DayCent is a process-
based model that simulated soil organic matter dynamics using a three-pool structure originally 
developed for the Century Model (Parton et al. 1998; Parton et al. 1987). Model testing and 
parameterisation of DayCent has been conducted across a wide range of cropland and grassland sites 
globally. For the inventory, the model is applied using land use data that are compiled through a 
national survey, National Resources Inventory (NRI) (Nusser et al. 1998; Nusser & Goebel 1997).  
The NRI has a two-stage sample with recorded history, starting in 1979, for approximately 400,000 
survey locations that are cropland or grassland throughout the conterminous United States. Each 
survey location that is identified as cropland also has the specific crop rotation histories that were 
grown by the farmer.  Daily weather and soils data are needed to drive the model, and this 
information is based on national datasets. Remote sensing data is used to inform production 
estimates based on MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index products.  Other data are also incorporated 
into the analysis, such as N fertilization rate data compiled through surveys.

EXAMPLES OF TIER 3 MINERAL SOIL C STOCK CHANGE METHODS 
One of the key challenges in developing a Tier 3 method is to robustly address uncertainties.  
Compilers in the United States have addressed uncertainties in model inputs (e.g., fertilization rates, 
tillage practices and organic amendments), model structure and parameterization, and propagate 
uncertainty through the model application using an Approach 2 method (i.e., Monte Carlo Analysis) 
(Ogle et al. 2010).  Model structure and parameterization is addressed using an empirically-based 
method in which observed experimental data are compared to simulation results, and predictive 
ability of the model is quantified using statistical methods (Ogle et al. 2007).  These experimental 
observations are independent from the data that are used to parameterise the model. The resulting 
statistical equation is applied to adjust for biases in model results, if needed, and address the 
precision of the model C stock changes. The major advantage of the Tier 3 method is that the results 
are much more precise than Tier 1 and 2 methods, with uncertainty ranging from ±60% in the Tier 
1 method to about ±20% for the Tier 3 method (US-EPA 2017).  The improved precision is due to 
the process-based framework in the DayCent model that incorporates more drivers of soil C stock 
changes than lower Tier methods.  However, without adequate activity data or a model with 
sufficient prediction capability, a Tier 3 method could produce less precise results than lower-tier 
methods. 
 
BOX 2.2E (NEW) 
CONSIDERATION OF EQUIVALENT MASS METHODS WITHIN TIER 3 MODELLING APPROACHES 
Process models that are used to estimate carbon stock changes over time, such as Century (Parton et 
al. 1987) and RothC (Coleman & Jenkinson 1996) can also be affected by changing soil bulk density 
by the nature of the carbon stock data used for model parameterisation.  These types of models 
simulate the mass balance of organic carbon over time to a defined soil depth (e.g., 30 cm or an 
alternative).  The models require initialisation at which point an initial carbon stock is determined 
along with an initial soil mass in some cases (although the soil mass is rarely determined explicitly, 
it is implicit in the model application).  The models therefore use an equivalent soil mass approach 
to simulate changes in carbon stocks since the estimated carbon stocks are unaffected by concurrent 
soil bulk density changes. If the models are parameterised to carbon stocks on an equivalent mass 
basis, then the carbon stock changes estimated by the parametrised model, and for a factor derived 
from those modelled estimates, will be for soil carbon change on an equivalent mass basis. However, 
the carbon stock change calculated from carbon stock measurements for a fixed depth is the net 
effect of the effect of soil bulk density changes on carbon stocks and the effect of biochemical 
processes on carbon stocks. Therefore, when parameterised using fixed-depth carbon stock data, the 
model will be estimating the net effect of these processes, so the modelled carbon stock estimates 
only will be appropriate for the fixed depth and cannot address changes in mass of the soil over time. 
Careful consideration of the effects of model assumptions and choice of data used for model 
parametrisation and testing is required to understand and properly report the basis of the carbon 
stock changes that are estimated directly or indirectly by a model based on parameterisation with 
data from fixed depths. 
Tier 3 methods can be used to model the loss of biochar C over time after its application to mineral soils and to 
account for GHG sources and sinks not captured in Tier 2, to address changes to N2O or CH4 fluxes from soils8, 
to estimate changes to net primary production (and associated C inputs to soil organic C pool), the mechanisms 
and effects underlying interactions with soil, climate and other environmental variables. Although positive priming 
of labile soil organic matter is not expected to have a significant impact in the long term (Annex 2A.2), negative 
priming leading to an increase in soil organic carbon stocks could have a substantial impact in soils amended with 
biochar (Woolf et al. 2012). Similarly, to the extent that there are reductions in net emissions of N2O and CH4 
from soil and increases in plant growth, there could be a larger impact of biochar additions on reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions (Gaunt & Lehmann 2008; Woolf et al. 2010; Hammond et al. 2011). It is also important to recognise 
                                                           
8 Impacts of biochar amendments on N2O are estimated in the methods for soil N2O emissions (Chapter 11), and impacts on 
CH4 emissions are estimated from specific land uses in the inventory, such as Rice Cultivation (Chapter 5) and Wetlands 
(Chapter 7).  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.48 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
that the dynamic nature of biochar decomposition is important because its net impact on soil C stocks and GHG 
emissions varies with time, which can be better addressed with a Tier 3 model. 
Examples of advanced modelling approaches include representing the dynamic impact of biochar decomposition 
over long time scales (Lenton & Vaughan 2009), and process-based modelling using biochar-specific LCA models 
(e.g. Roberts et al. 2010; Hammond et al. 2011; Shackley et al. 2012; Sparrevik et al. 2013).  There are also 
applications that have focused on soil greenhouse gas emission balances, together with modelling of 
decomposition rates (H/Corg ratio; Lehmann et al. 2015) and priming (Woolf & Lehmann, 2012; Wang et al. 2016). 
In addition, models have been used to simulate nitrous oxide reductions (Cayuela et al. 2013, 2014) as a function 
of H/Corg ratio (Cayuela et al. 2015) and feedbacks to primary plant productivity (Jeffery et al. 2011, 2015) and 
associated impacts on SOC stocks (Whitman et al. 2010, 2011).

NON-CO2 EMISSIONS 
There are significant emissions of non-greenhouse gases from biomass burning, livestock and manure management, 
or soils. N2O emissions from soils are covered in Chapter 11, where guidance is given on methods that can be 
applied nationally (i.e., irrespective of land-use types) if a country chooses to use national scale activity data. The 
guidance on CH4 and N2O emissions from livestock and manure are addressed only in Chapter 10 because 
emissions do not depend on land characteristics. A generic approach to estimating greenhouse gas emissions from 
fire (both CO2 and non-CO2 gases) is described below, with land-use specific enhancements given in the Forest 
Land, Grassland and Cropland chapters. It is good practice to check for complete coverage of CO2 and non-CO2 
emissions due to losses in carbon stocks and pools to avoid omissions or double counting. 
Emissions from fire include not only CO2, but also other greenhouse gases, or precursors of greenhouse gases, that 
originate from incomplete combustion of the fuel. These include carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), non-
methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and nitrogen (e.g., N2O, NOx) species (Levine, 1994). In the 1996 
IPCC Guidelines and GPG2000, non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from fire in savannas and burning of crop 
residues were addressed along with emissions from Forest Land and Grassland conversion. The methodology 
differed somewhat by vegetation type, and fires in Forest Land were not included. In the GPG-LULUCF, emissions 
(CO2 and non-CO2) from fires were addressed, particularly in the chapter covering Forest Land (losses of carbon 
resulting from disturbances). In the Cropland and Grassland chapters, only non-CO2 emissions were considered, 
with the assumption that the CO2 emissions would be counterbalanced by CO2 removals from the subsequent re-
growth of the vegetation within one year. This assumption implies maintenance of soil fertility – an assumption 
which countries may ignore if they have evidence of fertility decline due to fire. In Forest Land, there is generally 
a lack of synchrony (non-equivalence of CO2 emissions and removals in the year of reporting).   
These Guidelines provide a more generic approach for estimating emissions from fire. Fire is treated as a 
disturbance that affects not only the biomass (in particular, above-ground), but also the dead organic matter (litter 
and dead wood). The term `biomass burning` is widely used and is retained in these Guidelines but acknowledging 
that fuel components other than live biomass are often very significant, especially in forest systems. For Cropland 
and Grassland having little woody vegetation, reference is usually made to biomass burning, since biomass is the 
main pool affected by the fire. 
Countries should apply the following principles when estimating greenhouse gas emissions resulting from fires in 
Forest Land, Cropland and Grassland: 
 
Coverage of reporting: Emissions (CO2 and non- CO2) need to be reported for all fires (prescribed fires and 
wildfires) on managed lands (the exception is CO2 from Grassland, as discussed below). Where there is a land-
use change, any greenhouse gas emission from fire should be reported under the new land-use category 
(transitional category). Emissions from wildfires (and escaped prescribed fires) that occur on unmanaged lands 
do not need to be reported, unless those lands are followed by a land-use change (i.e., become managed land). 
 
Fire as a management tool (prescribed burning): greenhouse gas emissions from the area burnt are reported, 
and if the fire affects unmanaged land, greenhouse gas emissions should also be reported if the fire is followed 
by a land-use change. 
 
Equivalence (synchrony) of CO2 emissions and removals: CO2 net emissions should be reported where the 
CO2 emissions and removals for the biomass pool are not equivalent in the inventory year. For grassland 
 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.49 
biomass burning and burning of agriculture residues, the assumption of equivalence is generally reasonable. 
However, woody vegetation may also burn in these land categories, and greenhouse gas emissions from those 
sources should be reported using a higher Tier method. Further, in many parts of the world, grazing is the 
predominant land use in Forest Land that are regularly burnt (e.g., grazed woodlands and savannas), and care 
must be taken before assuming synchrony in such systems. For Forest Land, synchrony is unlikely if 
significant woody biomass is killed (i.e., losses represent several years of growth and C accumulation), and 
the net emissions should be reported. Examples include: clearing of native forest and conversion to agriculture 
and/or plantations and wildfires in Forest Land.  
 
Fuels available for combustion: Factors that reduce the amount of fuels available for combustion (e.g., from 
grazing, decay, removal of biofuels, livestock feed, etc.) should be accounted for. A mass balance approach 
should be adopted to account for residues, to avoid underestimation or double counting (refer to Section 2.3.2).  
 
Annual reporting: despite the large inherent spatial and temporal variability of fire (in particular that from 
wildfires), countries should estimate and report greenhouse gas emissions from fire on an annual basis.      
These Guidelines provide a comprehensive approach for estimating carbon stock changes and non-CO2 emissions 
resulting from fire in the Forest Land (including those resulting from forest conversion), and non-CO2 emissions 
in the Cropland and Grassland. Non-CO2 emissions are addressed for the following five types of burning: (1) 
grassland burning (which includes perennial woody shrubland and savanna burning); (2) agricultural residues 
burning; (3) burning of litter, understory and harvest residues in Forest Land, (4) burning following forest clearing 
and conversion to agriculture; and (5) other types of burning (including those resulting from wildfires). Direct 
emissions of CO2 are also addressed for items (3) and (4) and (5). Since estimating emissions in these different 
categories have many elements in common, this section provides a generic approach to estimate CO2 and non-CO2 
emissions from fire, to avoid repetition in specific land-use sections that address emissions from fire in these 
Guidelines.  
Prescribed burning of savannas is included under the grassland biomass burning section (Chapter 6, Grassland, 
Section 6.3.4). It is important to avoid double counting when estimating greenhouse gas emissions from savannas 
that have a vegetation physiognomy characteristic of Forest Land. An example of this is the cerradão (dense 
woodland) formation in Brazil which, although being a type of savanna, is included under Forest Land, due to its 
biophysical characteristics.   
In addition to the greenhouse gas emissions from combustion, fires may lead to the creation of an inert carbon 
stock (charcoal or char). Post-fire residues comprise unburned and partially burnt components, as well as a small 
amount of char that due to its chemical nature is highly resistant to decomposition. The knowledge of the rates of 
char formation under contrasting burning conditions and subsequent turnover rates is currently too limited (Forbes 
et al., 2006; Preston and Schmidt, 2006) to allow development of a reliable methodology for inventory purposes, 
and hence is not included in these Guidelines. A technical basis for further methodological development is included 
in Appendix 1. 
Additionally, although emissions of NMVOC also occur as a result of fire, they are not addressed in the present 
Guidelines due to the paucity of the data and size of uncertainties in many of the key parameters needed for the 
estimation, which prevent the development of reliable emission estimates.  
METHOD DESCRIPTION 
Each relevant section in these Guidelines includes a three-tiered approach to address CO2 (where applicable) and 
non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from fire. The choice of Tier can be made following the steps in the decision 
tree presented in Figure 2.6. Under the Tier 1 approach, the formulation presented in Equation 2.27 can be applied 
to estimate CO2 and non-CO2 emissions from fire, using the default data provided in this chapter and in the relevant 
land-use sections of these Guidelines. Higher Tiers involve a more refined application of Equation 2.27. 
Since Tier 1 methodology adopts a simplified approach to estimating the dead organic matter pool (see Section 
2.3.2), certain assumptions must be made when estimating net greenhouse gas emissions from fire in those systems 
(e.g. Forest Land, and Forest Land converted to another land use), where dead organic matter can be a major 
component of the fuel burnt. Emissions of CO2 from dead organic matter are assumed to be zero in forests that are 
burnt, but not killed by fire. If the fire is of sufficient intensity to kill a portion of the forest stand, under Tier 1 
methodology, the C contained in the killed biomass is assumed to be immediately released to the atmosphere. This 
Tier 1 simplification may result in an overestimation of actual emissions in the year of the fire, if the amount of 
biomass carbon killed by the fire is greater than the amount of dead wood and litter carbon consumed by the fire.  
Non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions are estimated for all fire situations. Under Tier 1, non-CO2 emissions are best 
estimated using the actual fuel consumption provided in Table 2.7, and appropriate emission factors (Table 2.8) 
(i.e., not including newly killed biomass as a component of the fuel consumed). Clearly, if fire in forests contributes 
significantly to net greenhouse gas emissions, countries are encouraged to develop a more complete methodology 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.50 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
(higher tiers) which includes the dynamics of dead organic matter and improves the estimates of direct and post-
fire emissions. 
For Forest Land converted to other land uses, organic matter burnt is derived from both newly felled vegetation 
and existing dead organic matter, and CO2 emissions should be reported.  In this situation, estimates of total fuel 
consumed (Table 2.6) can be used to estimate emissions of CO2 and non- greenhouse gases using Equation 2.27. 
Care must be taken, however, to ensure that dead organic matter carbon losses during the land-use conversion are 
not double counted in Equations 2.27 (as losses from burning) and Equation 2.23 (as losses from decay). 
A generic methodology to estimate the emissions of individual greenhouse gases for any type of fire is summarised 
in Equation 2.27.

Note. Where data for MB and Cf are not available, a default value for the amount of fuel actually burnt (the product

For CO2 emissions, Equation 2.27 relates to Equation 2.14, which estimates the annual amount of live biomass 
loss from any type of disturbance.  
The amount of fuel that can be burnt is given by the area burnt and the density of fuel present on that area. The 
fuel density can include biomass, dead wood and litter, which vary as a function of the type, age and condition of 
the vegetation. The type of fire also affects the amount of fuel available for combustion. For example, fuel available 
for low-intensity ground fires in forests will be largely restricted to litter and dead organic matter on the surface, 
while a higher-intensity ‘crown fire’ can also consume substantial amounts of tree biomass.   
The combustion factor is a measure of the proportion of the fuel that is actually combusted, which varies as a 
function of the size and architecture of the fuel load (i.e., a smaller proportion of large, coarse fuel such as tree 
stems will be burnt compared to fine fuels, such as grass leaves), the moisture content of the fuel and the type of 
fire (i.e., intensity and rate of spread which is markedly affected by climatic variability and regional differences as 
reflected in Table 2.4). Finally, the emission factor gives the amount of a particular greenhouse gas emitted per 
unit of dry matter combusted, which can vary as a function of the carbon content of the biomass and the 
completeness of combustion. For species with high N concentrations, NOx and N2O emissions from fire can vary 
as a function of the N content of the fuel. A comprehensive review of emission factors was conducted by Andreae 
and Merlet (2001) and is summarised in Table 2.5. 
Tier 2 methods employ the same general approach as Tier 1 but make use of more refined country-derived emission 
factors and/or more refined estimates of fuel densities and combustion factors than those provided in the default 
tables. Tier 3 methods are more comprehensive and include considerations of the dynamics of fuels (biomass and 
dead organic matter).

ADDITIONAL GENERIC GUIDANCE FOR TIER 
3 METHODS 
Tier 3 inventories are advanced systems using measurements and/or modelling, with the goal of improving the 
estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals, beyond what is possible with Tier 1 or 2 methods.   
In this section, guidelines are elaborated that provide a sound scientific basis for the development of Tier 3 
Inventories in the AFOLU sector. These guidelines do not limit the selection of Tier 3 sampling schemes or 
modelling methods but provide general guidance to assist the inventory developer in their implementation. 
AFOLU inventory compilers are advised to read this section in conjunction with general guidance for Tier 3 
methods relevant to all sectors found in Volume 1, Chapter 6. 
2.5.1 
Measurement-based Tier 3 inventories 
Inventories can be based on direct measurements from which emissions and removals of carbon are estimated. 
Purely measurement-based inventories, e.g., based on repeated measurements using a national forest inventory or 
similar estimation methods can produce carbon stock change estimates but still rely on appropriate statistical 
models, such as allometric models or volume and wood density functions. Inventories using measurement-based 
methods also need to select appropriate statistical sampling estimators to produce a national inventory from the 
plot estimates. Moreover, inventory plot remeasurements will typically require additional data or methods to arrive 
at estimates of GHG emissions from disturbance events, in particular for non-CO2 GHG. Measurement of non-
CO2 greenhouse gas emissions is possible, but because of the high spatial and temporal variability, Tier 3 methods 
for estimating non-CO2 emissions typically use a combination of models (see Section 2.5.2) and measurements. 
Many countries using a measurement-based Tier 3 method will already have well established national inventories. 
Typically, these inventories have been established for purposes other than collecting data for estimating carbon 
stock changes and non-CO2 emissions (e.g., National Forest Inventories for timber resource assessments or soil 
resource mapping for agricultural planning). In general, the following six steps should be considered when 
implementing a measurement-based Tier 3 inventory.  
Step 1.  Develop a sampling scheme, including sample unit (plot) design and 
measurements to be collected.  
Sampling schemes can be developed using a variety of methods such as simple random, stratified random, 
systematic or model-based sampling. When designing a sampling scheme, countries often also consider factors 
such as spatial variability and temporal dynamics of carbon stocks, key environmental variables (e.g., climate) and 
management systems (e.g., harvested forest land, grazed grassland).  
When using a repeated measurement design, the timing of re-measurement may be influenced by the rate of change 
experienced. For example, re-measurement periods in boreal and some temperate regions, where trees grow slowly 
and DOM pools change little in single years, can be longer than in environments where carbon dynamics are more 
rapid. When implementing a measurement-based Tier 3 inventory, the inventory compiler should take into 
consideration that it will not be possible to estimate emissions and removals using the stock-difference method 
until a minimum of two measurement cycles have been conducted (often 10 years or longer in total).  
Some sampling schemes do not include re-sampling of the same sites (e.g., temporary inventory plot designs). 
Such designs may limit the statistical power of the analysis when estimating change, and therefore lead to greater 
uncertainty in estimates of carbon stock change. Repeated measurement designs with permanent plot locations 
typically provide a better basis for estimating carbon stock changes or emissions. The utility of permanent plots is 
often greater if they are accurately georeferenced to facilitate the use of spatial auxiliary variables, such as from 
remote sensing (GFOI, 2016). 
For some carbon pools, such as soil carbon, litter and woody debris, it is not necessarily possible to remeasure the 
same material through time (i.e., if taking a soil core, that soil has been removed from the site and cannot be 
remeasured, unlike measuring the same trees through time). However, multiple samples can be taken at each time 
step to capture local site scale heterogeneity in the carbon stock and detect changes over time with each re-sampling 
of a site (Ellert et al., 2002, Conant et al., 2003). Where countries use direct measurement methods for soil C, the 
sampling design needs to ensure that a sufficient number of samples are taken at each measurement time for 
estimating stock change (Spencer et al., 2011).  
Inventory and plot designs should consider the practicality of implementation given country circumstances (e.g., 
terrain, access, safety, vegetation type). The types and number of measurements will depend on the plot design, 
the underlying population of carbon pools to be reported and the data requirements of methods adopted to estimate 
carbon stocks and stock changes from the plot data.  
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.58 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
It is good practice to develop a methodology handbook (e.g., Canadian Forest Service, 2008; US Forest Service, 
2006) explaining the entire sampling scheme as part of Step 1. This handbook can be useful for those involved 
with the measurements, laboratory analyses and other aspects of the process, as well as possibly providing 
supporting material for documentation purposes. The handbook should document the plot design, in particular 
how plots are to be located and, in the case of repeated measurement designs, re-located for future measurements 
(Vidal et al., 2016). 
Step 2. Select sample sites.  
Specific sampling sites will be located based on sampling design. It is good practice to have an appropriate process 
in place for selecting alternative sites in case it is not possible to sample some original locations.  In a repeated 
measurement design, the sites will become a monitoring network that is periodically re-sampled. 
Determining sampling locations will likely involve the use of a geographic information system. A geographic 
database may include information on land use and land-use changes (i.e., activity data) as well as a variety of 
environmental and management data, such as climate, soils, land use, and livestock operations, depending on the 
source category and stratification. If key geographic data are not available at the national scale, or are spatially 
inconsistent, the inventory developer may either 1) re-evaluate the design and stratification (if used) in Step 1 and 
possibly modify the sampling design or 2) re-develop the geographic data to meet the inventory requirements. 
Normally the sampling intensity should be the same within a stratum but not necessarily between strata. However, 
where the stratification is based on land use and is updated for each inventory, changes in land use between 
measurement periods can complicate the estimation of changes in carbon stocks over time. As such, it is good 
practice to use stratification methods that do not lead to bias or time-series inconsistencies due to changes in land 
use. 
Sampling may require coordination among different national ministries, provincial or state governments, corporate 
and private land owners. Establishing relationships among these stakeholders can be undertaken before collecting 
initial samples. Informing stakeholders about ongoing monitoring may also be helpful and lead to greater success 
in implementing monitoring programs. 
Step 3. Collect initial samples.  
Once the plot locations have been determined, a measurement team can visit those locations, establish plots and 
collect initial measurements and samples. It is helpful to take geographic coordinates of plot locations or sample 
points with a global positioning system (GPS) to help relocate them later, noting that GPS readings are often not 
accurate enough to relocate the exact plot location, especially under dense forest canopies.  As such, if repeated 
measurements are planned, it is good practice to permanently mark the location for ease of finding and re-sampling 
the site in the future.  Where possible these markers should not be visible to the land owner (e.g., utility ball 
markers that can be buried in the soil and re-located precisely over time).  
It is good practice to take relevant measurements and notes of the environmental conditions and management at 
the site. This will confirm that the conditions were consistent with the design of the sampling scheme, and also 
may be used in data analysis (Step 5). If a stratified sampling approach is used, and it becomes apparent that many 
or most sites are not consistent with the expected environmental conditions and management systems, it is good 
practice to repeat Step 1, re-evaluating and possibly modifying the sampling scheme based on the new information. 
Step 4. Re-sample the monitoring network on a periodic basis.  
For repeated measurement designs, sampling sites will be periodically re-sampled with the time between re-
measurement dependant on the rate of stock changes or the variability in emissions, the resources available for the 
monitoring program, and the design of the sampling scheme. It is good practice to avoid any impact of 
measurement techniques on C stocks and their dynamics (i.e. no destructive sampling) where permanent sample 
plots are used. 
If destructive sampling is involved, such as removing a soil core or dead organic matter sample, it is good practice 
to re-sample at the same site but not at the exact location in which the sample was removed during the past. 
Destructive sampling the exact location is likely to create bias in the measurements. Such biases would 
compromise the monitoring and produce results that are not representative of national trends. When destructive 
sampling of trees is undertaken, for example to develop or validate allometric equations, the samples are usually 
taken from locations or species that are considered representative of the trees in the plots.  
Step 5. Analyse data and determine carbon stock changes/non-CO 2 emissions, and 
infer national emissions and removal estimates and their uncertainty. 
A well-designed sampling scheme will provide an unbiased estimate and variance for the measured quantities (See 
Volume I, Chapter 3 for more information).  The overall result of the statistical analysis will be estimates of carbon 
stock changes or measurements of emissions from which the national emission and removal estimates can be 
derived.  
 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.59 
To derive estimates of carbon stock changes or emissions from measurements collected on the plots typically 
requires the use of models that relate these measurements to carbon stocks. The types of models and the uncertainty 
associated with them vary depending on measurements taken and the carbon pools being estimated.  Examples of 
these models include allometric equations for estimating tree and deadwood biomass, root:shoot ratios for 
estimating belowground biomass (Mokany et al., 2006) and the use of spectral signatures to estimate soil carbon 
(Baldock et al., 2013).  
When estimating uncertainty for carbon stock changes and/or emissions it is good practice to include all relevant 
sources of uncertainty, including the sampling scheme, plot measurements and model parameters and structure 
and laboratory processing methods (see discussion for each source category later in this volume in addition to the 
uncertainty chapter in Volume 1). Overall uncertainty can be reduced by increasing the sampling intensity, using 
additional strata or covariates to explain more of the variance or improving the models. Model uncertainty may 
be relatively small, at least in situations with well-developed models calibrated for national situations, or relatively 
large where global models are applied. 
To obtain national estimates of carbon stock changes or emission of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, it may be 
necessary to interpolate or extrapolate measurements using spatial statistical analyses and models that take into 
consideration environmental conditions, management and other activity data. Such models are necessary because 
of the expense and difficulty in obtaining a sufficient sampling intensity to infer C stock changes or emissions 
directly from the survey sample. For example, CH4 and N2O emissions from forest fires are typically inferred from 
data on the area burnt, and fuel consumption estimates derived from specific case studies. In a similar fashion, soil 
N2O emissions could be readily estimated using chambers, but this can be very expensive to establish a network 
with the sampling intensity needed to provide national emission estimates based solely on measurements without 
use of models for extrapolation. Alternatively, compilers may use a model-based approach in these cases, which 
is informed by the limited sample of C stock or emission measurements (See Section 2.1.2). 
It is good practice to analyse emissions relative to environmental conditions in addition to the contribution of 
various management practices to those trends. Interpretation of the patterns will be useful in evaluating possibilities 
for future mitigation. 
Step 6. Reporting and Documentation. 
It is good practice to assemble inventory results in a systematic and transparent manner for reporting purposes.   
Documentation typically includes a description of the sampling scheme and statistical methods, sampling schedule 
(including re-sampling), stock change and emissions estimates and the interpretation of emission trends (e.g., 
contributions of management activities). In addition, QA/QC should be completed and documented in the report. 
For details on QA/QC, reporting and documentation, see the section dealing with the specific source category later 
in this volume, as well as information provided in Volume 1, Chapter 6. 
When developing/collating documentation for reporting Tier 3 measurement-based methods it is good practice to: 
 
describe the sampling design and/or measurements; 
 
describe any changes in the design or measurements through time and how these changes are addressed to 
ensure time series consistency in carbon stocks or emissions; 
 
describe the models used to calculate carbon stock changes and non-CO2 emissions from the measurements, 
including the uncertainty;  
 
describe how area estimates are derived from the survey, such as a national forest inventory, and harmonized 
with land representation data for other land-uses; 
 
discuss the influence of time periods between measurement cycles on estimated C stock changes or emission 
estimates, and how this impact is incorporated into the uncertainty analysis; and  
 
document, if applicable, how Tier 3 measurement methods are applied consistently with Tier 2 or Tier 3 
model-based methods to prevent errors of omission or commission in reported carbon stock changes or 
emissions for the entire spatial and temporal domain of the country.

Model-based Tier 3 inventories 
Model-based Tier 3 inventories are developed using empirical (e.g. forest growth curves that represent carbon 
stock increase with tree age.), process-based (e.g. model representation of underlying physiological, biophysical, 
and management processes that drive carbon dynamics in ecosystems), hybrid (e.g. the development of forest 
growth curves from empirical data combined with a process model calibrated from research data on dead organic 
matter dynamics) and/or other types of models. Just as Tier 3 measurement-based methods typically also require 
models to estimate carbon stock changes (see Section 2.1.1), Tier 3 model-based inventories require measurements 
to calibrate and validate the models used to estimate carbon stock changes. 
It is unlikely that one single model will be suitable for estimating emissions and removals for all carbon pools and 
non-CO2 gases across all land uses, land-use changes and management actions. Therefore, inventory compilers 
will need to select a suite of different models to develop estimates of interest. In many cases existing models need 
to be adapted, coupled and/or integrated to provide a complete estimate of emissions and removals in the source 
categories of interest.  
When selecting a model, it is important to consider how it will be used and interact with other models. This is 
particularly important when using Tier 3 mass-balance models in combination with Tier 1 or 2 emissions factors 
(e.g. if different soil carbon models or methods are used for different land-uses, how will the carbon pools be 
transferred between them in the case of land-use change). If changes in modelling methods within the reporting 
time series occur adequate steps should be taken to ensure time series consistency.  
Models may be run individually for different land uses and carbon pools and the results combined or brought 
together in a single framework using coupling and integration techniques. Individual model simulations are 
typically used where multiple agencies are responsible for developing different parts of the inventory (e.g., the 
forest agency responsible for forest lands, the agriculture agency responsible for cropland and grassland). 
Coupling different models is a convenient strategy for addressing effects with different time and space scales. In 
contrast, model integration links different modelling approaches to elucidate the complex dimension of time and 
space dynamics (Panichelli & Gnansounou, 2015), helping ensure consistency in land representation, carbon pools 
and input variables (Brack et al., 2006). Integration frameworks can also help organize data and estimation methods 
at any level of methodological complexity and facilitate the systematic progression from simpler to more complex 
methods (GFOI, 2016).  
In all cases, models used in Tier 3 methods ensure higher accuracy only when they are correctly implemented and 
capable of representing the population of interest. In general, the following seven steps are used to correctly 
implement a Tier 3 model-based inventory (see also Figure 1, Volume 1, Chapter 6, Section 2.4).  
Step 1. Model selection or development 
Inventory compilers can choose from a wide range of model types depending on reporting needs, data availability 
and capacity. As part of model selection or development, it is good practice to consider if the model/s:  
 
adequately represent the range of land uses, ecosystems and management practices in the region or country; 
 
Chapter 2: Generic Methodologies Applicable to Multiple Land-Use Categories 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
2.61 
 
allow for the quantification of uncertainty; 
 
reduce uncertainty relative to other available methods (e.g., Tier 1 methods) or estimates are improved in other 
ways (e.g., more complete coverage of carbon pools or lands); 
 
can be run and maintained in an operational context with available time and resources (e.g., input data is 
readily available, staff have sufficient experience and knowledge, suitable compute infrastructure is available); 
 
produce outputs that can be used for reporting emissions and removals by relevant land-use categories; 
 
produce time-series consistent results; 
 
are compatible with other existing models used in the inventory; and 
 
are well documented and tested. 
Multiple models will likely be selected as potentially suitable as part of Step 1. These models can then be tested 
prior to implementation using steps 2 and 3 below. Therefore, before moving to Step 2, at least a sub-set of the 
input data required to run the model should be collected or collated, including input variables (such as forest 
species or type, climate, soil characteristics), and any existing parameters and data required for further model 
calibration and evaluation. In some cases, input data may be a limiting factor in model selection or development, 
requiring some models to be discarded or modified to accommodate the available activity and/or environmental 
data.  
Step 2. Model Calibration  
Model calibration (i.e. parameterisation) is the process of selecting or adjusting model parameters to obtain results 
that best represent the processes of interest in the region (and time period) for which the model will be applied. 
The model calibration procedure readies a model for its further use in analyses. For example, replacing default 
growth curves with those specific to the tree species or site conditions to which the model will be applied or 
replacing climate averages with regional climate data are examples of model parameterisation.  
Calibration data should represent the population.  In practice, this does not mean that all environmental conditions 
are covered, but that the calibration data includes a range of the conditions existing the country that is 
representative of national circumstances. 
Model sensitivity analyses may be used to determine the most important parameters for calibration.  In a sensitivity 
analysis, parameter values are varied through a series of simulations to determine the associated change in model 
output. The parameters are ranked from most to least sensitive based on the level of change in model output.  Some 
techniques also incorporate measurements into the sensitivity analysis (Sobol, 2001). The most sensitive 
parameters are typically calibrated to improve the agreement between modelled and measured carbon stocks, stock 
changes or non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions.  
There are multiple methods for calibrating models. Simpler empirical models (e.g., empirical forest growth models 
based on forest age or site indices) are commonly developed by fitting functions to data on carbon stocks or stock 
changes using standard statistical methods and software. More advanced models (e.g., hybrid or process-based 
models) typically have numerous, interrelated parameters. For these models calibration is often completed using 
parameter optimisation methods that vary the model parameters within known ranges to best match known results 
(e.g., carbon stocks). There are several methods for doing this, including generic algorithms, machine learning and 
Bayesian. The methods may also be used to propagate error through the inventory analysis (e.g., Hararuk et al., 
2017).   
In all cases it is good practice to document the calibration procedure and results.   
Re-calibration of the model or modifications to the structure may be necessary if the model does not capture 
general trends or there are large systematic biases. Full evaluation of the model is described in Step 3.  See Box 
2.2f for examples of model calibration.

AN EXAMPLE OF MODEL CALIBRATION, EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENT THROUGH DATA ASSIMILATION 
The development of Canada’s Carbon Budget Model for the Canadian Forest Sector started in 1989 
and is continually being improved through new data collection, analysis and model enhancements. 
As part of this process, Shaw et al., (2014) assessed CBM-CFS3’s ability to predict ecosystem 
carbon stocks in independent plots established as part of Canada’s national forest inventory (NFI). 
The study demonstrated close agreement in the predictions of total ecosystem carbon stocks (within 
1percent) but found some compensating errors (bias) in specific pools, ecozones, and plots with 
different tree species. 
To further improve the CBM-CFS3 performance in Canadian forest ecosystems, a Bayesian Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique was used to calibrate 45 model parameters by assimilating 
carbon stocks of six deadwood and soil carbon pools estimated from 635 plots from Canada’s 
National Forest Inventory (Hararuk et al., 2017). These plots were randomly split into two groups; 
calibration (n = 326), used to calibrate the parameters, and validation (n = 309), used to evaluate the 
performance of the model with calibrated parameters. 
Calibration led to most improvement in the simulation of carbon stocks in small and fine woody 
debris, reducing RMSE by 54.3 percent, followed by the snag stems (RMSE reduced by 23.2 
percent), and coarse woody debris (13 percent). Twenty of the 45 parameters were well constrained 
by the available data. The calibrated parameters resulted in increased rates of carbon cycling in fine 
and coarse woody debris and the soil organic layer, distinct carbon dynamics in hardwood and 
softwood dominated stands, and increased temperature sensitivity of the carbon contained in the 
mineral soil.  
While parameter calibration considerably improved the simulation of the small and fine woody 
debris and snags stem pools, model representation of the branch snag, coarse woody debris, soil 
organic layer, and mineral soil pools were not substantially improved. This indicated the need for 
the inclusion of additional processes in carbon dynamics simulation or a change in the modelling 
paradigm. Model improvements may be achieved by including a lignin effect on deadwood decay 
and by including the effects of tree species, soil types, and mosses (see Box 2.2g) in the CBM-CFS3. 
Further data assimilation analyses are ongoing. 
Step 3. Evaluation of Model Behaviour    
Once the model has been calibrated, it should be evaluated to demonstrate that the model effectively simulates 
measured trends for the source category of interest.  Evaluation can also support the justification for selecting, 
developing or possibly improving a particular model for the inventory analysis.   
It is good practice to use measurements independent of those used for model calibration when evaluating model 
behaviour and to confirm that the model is capable of estimating emissions and removals in the source categories 
of interest (Falloon and Smith, 2002; Prisley and Mortimer, 2004). In practice, this is typically achieved by setting 
aside a subset of data collected for model calibration to be used exclusively for model evaluation. Comparisons 
between model output and independent measurements can be made using statistical tests and/or graphically.  In 
addition to evaluation with independent data, other evaluation checks may be useful, including: 
 
range checks to show that estimates of carbon stocks and changes in all pools do not exceed pre-defined 
expected limits; 
 
in models that track both stocks and flows between carbon pools and the atmosphere, that mass-balance is 
been maintained through all simulations; 
 
use of other statistical methods for assessing model behaviour, such as resampling methods (e.g., 
bootstrapping); and 
 
assessment of the sensitivity of various parameters in the model (sensitivity analysis). 
It is good practice to ensure that the model responds appropriately to variations in activity data and environmental 
conditions occurring in the spatial and temporal domain where the model will be applied. Re-calibration of the 
model or modifications to the structure (i.e., algorithms) may be necessary if the model does not capture general 
trends or there are large systematic biases. In some cases, a new model may be selected or developed based on this 
evaluation. Evaluation results are an important component of the reporting documentation. See Box 2.2g for 
examples of model evaluation and improvement.

EXAMPLE OF MODEL EVALUATION AND IMPROVEMENT 
Finland 
The sample sizes in soil carbon inventories are usually not adequate for national level soil carbon 
stock change assessment with few exceptions (e.g., Sweden, and Germany, see Gamfeldt et al., 2014 
and Grüneberg et al., 2014). As such, most countries use soil carbon models to estimate carbon stock 
changes then evaluate the results using repeated soil inventories. In general, it has been shown that 
models can estimate soil carbon stock change in the same magnitude as that measured, but 
uncertainties of both measurements and model estimates are often higher than actual measurements 
(Ortiz et al., 2009; Rantakari et al., 2012). This makes the evaluation of model outputs challenging.  
Two soils carbon models are commonly used in Finland: Yasso07 and ROMULv. An evaluation of 
the performance of these models against forest soil carbon stock measurements was undertaken by 
Lehtonen et al. (2016). Both models require estimates of carbon input from vegetation. Litter input 
from trees was estimated using litter production rates from research sites and stem volume maps 
from the National Forest Inventory. Inputs from understorey vegetation were estimated using new 
biomass models.  
To evaluate the models, both were applied across Finland and run until steady state was achieved; 
thereafter, measured soil carbon stocks were compared with model estimates. The evaluation showed 
that the role of understorey litter input was underestimated by Yasso07, especially in northern 
Finland, and the inclusion of soil water holding capacity in the ROMULv model improved 
predictions, especially in southern Finland. Simulations and measurements indicated that models 
using only litter quality and quantity and weather data underestimate soil carbon stock in southern 
Finland, and this underestimation is due to omission of the impact of droughts on the decomposition 
of organic layers. The model evaluation results imply improving estimates of understorey litter 
production in the northern latitudes would be an area for improvement in greenhouse gas inventories 
(Lehtonen et al., 2016). 
Canada 
An evaluation of CBM-CFS3 ability to predict ecosystem carbon stock estimates derived from an 
entirely independent data set from the initial establishment of Canada’s new National Forest 
Inventory (Gillis et al., 2005) was undertaken (Stinson et al., 2016). Estimates of aboveground 
biomass, dead organic matter and soil carbon stocks from up to 696 ground plots were compared to 
model-derived estimates (Shaw et al., 2014). Model simulations for each ground plot used only the 
type of input data available to the NFCMARS for the NIR in 2010.None of the model’s default 
parameters were altered. Ecosystem total C stocks estimated by CBM-CFS3 were unbiased (mean 
difference = 1.9 Mg ha−1, p = 0.397), and significantly correlated (r = 0.54, p > 0.001) with ground 
plot-based estimates. Although the overall C stock estimates were within 1 percent of the observed 
values, detailed analyses also revealed compensating biases specific to pools, ecozones or leading 
species.  Contribution to ecosystem total C stocks error from soil was large, and from deadwood and 
aboveground biomass small. Results for percent error in the aboveground biomass (7.5 percent) and 
deadwood (30.8 percent) pools compared favourably to the GPG-LULUCF standards of 8 percent 
and 30 percent, respectively. Further details are provided in Shaw et al. (2014). 
Subsequent analyses assessed the reasons for the consistent under prediction of organic carbon 
stocks in low productivity boreal sites, in which mosses can contribute 30 percent or more of total 
ecosystem Net Primary Production (Bona et al., 2013). Although mosses are not a carbon stock that 
is included in the IPCC pools, it is increasingly evident that omitting them will result in significant 
under prediction of both carbon stocks and fluxes in forest ecosystems with high moss cover. Bona 
et al. (2016) estimated that in poorly drained upland black spruce forests of boreal Canada as much 
as 31–49 percent of the total carbon stocks are potentially contributed by mosses alone. A new moss 
module was developed and added to the CBM-CFS3 and off-line comparisons indicate that 
representing moss carbon stocks and inputs will reduce bias in organic carbon stock estimates (Bona 
et al., 2016). 
Step 4. Collect and collate require model data inputs  
Models require specific input data to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and removals associated with a source 
category. These inputs may range from weather and soils data to livestock numbers, forest types, natural 
disturbances or cropping management practices. While much of this data may have been collected as part of the 
model selection process (Step 1), additional data may need to be collected prior to full implementation. For 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.64 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
example, the climate data used in model selection may have only been for specific points, while for implementation 
the model will require the data spatially over large areas. In these cases, the new spatial input data may need to be 
developed to implement the model at the desired spatio-temporal scale.   
Step 5. Model Implementation  
The major consideration when implementing the model is to obtain enough computing resources and personnel 
time to prepare the input data, conduct the model simulations, and analyse the results. In some cases, limitations 
in computing resources may constrain the complexity and range of spatial or temporal resolution that can be used 
in implementing the model at the national scale (i.e. simulating at finer spatial and temporal scales will require 
greater computing resources). An initial analysis of computing needs should be explored during model selection 
and development (Step 1). It may be possible to increase the efficiency of this process using programming scripts, 
re-coding parts of the model and adjusting the spatial and temporal extent and resolution of the simulations. It may 
also be possible to implement the model on computing resources that are outside the agency (e.g. cloud-based 
computing). 
Step 6. Assess uncertainty 
Uncertainty analysis should not be confused with sensitivity analysis. Uncertainty analysis determines the 
probabilities of a range of estimates that can be used to derive confidence intervals for the estimates, and to develop 
plans to further reduce uncertainties. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the relative change in model 
output given changes in model input values, which can be informative for model calibration (See Step 3). 
In many Tier 3 models, Monte Carlo analyses can be used to simulate the uncertainty arising from the large number 
of possible parameters in the systems.  Empirical analyses may also be an option to quantify uncertainty in model 
structure and parameterization based on an evaluation of model prediction error for sites with known inputs (See 
Box 2.2h). In general, uncertainties are quantified at national scales on annual time steps for reporting but may 
also be estimated at finer spatial and temporal scales. However, it may not be feasible or sensible to apply full 
Monte Carlo simulations to, for example, every spatial unit in a country. Given the computing resource and time 
requirements, it may also not be necessary to repeat a full Monte Carlo analysis every year. For example, in the 
case where only the activity data time series has been updated, but no other material changes to the inventory have 
been made, uncertainty estimates can be extrapolated to the additional years in the time series. A smaller test may 
also be run to demonstrate there has been no material change in uncertainty.

EXAMPLES OF QUANTIFICATION OF MODEL UNCERTAINTY 
This box is provided for information purposes and for the presentation of examples of quantification 
of uncertainties in Tier 3 modelling approaches. 
Canada 
Both uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted on Canada’s CBM-CFS3 integration 
framework (Metsaranta et al., 2017) and uncertainty analysis results are summarized below. 
A wide range of factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the model estimates were varied using 
Monte-Carlo simulations using the entire national system. These factors include the processes used 
to initialize dead organic matter and soil carbon pools, biomass increment data (a multiplier with a 
range of ±50 percent was applied to net biomass increment), activity data (wildfire (±10 percent), 
insects (±25 percent), and harvest (range varies by jurisdiction)), selection of stands during the 
allocation of natural disturbances to affected stands, and parameters defining litter input and dead 
organic matter pool dynamics. Parameter ranges for 32 biomass turnover and dead organic matter 
carbon modelling parameters were obtained from the literature and used as minimum and maximum 
values of triangular distributions (with mode set to the CBM-CFS3 default value). All parameter 
values and input data were varied independently, because the correlation structure among parameters 
could not be estimated. 
Input data for Canada’s 230 million ha of managed forest are contained in 20 CBM-CFS3 databases, 
each representing a specific region in Canada. Monte Carlo simulations for each of

EXAMPLES OF QUANTIFICATION OF MODEL UNCERTAINTY 
these 20 databases were conducted independently and the sample size for national totals was 
increased by summing random combinations of the 100 Monte Carlo runs from the 20 projects to 
generate 1000 randomly recombined estimates of national totals. The approximated 95 percent 
confidence interval (CI) was defined from the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of these national 
estimates. 
Under the assumptions of this analysis, the 95 percent confidence interval width averaged 32.2 Tg 
C·year−1 (+16.6 and –15.6 Tg C·year−1) for net biome production (total stock changes) relative to an 
overall simulation median of –0.8 Tg C·year−1 from 1990 to 2014. The largest sources of uncertainty 
were related to factors determining biomass increment and the parameters used to model soil and 
dead organic matter carbon dynamics. Some of these processes also vary in their intrinsic degree of 
predictability (Luo et al., 2015), and some factors causing large contributions to uncertainty may 
prove difficult to reduce (e.g., fine root turnover and its spatial and temporal variations). 
United States of America 
Uncertainty analysis for agricultural soil carbon and N2O emissions have been conducted for the US 
greenhouse gas inventory (Ogle et al. 2010; Del Grosso et al. 2010; US EPA, 2017). A Tier 3 method 
is applied to generate emissions estimates with application of the DayCent ecosystem model. This 
process-based model simulates plant production, soil organic matter formation, nutrient cycling, 
water flows, and temperature regimes (Parton et al. 1998). Uncertainty is quantified through a 
combination of Monte Carlo simulations, an empirical analysis of model prediction error, and 
propagation of variance associated with the land representation survey data. 
The inventory is compiled by simulating plant production and soil processes based on land use 
histories at about 400,000 locations that are part of a national survey, the National Resources 
Inventory (NRI) (Nusser et al. 1998, Nusser and Goebel 1997). The major input uncertainties in the 
Tier 3 model application are associated with fertilization and tillage management and are quantified 
in probability distribution functions (PDFs), representing the likelihood of different fertilization 
rates, tillage practices and manure amendments. The model is applied using a Monte Carlo Analysis 
in a series of 100 simulations for each NRI survey locations based on random draws from the PDFs. 
In turn, the analysis produces 100 estimates of soil C stock changes and N2O emissions for each 
survey location. 
Model prediction error, including bias and precision, is quantified in statistical models with an 
empirical analysis based on a comparison of model output to measured observations of soil C stocks 
and N2O emissions from experimental sites (Ogle et al. 2007).  The model inputs are mostly known 
for the DayCent model simulations of the experimental sites and so the primary sources of 
uncertainty that are quantified in this analysis are associated with model structure and 
parameterisation, in addition to the variance in measured observations. Moreover, the experimental 
sites are independent from model calibration allowing for an independent evaluation of model 
prediction error. The resulting empirical model is applied to the DayCent model output to adjust for 
biases, to the extent needed, and to quantify precision in model results. 
In a final step, variance associated with the NRI is derived based on the standard variance estimator 
for a stratified two-stage sample design (Särndal et al. 1992) and propagated through calculations to 
estimate national totals for the inventory (Ogle et al. 2010). The largest source of uncertainty in the 
analysis is associated with model structure and parameterization, as quantified in the empirical 
analysis.  This source accounts for more than 80 percent of the total uncertainty in soil carbon stock 
change and N2O emission estimates at the national scale, highlighting the importance of further 
improving the model to reduce uncertainty. 
Step 7. Verification of inventory estimates with independent data   
NGHGI estimates from Tier 3 models can be difficult to verify because alternative measurements often do not 
exist at the national scale. This is not unique to the AFOLU sector. There may however, be opportunities to verify 
component estimates against independent data.  For example, model derived estimates of crop yield, or timber 
harvest can be compared against independent data such as crop or timber production statistics. Such comparisons 
require a good understanding of the methods used for both the Tier 3 and the comparative estimates, to avoid 
interpreting possible discrepancies as an indicator of problems in the Tier 3 model, when the discrepancy is in fact 
due to methodological differences. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.66 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Another useful step in verification of inventory estimates is to compare current estimates against those in the 
inventory submissions of prior years. Changes in time series estimates that are not consistent with changes in 
activity or other input data should be examined and understood as these could be indicative of a variety of problems, 
including errors in data processing. Developing quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures that 
document the changes in estimates attributed to each change in input data, model parameters, or other 
methodological changes can assist inventory compilers in the verification of inventory estimates. 
Verification of inventory estimates can also be based on measurements from a monitoring network or from 
research sites that were not used to calibrate model parameters or evaluate model behaviour. The network would 
be similar in principle to a series of sites that are used for a measurement-based inventory. However, the 
uncertainty of the estimates (output) from a model-based approach does not depend directly on the sample size 
and therefore the sampling need not be as dense. In some cases, verification may demonstrate that the model-based 
estimation system is inappropriate due to large and unexplainable differences between model results and the 
measured trends from the monitoring network. Problems may stem from one of three possibilities: errors in the 
implementation step, poor input data, or an inappropriate model. Implementation problems typically arise from 
computer programming or data input errors, while model inputs may generate erroneous results if these data are 
not representative of management activity or environmental conditions. In these cases, it is good practice for the 
inventory compiler to return to either Steps 2 or 5 depending on the issue. It seems less likely that the model would 
be inappropriate if Step 2 was deemed reasonable. However, if this is the case, it is good practice to return to the 
model selection/development phase (Step 1) or to further refine the existing model.   
In addition to verifying inventory estimates, independent data may also be used to check areas estimates for land-
use and land use change including  
 
that land area is conserved over time;  
 
changes between land-use types are logical in terms of the type, frequency and time periods between changes, 
defined by the country;  
 
consistency between input data (e.g. area to be disturbed by disturbance type X) and model simulation results 
(e.g., area actually disturbed in the model by disturbance type X). 
Step 8. Reporting and Documentation   
It is good practice to assemble inventory results in a systematic and transparent manner for reporting purposes. 
Documentation of model-based Tier 3 inventory systems should include those items listed in Table 2.6b. For 
further details on QA/QC, reporting and documentation, see the sections dealing with the specific source categories

INTER-ANNUAL VARIABILITY 
In the AFOLU sector, the management of land is used as the best approximation of human influence and thus, 
estimates of emissions and removals on managed land are used as a proxy for anthropogenic emissions and 
removals on the basis that the preponderance of anthropogenic effects occurs on managed lands (see Vol. 4 Chapter 
1). This allows for consistency, comparability, and transparency in estimation. Referred to as the Managed Land 
Proxy (MLP), this approach is currently recognised by the IPCC as the only universally applicable approach to 
estimating anthropogenic emissions and removals in the AFOLU sector (IPCC 2006, IPCC 2010). However, it is 
also recognised that the estimated emissions and removals on managed lands can represent a combination of both 
anthropogenic (direct and indirect) and natural effects (Vol. 4 Chapter 1 p1.5; IPCC 2010; see Fig. 2.6A).  
Some of the emissions and removals from managed land are characterised by high interannual variability. 
Interannual variability (IAV) refers to the variability in the annual emissions and removals (E/R) estimates between 
years within a time series. In the AFOLU sector, the application of the MLP means that IAV can be caused by 
both anthropogenic and natural causes. The three main causes of IAV in GHG emissions and removals in the 
AFOLU sector are (1) natural disturbances (such as wildfires, insects, windthrow, and ice storms), which can cause 
large immediate and delayed emissions and kill trees; (2) climate variability (e.g. temperature, precipitation, and 
drought), which affects photosynthesis and respiration (Ciais et al. 2005; Aragão et al. 2018); and, (3) variation in 
the rate of human activities, including land use (such as forest harvesting), and land-use change (Stinson et al. 
2011; Pilli et al. 2016; Kurz et al. 2018).  
In some countries IAV in emissions from natural disturbances can be larger than the IAV of emissions caused by 
human activities such as forest management. For example, IAV in Canada’s 1990 to 2016 time series of annual 
emission and removals due to natural disturbances is much larger than the IAV in the emissions and removals on 
the remaining managed forest land (Figure 2.6C). The NGHGIs for Portugal (Figure 6-32 of Portugal’s NIR 2018 
(Portuguese Environmental Agency 2018)) and Australia (Table 6.21 of Australia’s NIR 2016 Volume 2 
(Commonwealth of Australia 2018)) are two other examples of time series with high IAV. In some countries, the 
areas burned by wildfires can vary by two orders of magnitude between years (Stinson et al. 2011; Miller et al. 
2012; Genet et al. 2018). In other countries, the majority of IAV may be due to human activities.  
When the MLP is used and the IAV in emissions and removals due to natural disturbances is large, it is difficult 
to gain a quantitative understanding of the role of human activities compared to the impacts of natural effects. In 
such situations, disaggregating9 MLP emissions and removals into those that are considered to result from human 
activities and those understood to result from natural effects may provide increased understanding of the emissions 
and removals that are due to human activities such as, land use (including harvesting) and land-use change. In this 
way, disaggregation can contribute to improved understanding of the trends in emission and removals due to 
human activities and mitigation actions that are taken to reduce anthropogenic emissions and preserve and enhance 
carbon stocks.  
Disaggregating emissions and removals according to anthropogenic and natural effects has been recognised as a 
scientific challenge (Canadell et al. 2007; Vetter et al. 2008; IPCC 2010; Kurz 2010; Smith 2010; Brando et al. 
2014; Henttonen et al. 2017). It is not yet possible to fully and accurately separate emissions and removals 
associated with human activity from those associated with natural effects. The last IPCC Expert Meeting Report 
on this topic encouraged further development of scientific methods (IPCC 2010).  
Recognizing that some but not all countries may choose to address emissions and removals from natural 
disturbances on managed land outside the inventory process, this guidance is provided as an option that may be 
used by countries that choose to disaggregate their reported MLP emissions and removals (i.e. all emissions and 
removals on managed land) into those that are considered to result from human activities and those that are 
considered to result from natural disturbances. These supplementary approaches may be of interest to countries 
with AFOLU sector emissions where IAV due to natural effects is large. The section first addresses definitional 
issues, followed by a description of whether or not different methodological approaches used to estimate C stock 
changes quantify the IAV of emissions and removals. A generic approach to report on disaggregation of the 
contribution of natural disturbances in reporting on total emissions and removals on managed lands is then 
provided, along with country-specific examples of methodological approaches to disaggregating anthropogenic 
effects and natural disturbances on managed lands.

Definitional issues 
2.6.1.1 DIRECT AND INDIRECT HUMAN EFFECTS, AND NATURAL 
EFFECTS 
Anthropogenic (i.e., direct and indirect human) effects and natural effects are described in Vol. 4 Chapter 1. Figure 
2.6a summarizes the main factors that cause these effects and their occurrences in managed and unmanaged lands. 
The specific effects included in estimates reported in NGHGIs depend on the estimation method and data used, 
which differ in approach and complexity among countries (see Table 2.6c). Describing how the various effects are 
reflected in the estimates of emissions and removals, based on the estimation method and data used, increases the 
transparency of the NGHGI and its understanding by the scientific and policy communities (Grassi et al. 2018, 
section 2.6.2). Useful information may include definition and spatial maps of managed land, information on areas 
of forest being harvested and those subject to other management, and information on the main determinants of the 
GHG fluxes (e.g., forest age structure, harvested volumes, harvest cycle). 
Figure 2.6a: 
Conceptual illustration of how various anthropogenic (direct and 
indirect) and natural factors affect land-related GHG emissions and 
removals in managed and unmanaged lands  (Source: Grassi et al. 
(2018)).  
 
Direct human-induced effects of any management activity on emissions or removals, by definition, only occur on 
managed lands. Indirect human-induced effects (i.e., the second order impacts of human activities on emissions or 
removals mediated through environmental change) and natural effects can occur on both unmanaged and managed 
lands. The “anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals by sinks are defined as all those occurring on ‘managed 
land’” (Vol. 4, Ch. 1). The natural effects “tend to average out over time and space” (Vol. 4, Ch. 1), provided 
that there are no trends in disturbance rates, such as increased annual area burned as a result of climate change. 
Nonetheless, their IAV in emissions and removals can have an important impact on annual NGHGIs. Depending 
on the estimation method and data used, GHG estimates for managed land may capture all or only some of this 
IAV (see Section 2.6.2).  
The IPCC describes the MLP as a method to approximate estimates of anthropogenic emissions and removals, but 
this proxy estimate also contains emissions and removals resulting from natural disturbances (IPCC 2006; IPCC 
2010). This section introduces an approach that countries can apply on a voluntary basis within the MLP in order 
to indicate those emissions and removals considered to result from human activity, and those that are understood 
to result from natural disturbances. This is achieved by disaggregating the estimated emissions and removals due 
to natural disturbances (ND E/R) within the estimated total MLP emissions and removals. This remaining 
aggregate of emissions and removals associated with human activity might still include some effects of IAV of 
natural disturbances and other natural effects on anthropogenic emissions and removals. 
2.6.1.2 NATURAL DISTURBANCES 
Disturbances, in particular wildfires, can contribute to large IAV in emissions. The number, frequency and 
intensity of fire events are strongly controlled by climate and weather, fuels, ignition sources, and human activities. 
High temperatures, past levels of fire suppression, and persistent drought events are key drivers of forest fires, for

instance in the Western US (Westerling 2016), in the Amazon region (Morton et al. 2013) or in Indonesia (Schimel 
et al. 2015). However, land use and land-use change such as deforestation and peatland drainage can influence the 
likelihood and impacts of fire (Page & Hooijer 2016). In the Brazilian Cerrado, severe drought events explain the 
loss of almost 30 percent of aboveground woody biomass (de Miranda et al. 2014). Other natural disturbances 
with large IAV include storm damage (Yamashita et al. 2002; Lindner et al. 2010). Insects tend to follow outbreak 
cycles, thus causing more long-term trends that contribute to interdecadal rather than interannual variations (Kurz 
et al. 2008; Hicke et al. 2012). However, like IAV, the inter-decadal variability can also make it difficult to identify 
trends in emissions and removals that result from human activities. 
Definition of natural disturbances 
Natural disturbances in the context of the AFOLU sector are non-anthropogenic events or non-anthropogenic 
circumstances that cause significant emissions and are beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by a 
country. These include wildfires, insect and disease infestations, extreme weather events and/or geological 
disturbances, beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by a country. Natural disturbances exclude 
human activities such as harvesting, prescribed burning and fires associated with activities such as slash and burn.10  
Non-anthropogenic events refer to non-human induced events (e.g. fire initiated by lightening, damage by wind 
storms), non-anthropogenic circumstances refer to non-human induced conditions that exacerbate these 
disturbances (e.g., fire occurring during particularly harsh conditions like strong winds, high temperature, drought, 
etc.). For information on how to document that disturbances are beyond the control of and not materially influenced 
by the country, see Section 2.6.4 below.  
The methodological guidance provided in this section is aimed at disaggregating emissions and removals in 
ecosystems where natural disturbances cause large IAV in emissions within the MLP and where subsequent 
removals occur over a multi-year period of time. Therefore, this methodological guidance is applicable to natural 
disturbances in forests, and in woody grassland, undrained wetlands or undrained peatlands, but not in other land 
categories where human actions materially determine and/or deeply influence the conditions and circumstances 
associated with significant emissions by disturbances (such in drained peatlands and in cropland).  
Balance of emissions and subsequent removals 
A fundamental assumption under the MLP is that carbon emissions and removals associated with natural effects 
will average out over space and time (see also Volume 4, Chapter 1). Therefore, consistent with this assumption, 
the CO2 emissions (from above and below ground biomass, dead organic matter and soil carbon) from areas 
affected by natural disturbances are expected to be balanced by subsequent removals across the landscape at some 
future point in time. This expectation has no established time limit because the time to balance depends on the 
types of ecosystems affected by disturbances and their rates of regrowth.  
At stand level, changes in growing conditions could affect this expectation, in particular if environmental 
conditions contribute to regeneration failure of stands that were affected by natural disturbances, e.g. landslides 
and erosion after wildfire, making it more difficult to achieve the balance. Conversely, if environmental changes 
contribute to increased growth rates or reduced mortality rates, then the balance will be achieved faster.  In the 
case of repeated disturbances on the same area, the time to reach balance for that area may increase. 
2.6.2 
Relationship 
between 
different 
methodological 
approaches and the representation of emissions and 
removals from interannual variability 
The choice of estimation method and data affects the extent to which the IAV of different drivers is reflected in 
reported estimates (see Table 2.6c). Countries can apply different estimation methods to report their emissions and 
removals capturing the anthropogenic components with different temporal resolution and disaggregation of 
variables (annual to periodic, averaged or disaggregated by drivers). Table 2.6c provides information on how the 
choice of estimation method affects whether or not factors contributing to IAV of reported emissions and removals 
are captured in NGHGIs. This table may help countries in understanding and describing how the various effects 
are reflected in the estimates of emissions and removals, therefore increasing the understanding of NGHGIs by the 
scientific and policy communities.

The Stock Difference method calculates net emissions/removals (E/R) as the difference in estimated C stocks for 
relevant pools measured at two points in time. Average annual net E/R can be calculated by dividing the C stock 
difference of a period by the number of years between the two observations. Periodic stock assessments without 
auxiliary data therefore do not allow the quantification of the IAV of emissions and removals and its relation to 
the various drivers.  
With annual measurements of ecosystem carbon stocks, e.g. via subsets of annual plot measurements in a 
continuous forest inventory, the quantification of IAV of emissions and removals becomes possible. Periodic or 
annual subsets of inventories can by themselves not detect IAV unless auxiliary data – such as area annually burned, 
harvest rates or other specific plot-level measurements on the timing of tree mortality – are used to inform about 
IAV (Röhling et al. 2016). For non-CO2 emissions (e.g., CH4 and N2O from fires), auxiliary data on the type of 
disturbance that caused carbon losses would be required when the stock difference method is used.  
The Gain-Loss method requires annual data on forest management, land-use change and natural disturbances and 
when these are available it can provide estimates of the IAV of net emissions. Depending on the estimation 
methodology and the data sets used, it may capture some or all of the impacts of drivers of the IAV of annual 
emissions and removals. A Gain-Loss approach utilising yield tables or constant emission factors (EF) will be 
insensitive to natural climate variability and, therefore, will only be able to distinguish between the direct human 
impact and natural disturbance impacts on IAV of emissions and removals. Gain-Loss methods that utilise climate-
sensitive growth and mortality models (Richards & Evans 2004; Waterworth et al. 2007; Hember et al. 2018), or 
                                                           
11 Forest inventories with multi-year period remeasurement and no auxiliary data cannot detect IAV. In some cases, periodic 
measurements on permanent sample plots are augmented with additional annual data thus increasing the ability to estimate 
IAV. 
12 Forest inventories with annual remeasurements for the same plots can detect IAV but are rarely implemented. 
13 The assumption for the Gain-Loss method is that activity data such as harvest, land-use change, and natural disturbances are 
available annually.

climate sensitive models of dead and soil organic matter dynamics (see Figure 6 in Liski et al. (2006)) can, in 
addition, estimate the indirect human and natural climate variability impacts on the IAV of emissions and removals.  
2.6.3 
Optional approach for reporting of emissions and 
removals from Natural Disturbances 
It is good practice for countries to apply the MLP and to estimate and report all emissions and removals that occur 
on managed lands. This section describes a generic approach for use by countries that choose to report on the 
further disaggregation of emissions and subsequent removals from natural disturbances from the total emissions 
and removals estimated using the MLP. As discussed above, disturbances may have a natural and an anthropogenic 
component. This reporting guidance aims to assist countries choosing to report on the disaggregation of emissions 
and subsequent removals associated with human activity and those associated with natural disturbances within the 
total emissions and subsequent removals estimates of the MLP. 
The elements of a generic approach are provided below, followed by examples of how the approach has been 
implemented to date:  
1. Quantification of the total emissions and removals from Managed Lands (consistent with MLP) 
Estimate total E/R consistent with the MLP. Guidance provided by the IPCC for each relevant land category 
applies for the estimation of associated emissions and subsequent removals due to regrowth within the MLP. 
This is the total MLP flux, i.e. the first order approximation of the anthropogenic emissions and removals, 
which also includes emissions and subsequent removals from areas that are identified as subject to natural 
disturbances. 
2. Reporting on the country-specific approach to applying the definition of natural disturbances 
Consistent with the generic definition of natural disturbances provided in section 2.6.1.2, countries describe 
their approach when applying the definition of natural disturbances consistently over time. The country 
description includes the types of disturbances for which the disaggregation of emissions and subsequent 
removals is implemented. The description also explains how the country excludes from natural disturbances 
the impacts of human activities, e.g., salvage logging, prescribed burning, slash and burn and deforestation. 
3. Identification of emissions and removals due to natural disturbances 
The emissions and subsequent removals associated with natural disturbances are identified by applying the ND 
definition to either the individual (stand-level) disturbed areas or the total (landscape-level) emissions from all 
disturbances in the year14. In identifying those emissions and removals, it is good practice to avoid the inclusion 
of emissions and removals that are materially affected by human actions15.  Both approaches provide for the: 
(i) Identification of the lands and area of land affected by each disturbance, as well as a description of the 
methods and criteria applied. 
(ii) For those lands, estimation of the emissions and subsequent removals associated with natural 
disturbances only (e.g. salvage logging emissions and associated subsequent removals are not included), 
as well as a description of the methods and criteria applied. 
If a country chooses to disaggregate ND emissions and removals, then it is good practice to disaggregate as 
anthropogenic the emissions and subsequent removals associated with management activities occurring on land 
affected by natural disturbances, including salvage logging and deforestation. Consequently, subsequent 
removals are disaggregated between human activities and natural disturbances, proportionally to the C stock 
losses these activities have caused, until the CO2 emissions from natural disturbances are balanced by removals.  
For example, if salvage logging follows wildfire, and the wildfire caused instant emissions of 20 t CO2 per 
hectare and subsequent salvage logging caused an additional 40 t CO2, then 20 t CO2 of subsequent removals 
are disaggregated as natural disturbances, and all remaining removals are disaggregated as anthropogenic 
effects.  This could be implemented sequentially (i.e. the first 20 t CO2 removals are disaggregated as due to 
natural causes, and all subsequent removals to anthropogenic causes) or in parallel (i.e. in this example, for 
every tonne of CO2 removal, one third is disaggregated as due to natural causes, and the remaining two thirds 
to anthropogenic causes). In both cases, once natural emissions are balanced by removals disaggregated as 
natural causes, the remaining removals are considered anthropogenic.   
                                                           
14 Methodological guidance on quantification of associated emissions and removals are given in the chapters with general 
guidance (Chapter 2 and 3) as well in the category-specific chapters (Chapter 4 and 6)". 
15 Noting that a portion of the emissions and removals considered to be associated with natural disturbances may be affected 
by human actions. 
Volume 4: Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
2.72 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Disaggregation of CO2 removals following natural disturbances can be implemented at the landscape level by 
apportioning these based on, for instance, the proportion of area disturbed of total forest area and the proportion 
of C stock lost of total C stock. For example, if in a year X in a country Y, Z ha of forest land is subject to 
wildfires, representing 0.1percent of the total forest area and 25percent of the total carbon stock present in the 
burned area is lost; the percentage of total CO2 removals in the entire forest land apportioned to natural 
disturbances in this example is 0.025percent (i.e., 0.1percent*25percent) for year X. If the emissions from 
natural disturbances in year X were 25 Mt CO2, then the removals in subsequent years are considered natural 
until the sum of the removals equals that amount. 
Although the different approaches above (i.e., sequential or parallel disaggregation of removals subsequent to 
natural disturbances, stand vs. landscape level) affect the annual disaggregation, as long as the expectation of 
the balance between emissions from natural disturbances and the subsequent removals is fulfilled (see Section 
6.2.1.2), and as long as emissions and subsequent removals are treated consistently, in the long term the totals 
are the same. Furthermore, in all cases it is good practice to report information on assumptions and methods 
implemented to disaggregate subsequent CO2 removals. 
When land-use change (e.g., forest land converted to cropland) follows a natural disturbance (e.g., wildfire), 
then emissions associated with land-use changes after natural disturbances as well as the emissions from the 
prior natural disturbance, are considered to be anthropogenic emissions. If regrowth occurs on that land, then 
any subsequent removals are also considered anthropogenic.  
4. Disaggregation of the MLP 
The natural disturbance component is subtracted from the total estimate of MLP emissions and removals, 
yielding an estimate of the emissions and removals associated with human activity on managed land. Both 
components are estimated and reported as part of the total MLP emissions and removals. In countries where 
natural disturbance contributes large IAV to E/R, the component of the MLP emissions and removals identified 
as associated with human activity is expected to have a lower IAV than the MLP emissions and removals 
because the variability resulting from natural disturbances has been disaggregated. 
Given the expectation of the balance described above (Section 2.6.1.2), when emissions from natural 
disturbances are disaggregated, it is good practice that subsequent removals are also disaggregated until the 
balance has been reached. In this case, it is also good practice to disaggregate to the natural disturbance 
component those removals in each inventory year that are contributed by lands that were affected by natural 
disturbances prior to the start of the time series. In many ecosystems it may take decades for removals following 
natural disturbances to balance emissions from the disturbances. If it is not possible to estimate directly the 
amount of emissions that need to be balanced, for example if natural disturbances occurred before the reporting 
period, the time when the balance is expected can be approximated based on the estimated length (years) of 
the recovery period (see example in Box 2.2j). This ensures a consistent application of the balance principle 
throughout the time series.  
In addition to CO2 emissions, natural disturbances may cause non-CO2 emissions, e.g. wildfires cause N2O and 
CH4 emissions. While CO2 emissions are assumed to average out across time because of vegetation regrowth 
after disturbance, non-CO2 emissions are not taken up by vegetation and therefore there is no expectation that 
these emissions will be balanced by removals because the biological, chemical and physical processes that 
result in the complete decay of CH4 and N2O in the atmosphere are not captured in existing IPCC inventory 
methods. 
Examples of methodological approaches that have been developed are presented for Australia (Box 2.2i), Canada 
(Box 2.2j) and for an EU country (Box 2.2k).

BOX 2.2I (NEW) 
AUSTRALIAN APPROACH TO ESTIMATING INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY DUE TO NATURAL DISTURBANCES 
This box is for information only and neither adds guidance nor overrules guidance provided. 
In Australia, all lands are considered managed lands. All areas and carbon stock changes on managed 
land from anthropogenic and ‘natural disturbances’16 are reported, consistent with the MLP. ‘Natural 
disturbance’ emissions and removals are considered to be caused by non-anthropogenic events and 
circumstances beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, human activity despite 
extensive efforts by emergency management organizations to prevent, manage and control such 
events. 
Both initial carbon losses and subsequent recoveries in carbon stocks are modelled as part of the 
disturbance event, and carbon stocks are spatially tracked until pre-disturbance levels are reached to 
ensure completeness and balance in reporting. Most Australian wildfires are not stand-replacing and 
carbon stocks typically recover after 11 years (Roxburgh et al. 2015). Estimates are prepared using 
a process (hybrid) model with DOM/SOM dynamics with variable climate (FullCAM).  
‘Natural disturbances’ are defined as occurring in a year which is an outlier (exceeding the 95percent 
probability level) in the series of annual carbon stock losses due to wildfire at the national level and, 
spatially, as fires in those regions (States) experiencing abnormal fire activity in that year. (A full 
description of the method to identify outliers can be found in Volume 2 of Australia’s NIR 2016 - 
Section 6.4.1.3) 
‘Natural disturbance’ emissions and removals are modelled on a spatial basis and, consistent with 
the MLP, included in reporting after averaging out initial carbon stock losses and subsequent 
recovery17. This leaves the trend in carbon stock changes as the dominant result of human activity 
(e.g. from prescribed burning, normal seasonal wildfires – see “B” in Figure 2.6B).   
The approach ensures that Australia’s modelled implementation of the MLP is comparable with 
estimates generated using other methods, such as Tier 3 stock-difference approaches, that tend to 
average out IAV due to natural causes over space (scaling from plots to region) and time (averaging 
between periodic re-measurements). All carbon stock changes on managed land from anthropogenic 
and natural disturbances are transparently reported in Australia’s NIR.

CANADA’S APPROACH TO ESTIMATING  INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY FROM NATURAL DISTURBANCES 
This box is for information only and neither adds guidance nor overrules guidance provided. 
In the 2017 National GHG Inventory Report18 Canada revised its reporting approach to increase the 
transparency of the reporting of anthropogenic emissions and removals on Forest Land remaining 
Forest Land (FL-FL). The new approach disaggregated the emissions and subsequent removals on 
managed lands affected by natural disturbances from those on the remaining lands subject to forest 
management. The concept of the MLP was maintained: the sum of these two emission and removal 
components are identical to the total emissions and removals for FL-FL under the MLP. Canada’s 
2018 National GHG Inventory Report19 further refined the approach. The methods are described in 
detail by (Kurz et al. 2018) and are summarized here. 
Canada defined natural disturbances as all stand-replacing wildfires and all disturbances of other 
natural causes (insects, windthrow etc.) that result in more than 20 percent tree mortality (biomass) 
in affected stands. The threshold of 20 percent was selected because large areas of forests are affected 
by insects that cause low levels of mortality and/or growth reductions. Disturbances with impacts 
below this threshold are considered part of the natural, small-scale forest mortality that affect stand 
dynamics such as self-thinning. 
For all areas affected by stand-replacing fire disturbances, annual CO2 and non-CO2 GHG emissions 
and subsequent CO2 removals are summarized in the natural disturbance land category for several 
decades following the fire event.  The time at which stands affected by natural disturbances transition 
back to the category of lands affected by forest management varies across Canada and is determined 
by the age at which stands are eligible for harvest, typically 60 to 90 years. For other natural 
disturbances that cause more than 20 percent biomass mortality, E/R are summarised in the natural 
disturbance category until the pre-disturbance biomass values are reached. For the 1990 to 2016 time 
series, stands regenerating following wildfire that are younger than the age at which stands are 
eligible for harvest is summarised in the natural disturbance category: removals that occur after 1989 
in stands that have been affected by stand-replacing wildfires prior to 1990 are therefore contributing 
to balancing emissions from wildfires that occurred since 1990. The 56 Mha of managed forest 
affected by wildfire disturbances prior to 1990 contribute in 1990 estimated removals of 64 Mt CO2e 
yr-1. From 1990 to 1994 these cumulative annual removals are larger than the emissions from 
wildfires since 1990, making the lands subject to natural disturbances net sinks  (Kurz et al. 2018). 
This approach contributes to balanced reporting as otherwise only removals from stands affected by 
natural disturbances after 1990 would appear in the natural disturbance component. 
The disaggregation of fluxes improves the estimate of human impacts: reported emissions and 
removals without natural disturbances showed clear temporal trends that are correlated with changes 
in the rates of human activities such as rates of clear-cut harvesting (Figure 2.6C). In areas strongly 
affected by the Mountain Pine Beetle outbreak (Kurz et al. 2008) the trend in emissions reported for 
lands affected by forest management is still somewhat influenced by the impacts of the beetle 
because that area is decreasing  (Kurz et al. 2018).  The high IAV resulting primarily from fires is 
reported separately (Table 6.5 in Canada’s NIR 2018). Further methodological details are provided 
in Canada’s NIR 2018, Sections 6.3.1 and in Annex 3.5.2.3 and in (Kurz et al. 2018). 
 
                                                           
greenhouse gas emissions and removals by sinks tends to average out over time and space. This leaves the greenhouse gas 
emission and removals from managed lands as the dominant result of human activity.”

APPROACH TO ESTIMATING INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY FROM NATURAL DISTURBANCES BASED ON THE EU 
LEGISLATION20 
This box is for information only and neither adds guidance nor overrules guidance provided. This 
example demonstrates a methodological approach that has not yet been implemented. 
Forests of example country Z21 are prone to wildfires that in years with extreme weather conditions 
(e.g. drought, especially if combined with strong winds) may cause large emissions from biomass 
burning and cause high IAV in the net CO2 balance. Although, the country recognizes that most of 
its wildfires are human-induced either intentionally, e.g. pyromaniacs, or unintentionally, e.g. 
campfires, fireworks, cigarettes or other causes, some have natural causes. Consequently, emissions 
from wildfires have both an anthropogenic and a natural component. 
 
Figure 2.6d: Time series of managed forest land total GHG net emission (anthropogenic + natural 
disturbance (ND) and area burned. Blue bars (left Y-axis) represent annual total net GHG emission 
(Gg CO2e) from managed forest land net sink. The dashed red line (right Y-axis) represents the 
annual area burned (kha). 
To disaggregate the natural component of emissions and removals from wildfires, the country uses 
its national definition of natural disturbances: Natural Disturbances are those wildfires that are non-
anthropogenic events or non-anthropogenic circumstances that cause significant emissions in 
forests and are beyond the control of, and not materially influenced by, the Country’s land use and 
management practices. These practices exclude salvage logging and prescribed burning.  
All wildfires are considered not materially influenced by the country’s land use and management 
practices since the use of fire is forbidden in any forest land and the country has an advanced national 
fire management system for fire prevention, fire monitoring and fire suppression in all land uses, 
including forest land.  
To identify wildfires that cause significant emissions and are beyond the control of the country’s 
fire management system and are therefore considered natural disturbances, the country looks for 
statistical outliers that fall outside the 95 percent confidence interval of the variability of the 
historical time series of the annual GHG emissions from wildfires22. To do so, the distribution of 
emissions from wildfires is established, and it is assumed that all values within the normal 
 
                                                           
20 The presented methodology is based on the EU Regulation 2018/841 
21 Data for this example are derived from the Italian GHG inventory 
22 Such time series do not include emissions from salvage logging nor emissions from wildfires that are followed by a 
deforestation event. The time series can start before the base year of the country and may include all years for which data are 
available. For this example, the time series starts in 1971.

LEGISLATION 
distribution are exclusively associated with the anthropogenic component23, any outlier value, in the 
upper tail, is considered as the signal of a disturbance event that is unlikely to have been generated 
by anthropogenic causes alone and therefore includes a natural component. 
In practice, first a historical time series of annual emissions24 from wildfires is constructed starting 
from 1971, i.e., the base year (1990) of the NGHGI of the country minus 20 years. Then, using an 
iterative process, outliers (if any) that are larger than the mean plus two times 25 the standard 
deviation are removed from the time series in successive iterations, until an outlier-free normal 
distribution is obtained.  
The resulting time series, as well as its mean (referred to below as the background level of 
anthropogenic emissions from wildfires) and two times its standard deviation (referred to below as 
the margin) excludes all outliers. Based on these statistics, natural disturbances are those that occur 
in years when the total immediate emissions from wildfires are larger than the background level plus 
the margin and emissions from these natural disturbances are quantified as the amount exceeding 
the background level. This amount is disaggregated from the anthropogenic component.  
To establish the balance between immediate CO2 emissions (F) and total subsequent CO2 removals26 
(R) due to natural disturbances, and to avoid introducing artificial trends to the time series, the 
country also estimates and reports removals occurring from land disturbed in the X years prior to 
the inventory year, where X27 is the length of the period that is needed for forest vegetation (by 
relevant forest types and site types) to recover the pre-disturbance C stock. The CO2 removals are 
quantified under the assumption that forest vegetation fully recovers within X years after wildfires. 
This assumption is based on the current legislation that forbids conversion of burnt forests to other 
land uses and that prescribes post-fire management activities aimed at rehabilitating the pre-fire 
forest vegetation. Consequently, the average amount of subsequent annual removals (Rannual) to be 
disaggregated for X years of a past ND event28 is equivalent to

𝑋 and ∑ 𝑅𝑎𝑙���𝑙���𝑢𝑎𝑙 = 𝑅 = 𝐹

is the year in which the natural disturbances occur and X the time needed for C stocks to recover to 
their pre-disturbance level). 
 
                                                           
23 The average value of this distribution is the so -called background level of emissions associated with disturbances and it is 
considered anthropogenic. 
24 The country includes the emissions of fire events only, delayed emissions associated with the decay of biomass that was 
killed during the fire are not considered 
25 This is an approximation of Student’s t value for data series with number of data >= 30. 
26 Calculated directly from the biomass net increment (ΔCG of IPCC equation 2.7) 
27 For this example, X has been estimated to be 20 years for the entire country’s territory. 
28 This means that in any year Y of the NGHGI the amount of CO2 removals to be disaggregated is equivalent to the

land; red bars (source and green line (sink)) disaggregated GHG emissions and subsequent CO2

of the time series is 0.184.  
2.6.4 
Reporting the contribution of natural disturbances 
and anthropogenic effects to the emissions and 
removals for managed lands 
Voluntary disaggregation of the total of emissions and removals in the MLP into those that are associated with 
human effects and those due to natural disturbances may provide a clearer picture of the impact of management 
activities. It is understood that a complete separation of the direct human impacts from natural impacts is, at this 
time, not possible due to limitations of scientific methods (IPCC 2010) but disaggregating the emissions and 
subsequent removals that are associated with natural disturbances on managed lands may be a helpful first step. 
The MLP total is the sum of all emissions and removals on managed land. Box 2.2l describes a possible approach 
to reporting the total E/R from MLP plus the two components from: 
1. Natural disturbances; 
2. Anthropogenic activities (direct and indirect human effects). 
The first component includes emissions from natural disturbances and subsequent net removals from regrowth. 
Emissions may include delayed emissions from dead organic matter that was added by the disturbance to the 
already existing dead organic matter pools.  
The second component includes emissions and removals directly and indirectly associated with human activity 
calculated as the difference between MLP total emissions and removals minus those associated with natural 
disturbances.  
In those cases where natural disturbance fluxes are large compared to the anthropogenic component of the MLP, 
the optional disaggregation of estimates of the emissions and removals associated with natural disturbances can 
identify the estimated trends of the emissions and removals on managed land associated with human activity, as 
demonstrated in recent NGHGI reports (e.g., Boxes 2.2I, 2.2J).

Transparency:  
For those countries that choose to identify, quantify and report disaggregated natural disturbance emissions and 
subsequent removals, it is good practice to document disaggregated emissions and removals in the MLP, and the 
approaches, assumptions and methods used.  
It is good practice to document the following: 
 Consistency of the country approach with the generic definition of natural disturbances provided in Section 
2.6.1.2, if any.  
 The types of natural disturbances for which emissions and subsequent removals are identified, quantified and 
disaggregated within MLP reporting. 
 How the requirements associated with the above definition of natural disturbances are met, including that the 
identified ND events are “non-anthropogenic events or non-anthropogenic circumstances”, which can be 
demonstrated by providing information to show that the disturbances were “not materially influenced by, and 
beyond the control of, a country”.  
 How the emissions and removals that are materially influenced by human actions are excluded from the natural 
disturbances component. 
The demonstration that natural disturbances were “not materially influenced by, and beyond the control of, a 
country” is based on scientific reasoning or evidence and documentation on practicable efforts to prevent, manage 
or control the occurrences that led to the natural disturbances. Such evidence and practicable efforts may include 
but are not limited to: 
 Studies showing the prevalent direct cause of fires in a given region, forest type and climate zone; information 
on weather conditions related to the disturbance events or to the cumulative affected areas; 
 Application of preventative measures or modifying factors related to the occurrence or propagation of the 
disturbances that may reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of the disturbances occurring; 
 Efforts to manage or control the disturbances when they occur, to the extent possible.  
It is good practice to document the methods used to identify, quantify and disaggregate the impact of ND on GHG 
emissions and removals, including information on:  
 How the method is consistent with the expectation that the CO2 emissions from areas affected by natural 
disturbance will be balanced by subsequent removals.  
 The methods by which GHG fluxes are disaggregated from total MLP fluxes.  
 For lands subject to ND, documentation on how subsequent land use and land-use change, if any, is identified 
and how GHG fluxes previously disaggregated as associated with natural disturbances are re-assigned to the 
anthropogenic component following land-use change.  
Documentation on the manner in which emissions associated with human activities that occur after the natural 
disturbance event (such as salvage logging and site rehabilitation or other activities that do not cause a land-use to 
change), and subsequent removals, are estimated and disaggregated.

Default Mineral Soil Reference C Stocks 
Data presented in Table 2.3 were derived from Batjes (2011) and Batjes (2010) unless no values were available 
for particular combinations of IPCC Climate Zones and IPCC soil types. Where no values were available, values 
were taken from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas or the 1996 IPCC Guidelines.  
Reference C Stocks for the mineral soils C method were derived for IPCC climate zones (IPCC 2006 p. 3.39)  and 
IPCC soil classes (IPCC 2006 pp. 3.40-3.41). Soil data are from the ISRIC-WISE database (10250 profiles) 
complimented with 1900 additional geo-referenced profiles from under represented temperate and boreal sites.  
Data from all soils were screened and where organic carbon contents were determined using the Walkley Black 
analysis, values were adjusted based on a conversion factor of 1.3 to estimate corresponding values that would 
have been obtained by dry combustion analysis.  Profiles were collected between 1925 and 2010 with two-thirds 
of the pedons sampled between 1955 and 1995. Profiles were classified as “cultivated or disturbed” vs 
“(semi)natural”. Only profiles flagged as being under native vegetation (classified as “(semi)natural”) were 
included (a total of 5560 profiles equating to approximately 1.6 times that used in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines). The 
profiles also had a better geographical distribution across the globe compared to those use to derive reference 
carbon stock values within the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.

Additional Information for the Estimation of Soil 
Carbon Stock Change from Biochar Amendments 
to Mineral Soils Using Tier 2 and 3 Methods 
Thermochemical Conversion Technologies 
For the purpose of this methodology, biochar is defined as a solid material generated by heating biomass to a 
temperature in excess of 350 °C under conditions of controlled and limited oxidant concentrations to prevent 
combustion. These processes can be classified as either pyrolysis (in which oxidants are excluded), or gasification 
(in which oxidant concentrations are low enough to generate syngas).  
Torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonisation (also called liquefaction) are not included because they do not 
generate solid products that are significantly more persistent in soil than the original organic feedstock material 
(Libra et al. 2011; Kammann et al. 2012). Both of these processes typically utilise temperatures below 350°C, 
with torrefaction operating under dry feedstock conditions in ambient pressure, while hydrothermal carbonisation 
uses pressurised wet aqueous slurries. In contrast, pyrolysis operates at temperatures at 350°C and above (typically 
but not always below 700°C) under variable times, and gasification utilises temperatures between 500 and 1500°C 
and typically short times (Boateng et al. 2015), both in dry conditions.  Dry conditions are defined here in terms 
of the feedstock moisture, whereby feedstocks can have moisture up to 20percent after pre-drying; in comparison, 
wet slurries typically have liquid water contents above 80percent. 
Priming of native soil organic carbon by biochar amendments 
Mineralisation of native soil organic carbon is on average reduced by 4 percent (95 percent CI = -8.1–0.8percent) 
after biochar additions to soil (Wang et al. 2015). Similar to laboratory trials (Kuzyakov et al. 2014), field trials 
also show reductions in mineralisation of native soil organic carbon close to a decade after biochar additions (Weng 
et al. 2017) as well as in biochar-rich soils after several millennia (Liang et al. 2010). Known mechanisms that 
would cause an increase in mineralisation involve co-metabolism (Whitman et al. 2015) that operates over the 
short term by supplying easily mineralisable organic matter as a source of energy to metabolise native organic 
matter (Zimmerman et al. 2011). Conservatively, we assume no effect of biochar on existing soil organic matter 
in the long term.   
Nitrous oxide emissions from soil after biochar amendments 
Meta-analyses have found that nitrous oxide emissions are on average reduced between 54 percent (Cayuela et al. 
2014), 38 percent (Borchard et al. 2018), 32 percent (Liu et al. 2018) to 0 percent (Verhoeven et al. 2017) after 
addition of biochar to soil. Any reductions in nitrous oxide emissions due to biochar additions typically decline 
over several years after application (Fungo et al. 2017). Furthermore, assessments of nitrous oxide emissions 
several years after biochar additions are indicative of long-term emission reductions although at lower rates, since 
changes in biochar properties occur slowly over long periods of time (decades and centuries) compared to changes 
observed during the initial days to years (Nguyen et al. 2008).  
High-N feedstocks generate biochar with some microbially available N (Wang et al. 2012) and can lead to short-
term (days to weeks) increases in total nitrous oxide emissions if produced at lower temperatures (< 600 °C) 
(Cayuela et al. 2013). However, charring consistently reduces nitrous oxide emissions originating from the 
nitrogen in nitrogen-rich organic materials (Rose et al. 2016), as easily mineralisable amino-groups are converted 
to polyaromatic nitrogen-carbon structures (Knicker 2007).  
Due to limiting evidence demonstrating the long-term persistence of soil nitrous oxide emission reductions, it is 
conservatively assumed that biochar does not reduce nitrous oxide emissions from soil in the Tier 1 method.  
However, any bioavailable N additions associated with biochar amendments should be included in the calculations 
of direct and indirect soil nitrous oxide emissions (Volume 4, Chapter 11) as part of organic N inputs. This 
approach will be conservative in terms of the influence of biochar on greenhouse gas emissions for the Tier 1 
method. 
Biochar Amendments to Organic Soils 
No methods are provided in this guidance for estimating the impact of amending organic soils with biochar.  
Compilers may be able to develop a Tier 3 method for estimating the impact of biochar C amendments to organic 
soils, but it is important to recognise that the dynamics may be different, particularly with respect to priming. Few 
studies have investigated the impact of priming by biochar on organic soils. However, one study that has 
investigated priming of organic horizons in a forest soil found substantial losses of soil C over a ten-year period 
with charcoal additions (Wardle et al. 2008). Wardle et al. (2008) did not use isotopes and were therefore unable 
to attribute these losses unequivocally to the organic soil C or to the charcoal. Nor was their study able to determine 
the extent to which enhanced mass loss of organic soil carbon was due to mineralisation, or was due to vertical 
transport of the C into the soil column as dissolved or colloidal organic carbon (Lehmann & Sohi 2008). 
Nonetheless, the Wardle et al. (2008) study did indicate the possibility that priming of soil organic matter 
decomposition by biochar may lead to a net loss of soil C in organic soils.
