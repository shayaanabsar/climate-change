NMVOCs are emitted during the production of alcoholic beverages,
breadmaking and other food products.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
The emission estimates are based on the total annual production of the
particular food manufacturing process. National production statistics for
alcoholic beverages broken down into a minimum of wine, beer and spirits
are required.  The Standard Nomenclature for Air Pollution (SNAP)
numbers for food and drink are: alcoholic beverages (40606 - 40608) and
breadmaking and other food products (40605).
For the breadmaking and other food production, national production
statistics broken down into the categories listed in Table 2-26 are required.

NMVOC are released during the heating of fats and oils and foodstuffs
containing them, the baking of cereals, flour and beans, fermentation in
bread making, the cooking of vegetables and meats, and the drying of
residues.  Food production is divided into seven categories, each with its
own emission factor.  The emission factors given in the EMEP/CORINAIR

I n t r o d u c t i o n
Atmospheric release of materials may be the result of by-product emissions
during manufacture or from fugitive releases.  A fugitive emission is an
emission that is not controlled or contained, such as a leak from a flange or
coupling.
D a t a  S o u r c e s
The type of data required depends on the level of effort that is to be
expended and the accuracy required.  For the simpler methodology that
uses an emission factor, data on production should be available from
chemical companies. For the more detailed approach, plant specific emission
information is required.

It is estimated that the HFC-23 released, as a by-product during manufacture
of HCFC-22, is currently equivalent to 4 per cent of the production of
HCFC-22 assuming no abatement measures, although lower figures have
been suggested.
This factor, or a similar number derived for the particular country's
circumstances, can be used to estimate national emissions of HFC-23 from
the total national HCFC-22 production (for both potentially dispersive and
feedstock end-uses).

Fugitive emissions of a chemical may occur both during the production and
the distribution of a chemical.  For this section, fugitive emissions associated
with use are not addressed as they are covered in the section related to
consumption (see Section 2.17).  In the case of fluorocarbon processes,
fugitive emissions have been estimated to be approximately 0.5 per cent of
the total production of each compound (UNEP, 1994).
This factor, or a similar number derived for the particular country's
circumstances, can be used to estimate national fugitive emissions of
individual HFCs and PFCs associated with national production.

of Haloc arbons (HFCs, PFCs) and

I n t r o d u c t i o n
The chemicals (HFCs, PFCs, SF6) are of concern, because they have high
global warming potentials and long atmospheric residence times.
Current and expected application areas of HFCs and PFCs include:
-
refrigeration and air conditioning
-
fire suppression and explosion protection
-
aerosols
-
solvent cleaning
-
foam blowing
-
other applications1
Primary uses of SF6 include:
-
gas insulated switch gear and circuit breakers
-
fire suppression and explosion protection
-
other applications2
                                                     
     1 HFCs and PFCs may be used in sterilisation equipment, for tobacco
expansion applications, and as solvents in the manufacture of adhesives,
coating, and inks.
     2 SF6 may be used as an insulating medium, a tracer, in leak detectors,
and in various electronic applications.  For SF6 consumption in magnesium
and aluminium foundries, see Section 2.13.6.1.
THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL
Partially 
and 
fully 
fluorinated
hydrocarbons, HFCs and PFCs, are
not controlled by the Montreal
Protocol because they do not
contribute to depletion of the
stratospheric ozone layer.

Table 2-26 (Reference Manual) gives an overview of the most important
HFCs and PFCs including application area and GWP relative to CO2 (100
year integration time).
D a t a  S o u r c e s
The type of data required depends on the level of effort that is to be
expended and the accuracy required.  At a minimum, quantities of
halocarbons and SF6 imported and exported in bulk and national production
are required.  For the next level, the quantities of these materials contained
in products imported and exported are required. Data on production and
exports of chemicals in bulk should be available from chemical companies
and/or national production statistics. Information on imports of chemicals in
bulk and in products may be available from Customs and Duty records.
National environmental protection authorities may keep records of
HFCs/PFCs destroyed, if any.
G e n e r a l  M e t h o d o l o g y
In Tier 1 (a and b) methodology, potential emissions of a certain chemical
are equal to the amount of virgin chemical consumed in the country minus
the amount of chemical recovered for destruction or exported in the year
under consideration.  All chemicals consumed will eventually be emitted to
the atmosphere over time if not destroyed, and in the long term (e.g., 50 yr),
potential emissions will equal actual emissions.
In the Tier 2 methodology, actual emission estimates take into account the
time lag between consumption and emission, which may be considerable in
some application areas, e.g., closed cell foams, refrigeration and fire
extinguishing equipment.  Time lags result from the fact that a chemical is
placed in new products and then slowly leaks out over time.
Actual emissions estimates are the most accurate with respect to emissions
in individual years, provided that the necessary information is available for
their calculation.  If essential data are not available, the potential emission
calculations provide a simpler approach for reasonable emission estimates.
The following procedures described for HFCs/PFCs are applicable for SF6 as
well.

Since net consumption of a chemical equals production plus imports minus
exports, the calculation formula for the basic method (Tier 1) is as follows:
Potential Emissions = Production + Imports - Exports - Destruction
HFCS, PFCS AND SF6
HFCs are chemicals containing only
hydrogen, 
carbon, 
and 
fluorine.
PFCs are chemicals containing only
carbon and fluorine.  SF6 is a
particularly potent GHG with a 100-
year GWP of 23,900 and an
estimated lifetime of about 3,200
years.
POTENTIAL AND ACTUAL
EMISSIONS
Emissions from industrial processes
can be estimated in two ways; as
potential emissions, Tier 1 (a and b),
and as actual emissions, Tier 2.   Tier
1b is preferred to the Tier 1a
methodology.

By-product emissions during HFC/PFC production and fugitive emissions
related to production and distribution have to be calculated separately, as
described in Section 2.16.
Production refers to production of new chemical only and not the
reprocessing of recovered fluid.
There are two versions of Tier 1 (a and b) depending upon whether
HFCs/PFCs in products are taken into account.  Two versions are presented
because it is expected that there may be difficulties in many countries with
the availability of data regarding imports and exports of HFCs/PFCs in
products, at least in the short term.  The Tier 1b methodology is preferred
if the relevant data are available.
Tier 1a
In Tier 1a, only chemicals imported or exported in bulk are considered in
the calculation of potential emissions.  The following definitions apply:
Imports  =  Imported HFC/PFC in bulk
Exports  =  Exported HFC/PFC in bulk
The application of Tier 1a may lead to an under-estimation or an over-
estimation of potential emissions, depending on whether the majority of
HFC/PFC-containing products is being imported or exported.
Tier 1b
Tier 1b is an extension of Tier 1a and includes HFCs/PFCs contained in
various products which are imported and exported.  The following
definitions apply:
Imports
= 
Imported chemical in bulk + quantity of chemical
imported in HFC/PFC containing products
Exports
=
Exported chemical in bulk + quantity of chemical
exported in HFC/PFC containing products
The product types that should be considered are
- refrigeration and air conditioning units
-
foam products
-
fire extinguishers
-
solvents
-
aerosol cans
Most of these items will use mixtures of halocarbons that must be assessed
separately due to their vastly different global warming potentials.
REFRIGERATION, FIRE
EXTINGUISHERS AND SOLVENTS
Refrigeration units, fire extinguishers
and solvents will normally contain
HFC/PFC mixtures.  The fraction of
each chemical must be considered
separately.  Refrigeration units may
be refrigerators, ice machines, AC
window units, split-units, chillers, etc.
FOAM PRODUCTS
Foam products include insulating and
non-insulating foams in a variety of
products, like refrigerators,
insulation panels, pour-in-place
sprays, car seats, furniture, bedding,
packaging material, etc.

The advanced method, Tier 2, contains actual emission calculations for each
individual chemical.  This is the preferred method if input data are available. It
is recommended that routines are established to report HFC/PFC emissions
according to Tier 2.
To use this methodology one must employ a “bottom-up” approach or a
“top-down” approach. In a “bottom-up” approach, one calculates or
estimates the consumption of each individual HFC and PFC chemical based
on the number of pieces of equipment or uses at a detailed level, e.g.,
refrigerators, other stationary refrigeration/AC equipment, soft foam, hard
foam etc., to establish the volume basis for emission calculations. A
“top-down” approach estimates emissions on the basis of the consumption
distribution and emission characteristics related to various processes and
equipment, also taking current service and recovery practices into account.
Table 2-27 gives examples of current distribution of HFC/PFC use among
various application areas in certain countries.  Since HFCs and PFCs have
only recently entered the market, the relative size of each area will change
over time and will have to be updated.

iii)
Mobile air conditioners used to cool the passenger compartment of

Methods for estimating average emission rates for the above-uses sectors
are outlined below.
The quantity of refrigerant emitted during system assembly is related to the
amount charged by the following empirical formula:
EQUATION 1
E assembly, t = E charged, t • (k/100)
where:
Eassembly,t
=
emissions during system manufacture/assembly in year
t
Echarged,t
=
amount of refrigerant charged into new systems in
year t
k
=
assembly losses in per cent of the amount charged
The amount charged (Echarged,t) should include all systems which are charged
in the country, including those which are made for export.  Systems that are
imported precharged should not be considered.
Annual leakage from the stock, including venting during service, is given by :
EQUATION 2

in 
many

be used in refrigeration applications,
particularly as components of blends.
These include HFC-23, HFC-32,
HFC-125, HFC-143a, and HFC-152a.

In calculating the refrigerant “bank” (Estock,t) all systems in operation in the
country (home-made and imported) have to be considered.
The amount of refrigerant released from scrapped systems depends upon the
amount of refrigerant left at the time of disposal, and the portion recovered.
To estimate emissions at system disposal, the following calculation formula is
applicable:
EQUATION 3
E disposal, t = Ei charge, (t - n) • (y/100) • (100 - z )/100
or
 E disposal, t = E i charge, (t - n) • Q
where:
Edisposal,t
=
amount of HFC/PFC emitted at system disposal in
year t
Eicharge; (t-n)
=
amount of HFC/PFC initially charged into new
systems installed in year (t-n)
n
=
average equipment lifetime, years
y
=
amount of HFC/PFC in systems at time of disposal in
per cent of initial charge, per cent
z
=
amount of HFC/PFC recovered in per cent of actual
charge (“recovery efficiency”), per cent
Q
=
amount of HFC/PFC emitted at system disposal in
per cent of the quantity of chemical originally
charged into the system, per cent (Q = y(100-z)/100)
In estimating the amount of refrigerant initially charged into the systems
(Ei, charged (t-n)), both systems charged in the country (for home market) and
systems imported precharged should be taken into account.  The first charge
into systems made for export should not be considered.  For example, if
calculating emissions for 1995 with equipment that has a 15-year lifetime,
then information on quantity of HFC/PFC charged in 1980 (1995-15) is
required.  Total emissions in year t will then be found as the sum of
emissions at assembly, during operational life and at disposal:
EQUATION 4
E total, t = E assembly, t + E operation, t + E disposal, t

Typical refrigerant charges in mobile air conditioners are 1.2 kg/unit for cars
and 1.5 kg/unit for trucks.  MACs in newer cars may have a lower charge,
e.g., 800 g which is typical for Japanese passenger cars.
B)
Foam Blowing
i)
Open Cell Foam
For open cell foams, HFC and PFC emissions occur at the time of
manufacture and are equal to 100 per cent of the total quantity of chemical
used as the blowing agent.  As a result total HFC or PFC emissions in year t
for open cell foam can be calculated as follows:
Emissions of HFCs or PFCs in year t = 100% of the quantity of HFCs or
PFCs sold for blowing open cell foam in year t
ii)
Closed Cell Foam
For closed cell foams, only about 10 per cent of the blowing agent is
released during the blowing of the foam, while the remaining chemical is
contained in the insulation.  This quantity remaining in the foam is slowly
released over the 20 to 25 year lifetime of the foam.  HFC or PFC emissions
from insulating foam in year t are therefore calculated as follows:

2.53
Emissions of HFCs or PFCs in year t
=
10 per cent of the total quantity of HFC or PFC used in manufacturing
new insulating foam in year t
+
4.5 per cent of the quantity of original HFC or PFC charge blown into
the insulated foam manufactured between year t and year t-20
The total quantity of HFC or PFC contained in the existing stock of
insulating foam can be calculated as the product of the total quantity of
insulating foam in use in year t and the average charge of chemical contained
in each tonne of such installed insulating foam.
If action is taken to control emissions from foam blowing by recycling or
leakage control then an alternative formula may be applicable. See Reference
Manual, Section 2.17.4.3.
C)
Fire Extinguishers
Total halon emissions can be estimated as 60 per cent of total halon 1211
contained in new portable halon fire extinguishers installed each year, and as
35 per cent of total Halon 1301 contained in new total flooding equipment
installed each year.  The remaining amounts of chemical, 40 per cent for
portable fire extinguishers and 65 per cent for total flooding equipment
respectively, adds to the bank of fire extinguishing chemicals.  As halons are
replaced, emissions of HFCs and PFCs may be calculated:
Emissions of HFCs or PFCs in year t
=
60 per cent of the total quantity of HFC or PFC used in new portable
halocarbon fire extinguishing equipment installed in year t
Similarly, emissions estimates in year t for total flooding equipment can be
calculated as:
Emissions of HFCs or PFCs in year t
=
35 per cent of the total quantity of HFC or PFC used new fixed
halocarbon fire extinguishing equipment installed in year t
D)
Aerosols
Emissions from aerosols are modelled by the following equation :
Emissions of HFCs in year t
=
50% of the quantity of HFCs contained in aerosols sold in year t
+
50% of the quantity of HFC contained in aerosols sold in year t-1
HFC AND PFC USE IN FIRE
EXTINGUISHERS
HFCs 
and 
PFCs 
are 
potential
replacements for Halon 1211 in
portable fire extinguishers and Halon
1301 in total flooding fixed fire
extinguishing systems.  Potential
substitutes include HFC-23, HFC-
125, HFC-227ea, PFC-410, and  PFC-
614.
SF6  USE IN FIRE EXTINGUISHERS
Some of the new substitutes for
halon in fire extinguishing equipment
contain sulphur hexafluoride, SF6,
probably in blends with HFC.  If the
products contain SF6, it is emitted to
the atmosphere in the same manner
as HFC or PFC.  The equations for
the estimation of HFC and PFC
emissions from fire extinguishing
equipment are therefore also valid
for SF6, since they have to be
adjusted for the proportion of the
SF6 in the original blend.  Emissions
of SF6 are to be calculated according
to the proportion of this chemical in
the blend.

This calculation accounts for the six-month lag from purchase to use.
E)
Solvents
Chemicals used as cleaning agents are emitted during, or shortly after, use
and are typically 100 per cent of total use.  This methodology assumes that
solvents, on average, are used six months after they are sold.
Emissions of HFCs or PFCs in year t
=
50% of the quantity of HFCs or PFC
sold for use in solvent applications in year t
+
50% of the quantity of HFCs
sold for use in solvent applications in year t-1
F)
Other Applications
For other applications, it is assumed that all HFCs and PFC are released
within 6 months after production.  Emissions in the year t can be calculated
as follows:
Emissions of HFCs or PFCs in year t
=
50% of the quantity of HFCs/PFCs sold for other applications in year t
+
 50% of the quantity of HFCs/PFCs sold in year t-1
Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6) Emissions
SF6 is used as an insulation medium in high tension electrical equipment
including gas insulated switchgear (GIS) and circuit breakers.
The use of SF6 in production of aluminium and magnesium is covered under
Reference Manual, Section 2.13.8.
Total annual emissions of SF6 used in GIS applications and circuit breakers
can be assumed to be approximately 1 per cent of the total quantity of SF6
contained in equipment.  In addition, if it is assumed that GIS has a lifetime of
30 years, then approximately 70 per cent of the SF6 will remain in the
equipment upon retirement and will then be released upon disposal of the
equipment.  Total emissions from GIS applications can therefore be
estimated as:
HFC AND PFC USE AS SOLVENTS
HFCs and PFCs may be used as
replacements for CFC-113 in metal
cleaning, electronics, and precision
cleaning 
applications 
and 
as
replacements for aerosol cleaning.
The compounds that may be used
include HFC-43-10, PFC-614, PFC-
512, PFC-612, PFC-716, and PFC-
819.
OTHER HFC AND PFC USE
Other applications in which HFCs
and PFCs may replace CFC and
HCFC include sterilisation
equipment, tobacco expansion
applications, and as solvents in the
manufacture of adhesives, coatings
and inks. The specific compounds
include HFC-125, HFC-134a, and
HFC-227 ea.
