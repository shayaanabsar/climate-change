4 FUGITIVE EMISSIONS 
Users are expected to go to Mapping Tables in Annex 2, before reading this chapter. This is required to correctly 
understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the corresponding chapter 
in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
Intentional or unintentional release of greenhouse gases may occur during the extraction, processing, 
transformation and delivery of fossil fuels to the point of final use. These are known as fugitive emissions. Certain 
fugitive emissions from biomass are included here as well, such as fugitives of biogas from natural gas systems 
(e.g. distribution pipelines), and fugitives during fuel transformation for charcoal. 
4.1 
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM MINING, 
PROCESSING, STORAGE AND 
TRANSPORTATION OF COAL 
4.1.1 
Overview and description of sources 
Fugitive emissions associated with coal can be considered in terms of the following broad categories.0F1 
4.1.1.1 COAL MINING AND HANDLING  
The geological processes of coal formation also produce methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) may also be 
present in some coal seams. These are known collectively as seam gas, and remain trapped in the coal seam until 
the coal is exposed and broken during mining. CH4 is the major greenhouse gas emitted from coal mining and 
handling. 
The major stages for the emission of greenhouse gases for both underground and surface coal mines are: 
• Mining emissions – These emissions result from the liberation of stored gas during the breakage of coal, and 
the surrounding strata, during mining operations. 
• Post-mining emissions – Not all gas is released from coal during the process of coal breakage during mining. 
Emissions, during subsequent handling, processing and transportation of coal are termed post-mining 
emissions. Therefore coal normally continues to emit gas even after it has been mined, although more slowly 
than during the coal breakage stage. 
• Low temperature oxidation - These emissions arise because once coal is exposed to oxygen in air, the coal 
oxidizes to produce CO2. However, the rate of formation of CO2 by this process is low. 
• Uncontrolled combustion – On occasions, when the heat produced by low temperature oxidation is trapped, 
the temperature rises and an active fire may result. This is commonly known as uncontrolled combustion and 
is the most extreme manifestation of oxidation. Uncontrolled combustion is characterised by rapid reactions, 
sometimes visible flames and rapid CO2 formation, and may be natural or anthropogenic. It is noted that 
uncontrolled combustion only due to coal exploitation activities is considered here. 
• Exploration emissions – These emissions result from boreholes drilled through carbonaceous strata for the 
purposes of coal exploration. This is distinct from gas drainage boreholes which form part of a degasification 
system. 
After mining has ceased left over coals in, abandoned coal mines may also continue to emit methane. 
A brief description of some of the major processes that need to be accounted for in estimating emissions for the 
different types of coal mines follows: 
UNDERGROUND MINES 
Active Underground Coal Mines 
The following potential source categories for fugitive emissions for active underground coal mines are considered 
in this document: 
 
1  Methods for determining emissions from peat extraction are described in Volume 4 AFOLU Chapter 7 ‘Wetlands’. 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.11 
• Seam gas emissions vented to the atmosphere from coal mine ventilation air and degasification systems; 
• Post-mining emissions; 
• Low temperature oxidation; 
• Uncontrolled combustion. 
Coal mine ventilation air and degasification systems arise as follows: 
Coal Mine Ventilation Air 
Underground coal mines are normally ventilated by flushing air from the surface, through the underground tunnels 
in order to maintain a safe atmosphere. Ventilation air picks up the CH4 and CO2 released from the coal formations 
and transports these to the surface where they are emitted to atmosphere. The concentration of CH4 in the 
ventilation air is normally low, but the volume flow rate of ventilation air is normally large and therefore the 
methane emissions from this source can be very significant. 
Coal Mine Degasification Systems 
Degasification systems comprise wells drilled before, during, and after mining to drain gas (mainly CH4) from the 
coal seams that release gas into the mine workings. During active mining the major purpose of degasification is to 
maintain a safe working atmosphere for the coal miners, although the recovered gas may also be utilised as an 
energy source.  Degasification systems can also be used at abandoned underground coal mines to recover methane. 
The amount of methane recovered from coal mine degasification systems can be very significant and is accounted 
for, depending on its final use, as described in Section 4.1.3.2 of this chapter. 
Abandoned Underground Mines 
After closure, coal mines that were significant CH4 emitters during mining operations continue to emit methane 
unless there is flooding that cuts off the emissions. Even if the mines have been sealed, methane may still be 
emitted to the atmosphere as a result of gas migrating through natural or manmade conduits such as old portals, 
vent pipes, or cracks and fissures in the overlying strata. Emissions quickly decline until they reach a near-steady 
rate that may persist for an extended period of time. 
Abandoned mines may flood as a result of intrusion of groundwater or surface water into the mine void. These 
mines typically continue to emit gas for a few years before the mine becomes completely flooded and the water 
prevents further methane release to the atmosphere. Emissions from completely flooded abandoned mines can be 
treated as negligible. Mines that remain partially flooded can continue to produce methane emissions over a long 
period of time, as with mines that do not flood. 
A further potential source of emissions occurs when some of the coal from abandoned mines ignites through the 
mechanism of uncontrolled combustion.  However, there are currently no methodologies for estimating potential 
emissions from uncontrolled combustion at abandoned underground mines. 
SURFACE COAL MINES 
Active Surface Mines 
The potential source categories for surface mining considered in this chapter are: 
• Methane and CO2 emitted during mining from breakage of coal and associated strata and leakage from the pit 
floor and highwall 
• Post-mining emissions 
• Low temperature oxidation 
• Uncontrolled combustion in waste dumps 
Emissions from surface coal mining occur because the mined and surrounding seams may also contain CH4 and 
CO2. Although the gas contents are generally less than for deeper underground coal seams, the emission of seam 
gas from surface mines needs to be taken into account, particularly for countries where this mining method is 
widely practised. In addition to seam gas emissions, the waste coal that is dumped into overburden or reject dumps 
may generate CO2, either by low temperature oxidation or by uncontrolled combustion. 
Abandoned Surface Mines 
After closure, abandoned or decommissioned surface mines may continue to emit methane as the gas leaks from 
the coal seams that were broken or damaged during mining. There are at present no methods for estimating 
emissions from this source.

COAL EXPLORATION 
This source category includes emissions arising from boreholes drilled for coal mining exploration purposes. It 
does not include coal gas drainage wells used to collect gas prior to, or as a part of coal mining activities. Fugitive 
emissions from coal seam gas drainage wells are included in Underground and Surface Mining Activities. Gas 
drainage or production boreholes that consist of a coal seam gas exploration aspect exclusively, are not to be 
counted as coal exploration boreholes, and are instead included under 1.B.2. 
The overall coal exploration process involves drilling of vertical boreholes from the surface of the Earth to detect 
the presence of coal seams, their depth of occurrence, thickness and other geological structures, resource and 
chemical characteristics such as ash, moisture, volatile matter (VM) and fixed carbon (FC). A small fraction of the 
methane gas retained by the coal seams may be released during borehole drilling and escape to the atmosphere. 
Emissions will occur only if the borehole drilling penetrates some gas bearing strata such as coal and carbonaceous 
shale. 
Boreholes and wells associated with coal gas drainage and coal bed methane/natural gas exploration are focused 
on determining gas flow, and gas bearing strata are often stimulated to increase gas flow. Coal exploration 
boreholes are focused on obtaining core samples for resource estimation and investigation of various chemical and 
geo-mechanical parameters essential for designing the resource recovery, and therefore the coal fracture systems 
are not artificially stimulated. Thus, the gas flow from coal exploration boreholes and coal bed methane/natural 
gas boreholes are not comparable.

Methodological issues 
The following sections focus on methane emissions, as this gas is the most important fugitive emission for coal 
mining. Methods for estimating carbon dioxide emissions from underground and surface mining are also provided. 
Carbon dioxide emissions from other coal mining sources such as post-mining and abandoned mines should also 
be included in the inventory where data are available. 
UNDERGROUND MINING 
Fugitive emissions from underground mining arise from both ventilation and degasification systems. These 
emissions are normally emitted at a small number of centralised locations and can be considered as point sources. 
They are amenable to standard measurement methods. 
SURFACE MINING 
For surface mining the emissions of greenhouse gases are generally dispersed over sections of the mine and are 
best considered area sources. These emissions may be the result of seam gases emitted through the processes of 
breakage of the coal and overburden, low temperature oxidation of waste coal or low quality coal in dumps, and 
uncontrolled combustion. Measurement methods for low temperature oxidation and uncontrolled combustion are 
still being developed and therefore estimation methods are not included in this chapter. 
ABANDONED MINES 
Abandoned underground mines present difficulties in estimating emissions, although a methodology for 
abandoned underground mines is included in this chapter. Methodologies do not yet exist for abandoned or 
decommissioned surface mines, and therefore they are not included in this chapter. 
EXPLORATION 
Tier 1 default emission factors could not be developed in the 2019 Refinement process due to a lack of scientific 
information. A methodology and emission factors are not presented here for coal exploration.  If coal exploration 
activities are present and expected to result in significant emissions, a compiler should make appropriate effort to 
estimate emissions for this source under 1.B.1a.iii. 
It may be necessary to generate new data since emission factors, activity data or other estimation parameters do 
not exist, or cannot be estimated from existing sources. In most cases generating new source data will be limited 
by the resources available and prioritisation will be needed, taking account of the results of key category analysis 
set out in Volume 1, Chapter 4, Methodological Choice and Identification of Key Categories. In these cases, it is 
good practice to make an initial estimate of the source and/or sink emissions or removals and compare this to the 
magnitude of key categories in order to assess and prioritize the effort required. Such initial estimates can be very 
rough and may be based on expert judgement as they are intended to guide resource use. If a new source or sink 
is estimated to be on a scale similar to the key categories then it is good practice to use Tier 2 or 3 methods, and 
data collection should be planned accordingly. Generation of new data is best undertaken by those with appropriate 
expertise (e.g., measurements carried out by competent organisations using appropriately calibrated equipment or 
surveys and censuses by any national statistical authority). These activities are often resource intensive and are 
most appropriately considered when the category is key and there are no other options. Compilers may refer to 
Volume 1, Chapter 2, Approaches to Data Collection. 
The inventory compilers, while estimating these emissions for tier 2/3 level, could collect relevant activity data 
such as the number of coal exploration boreholes drilled each year in different geographies. The compiler could

consult with national statistic or mining agencies and industry sources for the relevant data. For a tier 3 approach, 
each borehole could be measured.  For a tier 2 approach, appropriate emission factors could be developed using 
emissions data collected from a representative number of coal exploration boreholes.   The activity data and 
emission factors could then be multiplied separately for each coal borehole and aggregated to the national level so 
as to arrive at the national fugitive emission estimation from coal exploration, using equation 4.1.0 below for 
example.

METHANE RECOVERY AND UTILISATION 
Methane recovered from drainage, ventilation air, or abandoned mines may be mitigated in two ways: (1) direct 
utilization as a natural gas resource or (2) by flaring to produce CO2, which has a lower global warming potential 
than methane. 
TIERS 
Use of appropriate tiers to develop emissions estimates for coal mining in accordance with good practice depends 
on the quality of data available. For instance, if limited data are available and the category is not key, then Tier 1 
is good practice. The Tier 1 approach requires that countries choose from a global average range of emission 
factors and use country-specific activity data to calculate total emissions. Tier 1 is associated with the highest level 
of uncertainty. The Tier 2 approach uses country- or basin-specific emission factors that represent the average 
values for the coals being mined. These values are normally developed by each country, where appropriate. The 
Tier 3 approach uses direct measurements on a mine-specific basis and, properly applied, has the lowest level of 
uncertainty. 
4.1.3 
Underground coal mines 
The general form of the equation for estimating emissions for Tier 1 and 2 approaches, based on coal production 
activity data from underground coal mining and post-mining emissions is given by Equation 4.1.1 below. Methods 
to estimate emissions from abandoned underground mines are described in detail in Section 4.1.5. 
Equation 4.1.1 represents emissions before adjustment for any utilisation or flaring of recovered gas:

The definition of the Emission Factor used in this equation depends on the activity data used. For Tier 1 and Tier 
2, the Emission Factor for underground, surface and post-mining emissions has units of m3 tonne-1, the same units 
as in situ gas content. This is because these Emission Factors are used with activity data on raw coal production 
which has mass units (i.e. tonnes). However, the Emission Factor and the in situ gas content are not the same and 
should not be confused. The Emission Factor is always larger than the in situ gas content, because the gas released 
during mining draws from a larger volume of coal and adjacent gas-bearing strata than simply the volume of coal 
produced. For abandoned underground mines, the Emission Factor has different units, because of the different 
methodologies employed, see Section 4.1.5 for greater detail. 
The equation to be used along with Equation 4.1.1 in order to adjust for methane utilisation and flaring for Tier 1 
and Tier 2 approaches is shown in Equation 4.1.2.

Emissions of CH4 from underground mines in Equations 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 include abandoned mines (see Section 
4.1.5) and both go into the total for 1.B.1.a.i (Underground mines). Theoretically, Equations 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 should 
also include CO2 emissions from post-mining activities and abandoned mines. However, considering that Section 
4.1.3.2 and 4.1.5 below provides no methods or emission factors for neither of those two CO2 emission sources, 
therefore the general equations for CO2 here are simply the emissions from underground mining operations.  
Equation 4.1.2 is used for Tiers 1 and 2 because they use Emission Factors to account for emissions from coal 
mines on a national or coal-basin level. The emission factors already include all the methane likely to be released 
from mining activities. Thus, any methane recovery and utilization must be explicitly accounted for by the 
subtraction term in Equation 4.1.2.  
Similarly, where gas from coal seams is recovered for fuel combustion, the amount of CO2 contained in the 
recovered gas, which could be determined in a similar way as how the volume of methane recovery and utilization 
in Equation 4.1.2 is obtained (for example, being estimated based on national total amount of gas recovered and 
average CO2/CH4 concentration representative of national circumstances, or  coal basin-level or even mine-
specific calculations which take into account the gas drained and recovered from individual mines),  should also 
be accounted for by the subtraction term in Equation 4.1.2. That CO2 will be eventually accounted for in the 
categories where the gas from coal seam are consumed under Chapter 2 Stationary Combustion. 
If the gas recovered from coal seams is flared or catalytically oxidised with no useful energy, then the amount of 
CO2 contained in that recovered gas is accounted as fugitive emissions under 1 B 1 a i 4, using Equation 4.1.5. 
Tier 3 methods involve mine-specific calculations which take into account the methane drained and recovered 
from individual mines rather than emission factors, and therefore Equation 4.1.2 is not appropriate for Tier 3 
methods. 
4.1.3.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
UNDERGROUND MINING 
Figures 4.1.1 and 4.1.1a shows the methane and carbon dioxide decision trees for underground coal mining 
activities. For countries with underground mining, and where mine-specific measurement data are available it is 
good practice to use a Tier 3 method. Mine-specific CH4 and CO2 data, based on ventilation air measurements and 
degasification system measurements, reflect actual emissions on a mine-by-mine basis, and therefore produce a 
more accurate estimate than using Emission Factors. 
Hybrid Tier 3 - Tier 2 approaches are appropriate in situations when mine-specific measurement data are available 
only for a subset of underground mines. For example, if only mines that are considered gassy report data, emissions 
from the remaining mines can be calculated with Tier 2 emission factors.  The definition of what constitutes a 
gassy mine will be determined by each country. For instance, in the United States, gassy mines refers to coal mines 
with average annual ventilation emissions exceeding the range of 2 800 to 14 000 cubic meters per day.  Emission 
factors can be based on specific emission rates derived from Tier 3 data if the mines are operating within the same 
basin as the Tier 3 mines, or on the basis of mine-specific properties, such as the average depth of the coal mines. 
When no mine-by-mine data are available, but country- or basin-specific data are, it is good practice to employ 
the Tier 2 method. 
Where no data (or very limited data) are available, it is good practice to use a Tier 1 approach, provided 
underground coal mining is not a key sub source category. If it is, then it is good practice to obtain emissions data 
to increase the accuracy of these emissions estimates (see Figures 4.1.1 and 4.1.1a). A reliable relationship between 
CH4 and CO2 emissions levels from underground coal mining is not able to be established as of now for the 
purposes of emission estimation. Therefore emission methods based on correlation between CH4 and CO2 are not 
provided.

4.16 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
POST-MINING 
Direct measurement (Tier 3) of all post-mining emissions is not feasible, so an emission factor approach must be 
used. The Tier 2 and Tier 1 methods described below represent good practice for this source, given the difficulty 
of obtaining better data. 
LOW TEMPERATURE OXIDATION 
Oxidation of coal when it is exposed to the atmosphere by coal mining releases CO2. Low temperature oxidation 
of coal is one among other sources of CO2 during mining activity. Tier 1 approach uses emission factors that cover 
all fugitive sources of CO2 including low temperature oxidation. 
ABANDONED UNDERGROUND MINES 
Fugitive methane emissions from abandoned underground mines should be reported in Underground Mines in 
IPCC Category 1.B.1.a.i.3, using the methodology presented in Section 4.1.5.

This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67 ● 10-6 Gg m-3. 
Countries using the Tier 1 approach should consider country-specific variables such as the depth of major coal 
seams to determine the emission factor to be used. As gas content of coal usually increases with depth, the low 
end of the range should be chosen for average mining depths of <200 m, and for depths of > 400 m the high value 
is appropriate. For intermediate depths, average values can be used. 
For countries using a Tier 2 approach, basin-specific emission factors may be obtained from sample ventilation air 
data or from a quantitative relationship that accounts for the gas content of the coal seam and the surrounding strata 
affected by the mining process, along with raw coal production. For a typical longwall operation, the amount of 
gas released comes from the coal being extracted and from any other gas-bearing strata that are located within 150 
m above and 50 m below the mined seam (Good Practice Guidance, 2000).

Countries should use the Average CO2 Emission Factor unless there is country-specific evidence to support use of 
an alternative factor within the low/high range. Countries may consider country-specific circumstances such as 
geological location/basis/depth to determine the emission factor to be used. Where CO2 outbursts have been 
frequently observed as a safety concern in mining, then a country should consider the use of the high end CO2 
emission factor. 
For countries using a Tier 2 approach, basin-specific emission factors may be obtained from analysis of ventilation 
air data. When assessing CO2 gas volumes in mine ventilation systems, care needs to be taken to exclude CO2 from 
non-fugitive sources such as; 
• ambient carbon dioxide present in the air that was drawn into the mine ventilation intake - to take into account 
the atmospheric CO2 constant of the air drawn into the intake of the ventilation system; 
• fuel combustion CO2 emissions arising from the use of machinery, while the machinery is in the underground 
mine.

Tier 2 methods to estimate post-mining emissions take into account the in situ gas content of the coal. 
Measurements on coal as it emerges on a conveyor from an underground mine without degasification prior to 
mining indicate that 25-40 percent of the in situ gas remains in the coal (Williams and Saghafi, 1993). For mines 
that practice pre-drainage, the amount of gas in coal will be less than the in situ value by some unknown amount. 
For mines with no pre-drainage, but with knowledge of the in situ gas content, the post-mining emission factor 
can be set at 30 percent of the in situ gas content. For mines with pre-drainage, an emission factor of 10 percent of 
the in situ gas content is suggested. 
Tier 3 methods are not regarded as feasible for post-mining operations. 
EMISSIONS FROM DRAINED METHANE 
Methane drained from working (or abandoned) underground (or surface) coal mines can be vented directly to the 
atmosphere, recovered and utilised, or converted to CO2 through combustion (flaring or catalytic oxidation) 
without any utilisation. The manner of accounting for drained methane varies, depending on the final use of the 
methane. 
In general: 
• Tier 1 represents an aggregate emissions estimate using emission factors. In general, it is not expected that 
emissions associated with drained methane would be applicable for Tier 1. Presumably, if methane were being 
drained, there would be better data to enable use of Tier 2 or even Tier 3 methods to make emissions estimates. 
However, Tier 1 has been included in the discussion below, in case Tier 1 methods are being used to estimate 
national emissions where there are methane drainage operations. 
• When methane is drained from coal seams as part of coal mining and subsequently flared or used as a fuel, it 
is good practice to subtract this amount from the total estimate of methane emissions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 
(Equation 4.1.2). Data on the amount of methane that is flared or otherwise utilised should be obtained from 
mine operators with the same frequency of measurement as pertains to underground mine emissions generally. 
• For Tiers 1 and 2, if methane is drained and vented to the atmosphere rather than utilized, it should not be re-
counted as it already forms part of the emissions estimates for these approaches. 
• For Tier 3, methane recovered from degasification systems and vented to the atmosphere prior to mining should 
be added to the amount of methane released through ventilation systems so that the total estimate is complete. 
In some cases, because degasification system data are considered confidential, it may be necessary to estimate 
degasification system collection efficiency, and then subtract known reductions to arrive at the net 
degasification system emissions.

• All methane emissions associated with coal seam degasification related to coal mining activities should be 
accounted for in the inventory year in which the emissions and recovery operations occur. Thus, the total 
emissions from all ventilation shafts and from all degasification operations that emit methane to the atmosphere 
are reported for each year, regardless of when the coal seam is mined through, as long as the emissions are 
associated with mining activities.  
• When coal bed methane is extracted from coal seams and is delivered into a natural gas system, then the fugitive 
emissions associated with the exploration, production, processing, transmission and storage are dealt with in 
the oil and natural gas source category (Section 4.2). Tier 1 fugitive emission factors for coal bed methane 
production are provided under 1B 2 b iii 2 Production and Gathering in Table 4.2.10. 
When recovered methane is utilized as an energy source: 
• Any emissions resulting from use of recovered coal mine methane as an energy source should be accounted 
for based on its final end-use, for example in the Energy Volume, Chapter 2, ‘Stationary Combustion’ when 
used for stationary energy production. 
• Where recovered methane from coal seams is fed into a natural gas system and used as natural gas, the fugitive 
emissions occurring as part of those natural gas systems are dealt with in the oil and natural gas source category 
(Section 4.2). 
When recovered methane is flared: 
• When the methane is simply combusted with no useful energy, as in flaring or catalytic oxidation to CO2, the 
corresponding CO2 production should be added to the total greenhouse gas emissions (expressed as CO2 
equivalents) from coal mining activities. Such emissions should be accounted for as shown by Equation 4.1.5, 
below. Amounts of nitrous oxide and non-methane volatile organic compounds emitted during flaring will be 
small relative to the overall fugitive emissions and need not be estimated.

4.1.3.6 UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Emission Factors for Tiers 1 and 2 
The major sources of uncertainty for a Tier 1 approach arise from two sources. These are: 
• The applicability of global emission factors to individual countries; 
• Inherent uncertainties in the emission factors themselves. 
The uncertainty due to the first point above is difficult to quantify, but could be significant. The inherent 
uncertainty in the emission factor is also difficult to quantify because of natural variability within the same coal 
region is known to occur. 
For a Tier 2 approach, the same broad comments apply, although basin-specific data will reduce the inherent 
uncertainty in the Emission Factor compared with a Tier 1 approach. With regard to the inherent variability in the 
Emission Factor, ‘Expert Judgement’ in the Good Practice Guidance (2000) suggested that this was likely to be 
at least ±50 percent. 
Table 4.1.2 shows the Tier 1 and Tier 2 uncertainties associated with emissions from underground coal mining. 
The uncertainties for these Tiers are based on expert judgement.

Tier 3 
Methane emissions from underground mines have a significant natural variability due to variations in the rate of 
mining and drainage of gas. For instance, the gas liberated by longwall mining can vary by a factor of up to two 
during the life of a longwall panel. Frequent measurements of underground mine emissions can account for such 
variability and also reduce the intrinsic errors in the measurement techniques. As emissions vary over the course 
of a year due to variations in coal production rate and associated drainage, good practice is to collect measurement 
data as frequently as practical, preferably biweekly or monthly to smooth out variations. Daily measurements 
would ensure a higher quality estimate. Continuous monitoring of emissions represents the highest stage of 
emission monitoring, and is implemented in some modern longwall mines. 
Spot measurements of methane concentration in ventilation air are probably accurate to ±20 percent depending on 
the equipment used. Time series data or repeat measurements will significantly reduce the uncertainty of annual 
emissions to ±5 percent for continuous monitoring, and 10-15 percent for monitoring conducted every two weeks. 
Ventilation airflows are usually fairly accurately known (±2 percent). When combining the inaccuracies in 
emissions concentration measurements with the imprecision due to measurement and calculation of instantaneous 
measurements, overall emissions for an individual mine may be under-represented by as much as 10 percent or 
over-represented by as much as 30 percent (Mutmansky and Wang, 2000). 
Spot measurement of methane concentration in drained gas (from degasification systems) is likely to be accurate 
to ±2 percent because of its higher concentration. Measurements should be made with a frequency comparable to 
those for ventilation air to obtain representative sampling. Measured degasification flow rates are probably known 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.23 
to be ±5 percent. Degasification flow rates that are estimated based on gas sales are also likely to have an 
uncertainty of at least ±5 percent due to the tolerances in pipeline gas quality. 
For a single longwall operation, with continuous or daily emission measurements, the accuracy of monthly or 
annual average emissions data is probably ±5 percent. The accuracy of spot measurements performed every two 
weeks is ±10 percent, at 3-monthly intervals: ±30 percent. Aggregating emissions from mines based on the less 
frequent type of measurement procedures will reduce the uncertainty caused by fluctuations in gas production. 
However, as fugitive emissions are often dominated by contributions from only a small number of mines, it is 
difficult to estimate the extent of this improvement. 
The uncertainty estimates for underground mines are shown in Table 4.1.3.

ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
Coal production: Country-specific tonnages are likely to be known to 1-2 percent, but if raw coal data are not 
available, then the uncertainty will increase to about ±5 percent, when converting from saleable coal production 
data. The data are also influenced by moisture content, which is usually present at levels between 5-10 percent, 
and may not be determined with great accuracy. 
Apart from measurement uncertainty, there can be further uncertainties introduced by the nature of the statistical 
databases that are not considered here. In countries with a mix of regulated and unregulated mines, activity data 
may have an uncertainty of ±10 percent

4.1.4.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
It is not yet feasible to collect mine-specific Tier 3 measurement data for surface mines. The alternative is to collect 
data on surface mine coal production and use emission factors. For countries with significant coal production and 
multiple coal basins, disaggregation of data and emission factors to the coal basin level will improve accuracy. 
Given the uncertainty of production-based emission factors, choosing emission factors from the range specified 
within these guidelines can provide reasonable estimates for a Tier 1 approach. 
As with underground mining, direct measurement of post-mining emissions is infeasible so an emission factor 
approach is recommended. Tier 2 and Tier 1 methods should be reasonable for this source, given the difficulty of 
obtaining better data. A reliable relationship between CH4 and CO2 emissions levels from surface coal mining is 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
 
 
4.24 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
not able to be established for the purposes of emission estimation. Therefore emission methods based on correlation 
between CH4 and CO2 are not provided. 
Oxidation of coal in the atmosphere to produce CO2 is known to occur at surface mines, but emissions from this 
are not expected to be significant, especially taking into account the effects of rehabilitation of the waste dumps. 
Rehabilitation practices, which involve covering the dumps with topsoil and re-vegetation, act to reduce oxygen 
fluxes into the dump and hence reduce the rate of CO2 production. While no default method is provided for 
estimating Post-mining emissions of CO2, countries may choose to provide their own country-specific emission 
estimate. 
Uncontrolled combustion in waste piles is a feature for some surface mines. However, these emissions, where they 
occur, are extremely difficult to quantify and it is infeasible to include a methodology.

and analysis of gas content within carbonaceous strata of surface mines, prior to undertaking mining activities.

Uncertainties in the emissions from surface mines are less well quantified than for underground mining. Briefly, 
the sources of the uncertainty are the same as described in Section 4.1.3.6 for underground coal mines. However, 
the variability in the emission factors for large surface mines may be expected to be greater than for underground 
coal mines, because surface mines can show significant variability across the extent of the mine as a result of local 
geological features.

4.1.5.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1: Global Average Approach – Abandoned Underground Mines 
A Tier 1 approach for determining emissions from abandoned underground mines is described below and is largely 
based on methods developed by the US Environment Protection Agency (US EPA) (Franklin et al., 2004). It 
incorporates a factor to account for the fraction of those mines that, when they were actively producing coal, were 
considered gassy. Thus, this methodology is based on the total number of coal mines abandoned, adjusted for the 
fraction considered gassy, as described below. Abandoned mines that were considered non-gassy when they were 
actively mined are presumed to have negligible emissions. In the US methodology, the term gassy mines refers to 
coal mines that, when they were active, had average annual ventilation emissions that exceeded the range of 2 800 
to 14 000 cubic meters per day (m3/d), or 0.7 to 3.4 Gg per year. 
The Tier 1 – approach for abandoned underground coal mines is as follows: 
1. Determine the approximate time (year interval) from the following time intervals when gassy coal mines were 
abandoned: 
a. 
1901 – 1925 
b. 
1926 – 1950 
c. 
1951 – 1975 
d. 
1976 – 2000 
e. 
2001 – present 
2. Multiple intervals may be used where appropriate. It is recommended that the number of gassy coal mines 
abandoned during each time interval be estimated using the smallest time intervals possible based on available 
data. Ideally, for more recent periods, time intervals will decrease (e.g., intervals of ten years prior to 1990; 
annual intervals since 1990). Information for different coal mine-clusters abandoned during different time 
periods should be considered, since multiple time periods may be combined in the Tier 1 approach. 
3. Estimate the total number of abandoned mines in each time band since 1901 remaining unflooded. If there is 
no knowledge on the extent of flooding it is good practice to assume that 100 percent of mines remain 
unflooded. For the purposes of estimating the number of abandoned mines, prospect excavations and hand cart 
mines of only a few acres in size should be disregarded. 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
 
 
4.28 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4. Determine the percentage of coal mines that would be considered gassy at the time of mine closure. Based on 
the time intervals selected above, choose an estimated percentage of gassy coal mines from the high and low 
default values listed in Table 4.1.5. Actual estimates can range anywhere from 0 to 100 percent. When choosing 
within the high and low default values listed in Table 4.1.5, a country should consider all available historical 
information that may contribute to the percentage of gassy mines, such as coal rank, gas content, and depth of 
mining. Countries with recorded instances of gassy mines (e.g., methane explosions or outbursts) should 
choose the high default values in the early part of the century. From 1926 to 1975, countries where mines were 
relatively deep and hydraulic equipment was used should choose the high default value. Countries with deep 
longwall mines or with evidence of gassiness should choose the high values for the time periods after 1975. 
The low range of the default values may be appropriate for a given time interval for specific regions, coal 
basins, or nations, based on geologic conditions or known mining practices. 
5. For the inventory year of interest (between 1990 and the present), select the appropriate emissions factor from 
Table 4.1.6. For example, for mines abandoned in the interval 1901 to 1925 and for the inventory reporting 
year 2005, the Emission Factor for these mines would have a value of 0.256 million m3 of methane per mine. 
6. Calculate for each time band the total methane emissions from Equation 4.1.10 to the inventory year of interest. 
7. Sum the emissions for each time interval to derive the total abandoned mine emissions for each inventory year.

Tier 2 – Country- or Basin-Specific Approach 
The Tier 2 approach for developing an abandoned mine methane emission inventory follows a similar approach to 
Tier 1, but it incorporates country- or basin-specific data. The methodology presented below is intended to utilize 
coal basin-specific or country-specific data wherever possible (for example, for active mine emissions prior to 
abandonment, for basin-specific parameters for emissions factors, etc.). 
In some cases, default parameters have been provided for these values but these should be used only if country-
specific or basin-specific data are not available. 
Calculate emissions for a given inventory year using Equation 4.1.11:

This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67●10-6 Gg m-3 
If individual mines are known to be completely flooded, they may be assigned an emissions value of zero. Methane 
emissions reductions due to recovery projects that utilize or flare methane at abandoned mines should be subtracted 
from the emissions estimate. For either of these cases, it is recommended that a hybrid Tier 2 – Tier 3 approach be 
used to incorporate such mine-specific information (see the discussion of methane recovery and utilization projects 
from abandoned mines, Sections 4.1.5.1 and 4.1.5.3). 
The basic steps in the Tier 2 approach for abandoned underground coal mines are as follows: 
• Determine the approximate time interval(s) when significant numbers of gassy coal mines were closed. 
Multiple intervals may be used where appropriate. It is recommended that the number of gassy coal mines 
abandoned during each time interval be estimated using the smallest time intervals possible based on available 
data. Ideally, for more recent periods, time intervals will decrease (e.g., intervals of ten years prior to 1990; 
annual intervals since 1990). 
• Estimate the total number of abandoned mines in each time interval selected remaining unflooded. If there is 
no available information on the flooded status of the abandoned mines, assume 100 percent remain unflooded. 
• Determine the number (or percentage) of coal mines that would be considered gassy at the time of mine closure.

• For each time interval, determine the average emissions rate.  If country or basin-specific data do not exist, low 
and high estimates for active mine emissions prior to abandonment can be selected from Table 4.1.8. 
• For each time interval, calculate an appropriate emissions factor using Equation 4.1.12, based on the difference 
in years between the estimated data of abandonment and the year of the emissions inventory. Note that default 
values for this emissions factor equation are provided in Table 4.1.9, but these default values should be used 
only where country- or basin-specific information are not available. 
• Calculate the emissions for each time interval using Equation 4.1.11. 
• Sum the emissions for each time interval to derive the total abandoned mine emissions for each inventory year.

Tier 3 provides a great deal of flexibility. Directly measured emissions, where available, can be used in place of 
estimates and calculations. Models may be used in conjunction with measured data to estimate time series 
emissions. Each country may generate their own decline curves or other characterizations based on measurements, 
known basin-specific coal properties, and/or hydrological models. Equation 4.1.13 describes one possible, 
approach.

The basic steps in the Tier 3 methodology involve the following: 
• Determine a database of mine closures with relevant geological and hydrological information and the 
approximate abandonment dates (when all active mine ventilation ceased) consistently for all mines in the 
country’s inventory. 
• Estimate emissions based on measured emissions and/or an emissions model. This may be based on the average 
emission rate at time of mine closure, determined by the last measured emission rate (or preferably, an average 
of several measurements taken the year prior to abandonment), or estimated methane reserves susceptible to 
release. 
• If actual measurements have not been taken at a given mine, emissions may be calculated using an appropriate 
decline curve or modelling approach for openly vented mines, sealed mines, or flooded mines. Use the selected 
decline equation or modelling approach for the mine and the number of years between abandonment and the 
inventory year to calculate emissions or an appropriate emission factor for each mine. 
• Sum abandoned mine emissions to develop an annual inventory.

Completeness for coal mining 
Several sources have been identified with potential emissions, but are not included with a methodology in these 
guidelines. These are abandoned surface mines and uncontrolled combustion and burning coal deposits. 
ABANDONED SURFACE MINES 
After closure, emissions from abandoned surface mines may include the following: 
• The standing highwall 
• Leakage from the pit floor 
• Low temperature oxidation 
• Uncontrolled combustion 
At present, no comprehensive methods to quantify these emissions have been developed and therefore they have 
not been included in these guidelines. They remain subjects for further research. 
EMISSIONS FROM UNCONTROLLED COMBUSTION AND BURNING COAL 
DEPOSITS 
While emissions from this source may be significant for an individual coal mine, it is unclear as to how significant 
these emissions may be for an individual country. In some countries where such fires are widespread, the emissions

may be very significant. There are no clear methods available at present to systematically measure or precisely 
estimate the activity data, though where countries have data on amounts of coal burned, the CO2 should be 
estimated on the basis of the carbon content of the coal and reported in the relevant subcategory of 1.B.1.b. It is 
noted that uncontrolled combustion only due to coal exploration activities is considered here. Care should be taken 
to avoid double counting with fugitive CH4 and low oxidation CO2 emissions.

FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM OIL AND 
NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS 
This section is an update of Section 4.2 in Vol.2 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Fugitive emissions from oil and 
natural gas systems are accounted for in IPCC subcategory 1.B.2 of the energy sector. For reporting purposes, this 
category is subdivided as shown in Figure 4.2.0. The main distinction is made between oil and natural gas systems, 
with each being subdivided into the different parts (or segments) of the oil or gas system according to the type of 
activity1F2. Fuel gases other than natural gas, such as town gas2F3 and biogas, are often handled in natural gas systems 
(such as transmission and distribution systems), and are discussed here as well. Where coalbed methane is 
delivered into a natural gas system, any associated fugitive emissions should be reported under the appropriate 
natural gas exploration and production categories. 
The term fugitive emissions is broadly applied here to mean all greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gassystems 
except contributions from fuel combustion. Fugitive emissions include vented emissions, leak emissions, and 
flaring emissions. Oil and natural gas systems comprise all infrastructure required to produce, collect, process or 
refine and deliver natural gas and petroleum products to market, and includes abandoned oil and gas wells. The 
system begins during the exploration process, which includes all fugitive emissions associated with activities such 
as prospecting and/or exploratory drilling, well testing, field development and well development (construction to 
completion, fracture stimulation), and ends at the consumer (including fugitive emissions between gas meters and 
appliances, but not from appliance start-stop losses or appliance combustion). Emissions excluded from this 
category are as follows: 
• Fuel combustion for the production of useful heat or energy by stationary or mobile sources (see Chapters 2 
and 3 of the Energy Volume). 
• Fugitive emissions from carbon capture and storage projects, the transport and disposal of acid gas from oil 
and gas facilities by injection into secure underground formations, or the transport, injection and sequestering 
of CO2 as part of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), enhanced gas recovery (EGR) or enhanced coal bed methane 
(ECBM) projects (see Chapter 5 of the Energy Volume on carbon dioxide capture and storage systems). Note 
that fugitive emissions from the oil and gas production portions of EOR, EGR and ECBM projects are part of 
Category 1.B.2. 
• Fugitive emissions that occur at industrial facilities other than oil and gas facilities (see the Industrial Processes 
and Product Use Volume). 
• Fugitive emissions from waste disposal activities that occur outside the oil and gas industry (see the Waste 
Volume). 
• Where a coal formation is degassed for coal exploration or coal mining and handling, the associated emissions 
should be allocated to the coal sector under the appropriate section of IPCC category 1.B.1. 
When determining fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems, it may be necessary to apply greater 
disaggregation than is shown in Figure 4.2.0 to better account for local factors affecting the amount of emissions 
(i.e., reservoir conditions, processing/treatment requirements, design and operating practices, age of the industry, 
market access, regulatory requirements and the level of regulatory enforcement), and to account for changes in 
activity levels in progressing through the different parts of the system. The percentage contribution by each 
category in Figure 4.2.0 to total fugitive emissions by the oil and gas sector will vary according to the amount of 
oil and gas produced, consumed, imported and exported, and according to technologies and practices in place in 
different segments that may increase or decrease emissions. Some examples of the potential distribution of fugitive 
emissions by subcategory are provided in American Petroleum Institute (API) 2009.  
 
 
 
2 Definitions for oil wells versus gas wells can vary from country to country and organization to organization.  Guidance for 
making this distinction when applying tier 1 factors is available in Section 4.2.2.3 below.   
3 Town gas (also called coal gas) is a manufactured gaseous fuel produced for sale to commercial and residential consumers. 
The guidelines assume that town gas contains hydrogen (around 50%), carbon monoxide (around 10%), methane (around 
35%) and volatile hydrocarbons (around 5%) together with carbon dioxide and nitrogen (each less than 1%). It was used in 
Europe until the end of the last millennium and is still used in China (Zheng et al. 2010).

4.2.1 
Overview and description of sources 
The sources of fugitive emissions on oil and gas systems include, but are not limited to, equipment leaks, 
evaporation and flashing losses, venting, flaring and accidental releases (e.g., pipeline dig-ins, well blow-outs and 
spills). Venting and flaring emission sources are engineered or intentional (e.g., vents from tanks, seal and process 
vents and flare systems), while leak emissions (e.g. working losses from tanks, and leaks from other equipment) 
are unintentional (or uncontrolled). Some emissions are relatively well-characterized, with use of measurement 
systems in certain cases, where losses or flows are tracked as part of routine production accounting procedures, or 
where engineering estimates are made. Uncertainties associated with such estimates include those due to an 
inability to cover the wide range of flows and variations in composition that may occur, and inconsistencies in the 
activities that are included. A lack of data on activities and practices in place in a country can also contribute to 
uncertainty. Throughout this chapter, an effort is made to state the precise type of fugitive emission source being 
discussed, and to only use the term fugitive emissions or fugitive emission sources when discussing these 
emissions or sources at a higher, more aggregated, level. 
Streams containing pure or high concentrations of CO2 may occur at oil production facilities where CO2 is being 
injected into an oil reservoir for EOR, ECBM or EGR. They may also occur at gas processing, oil refining and 
heavy oil upgrading facilities as a by-product of gas treating to meet sales or fuel gas specifications, and at 
refineries and heavy oil upgraders as a by-product of hydrogen production. Where CO2 occurs as a process by-
product it is usually vented to the atmosphere, injected into a suitable underground formation for disposal or 
supplied for use in EOR projects. Fugitive CO2 emissions from these streams should be accounted for under the 
appropriate subcategories of 1.B.2. Fugitive CO2 emissions from CO2 capture should be accounted for in the 
industry where capture occurs, while the fugitive CO2 emissions from transport, injection and storage activities 
shall be accounted for separately in category 1.C (refer to Chapter 5). 
EOR is the recovery of oil from a reservoir by means other than using the natural reservoir pressure. It can begin 
after a secondary recovery process or at any time during the productive life of an oil reservoir. EOR generally 
results in increased amounts of oil being removed from a reservoir in comparison to methods using natural pressure 
or pumping alone. The three major types of enhanced oil recovery operations are chemical flooding (alkaline 
flooding or micellar-polymer flooding), miscible displacement (CO2 injection or hydrocarbon injection), and 
thermal recovery (steamflood or in-situ combustion). 
Emissions from oil and gas exploration are disaggregated to reflect that unconventional completions (e.g., 
conducted with hydraulic fracturing3F4) have a different emissions profile than conventional completions (e.g., 
conducted without hydraulic fracturing). Conventional reservoirs are those in which hydrocarbons are sealed 
below a capstone (or caprock) and from which hydrocarbons readily flow due to natural buoyant forces. 
Unconventional reservoirs, such shale and tight gas, are those for which their characteristics (e.g. porosity, 
permeability) differ from conventional reservoirs.  In the case of unconventional resources, additional techniques, 
such as hydraulic fracturing, are required to stimulate the release and flow of oil and gas from low-permeability 
unconventional formations such as shale. Tier 1 emission factors and methods for calculating emissions from oil 
and gas exploration are differentiated by whether or not hydraulic fracturing is conducted, regardless of formation 
type. Different hydraulic fracturing practices can greatly impact emissions levels. For example, hydraulic 
fracturing completions with flaring or reduced emissions completions (REC) technologies will have lower 
emissions than completions without those practices. In this chapter, unconventional exploration refers to 
exploration that includes well completions with hydraulic fracturing and conventional exploration refers to 
exploration that does not include well completions with hydraulic fracturing. 
 
 
4 There are potential other types of unconventional exploration (e.g. hydrates) but currently hydraulic fracturing is the most 
common type of unconventional exploration.  Emission factors for unconventional exploration were developed from data 
from hydraulic fracturing.

Methodological issues 
Fugitive emissions are a direct source of greenhouse gases due to the release of CH4 and formation CO2 (i.e., CO2 
present in the produced oil and gas when it leaves the reservoir), plus some CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) from 
non-productive combustion activities (primarily waste gas flaring). In this chapter, fugitive emissions include 
emissions from venting, flaring, and leaks. 
Venting comprises all engineered or intentional discharges of waste gas streams and process by-products to the 
atmosphere, including emergency discharges. These releases may occur on either a continuous or intermittent 
basis, and may include the following: 
• Use of pressurized natural gas instead of compressed air as the supply medium for pneumatic devices (e.g., 
chemical injection pumps, starter motors on compressor engines and instrument control loops); 
• Pressure relief and disposal of off-specification product during process upsets; 
• Purging and blowdown events related to maintenance and tie-in activities; 
• Disposal of off-gas streams from oil and gas treatment units (e.g., still-column off-gas from glycol dehydrators, 
emulsion treater overheads and stabilizer overheads); 
• Gas releases from drilling, well-testing and pipeline pigging activities; 
• Disposal of waste associated gas at oil production facilities and casing-head gas at heavy oil wells where there 
is no gas conservation, re-injection, or flaring; 
• Solution gas emissions from storage tanks, evaporation losses from process sewers, API separators, dissolved 
air flotation units, tailings ponds and storage tanks, and biogenic gas formation from tailings ponds; 
• Discharge of CO2 extracted from the produced natural gas or produced as a process by product. 
Some or all of the vented gas may be captured for storage or utilization. In this instance, the inventory of vented 
emissions should include only the net emissions to the atmosphere. 
Flaring means broadly all burning of waste natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids by flares or incinerators as a 
disposal option rather than for the production of useful heat or energy. The decision on whether to vent or flare 
depends largely on the amount and energy content of gas to be disposed of and the specific circumstances (e.g., 
public, environmental and safety issues as well as local regulatory requirements). Normally, waste gas is only 
vented if it is non-odorous and non-toxic, and even then may often be flared. Flaring is most common at production, 
processing, upgrading and refining facilities but may occur in other segments as well. Waste gas volumes are 
usually vented on gas transmission systems and may be vented on gas distribution systems, depending on the 
circumstances and the company’s policies. Sometimes fuel gas may be used to enrich a waste gas stream so it will 
support stable combustion during flaring. Fuel gas may also be used for other purposes where it may ultimately be 
vented or flared, such as purge or blanket gas and supply gas for gas-operated devices (e.g., for instrument 
controllers). The emissions from these types of fuel uses should be reported under the appropriate venting and 
flaring subcategories rather than under Category 1.A (Fuel Combustion Activities). 
Formation CO2 removed from natural gas by the sweetening units at gas processing plants (i.e., for acid gas 
removal) and released to the atmosphere is a fugitive emission and should be reported under subcategory 1.B.2.b.iii 
The CO2 resulting from the production of hydrogen at refineries and heavy oil/bitumen upgraders should be 
reported under subcategory 1.B.2.a.iv. Care should be taken to ensure that the feedstock for the hydrogen plant is 
not also reported as fuel in these cases. 
Leak emissions occur in all segments of the oil and natural gas systems and consist of unintentional (i.e., not vented 
or flared) emissions from equipment components such as valves, connectors, open ended lines, and flanges. 
Fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems are often difficult to quantify accurately. This is largely due 
to the diversity of the industry, the large number and variety of potential emission sources, the wide variations in 
emission-control levels and the limited availability of emission-source data. The main emission assessment issues 
are: 
• The use of simple production-based emission factors introduces large uncertainty; 
• The application of rigorous bottom-up approaches requires expert knowledge and detailed data that may be 
difficult and costly to obtain; 
• Measurement programmes are time consuming and very costly to perform; 
• Certain emissions, such as those from tanks, can be difficult to access or dangerous for direct measurement.

It is good practice to involve technical representatives from the industry and others with expert knowledge in the 
development of the inventory for the use of technology- or practice-specific Tier 1 emission factors and/or for 
input on Tier 2 or 3 approaches. 
4.2.2.1 CHOICE OF METHOD, DECISION TREES, TIERS 
There are three methodological tiers for determining fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems, as set 
out in Section 4.2.2.2. It is good practice to disaggregate the activities into the segments in Oil Systems, and 
separately, in Natural Gas Systems (see Figure 4.2.0 in Section 4.2.1, and Table 4.2.2 below), and then evaluate 
the emissions separately for each of these. The methodological tier applied to each segment should be 
commensurate with the amount of emissions and the available resources. Consequently, it may be appropriate to 
apply different methodological tiers to different segments and sub-segments, and possibly even include actual 
emission measurement or monitoring results for some larger sources. The overall approach, over time, should be 
one of progressive refinement to address the areas of greatest uncertainty and consequence, and to capture the 
impact of control measures. 
Figure 4.2.1 provides a general decision tree for selecting an appropriate approach for a given segment of the 
natural gas industry. The decision tree is intended to be applied successively to each segment within the natural 
gas system (e.g., gas exploration, gas production, then gas processing, then gas transmission, then gas storage, 
then gas distribution, abandoned wells, post-meter emissions, and other), and then separately, to each segment 
within the oil system (e.g., oil production, transport systems, refineries, abandoned wells, and other). 
The basic decision process is as follows: 
• check if the detailed data needed to apply a Tier 3 approach are readily available, and if so, then apply a Tier 
3 approach (i.e., regardless of whether the category is key and the segment is significant), otherwise, if these 
data are not readily available; 
• check if the detailed data needed to apply a Tier 2 approach are readily available, and if so, then apply a Tier 
2 approach, otherwise, if these data are not readily available; 
• check to see if the category is key and the specific segment being considered is significant based on the IPCC 
definitions of key and significant, and if so, go back and gather the data needed to apply a Tier 3 or Tier 2 
approach, otherwise, if the segment is not significant; 
• apply a Tier 1 approach. 
The ability to use a Tier 3 approach will depend on the availability of detailed production statistics and 
infrastructure data (e.g., information regarding the numbers and types of facilities and the amount and type of 
equipment used at each site), and it may not be possible or appropriate to apply it under all circumstances. As 
noted above, oil and gas systems can show significant variability across regions and over time. Compilers should 
make efforts to ensure that emission factors are nationally and temporally appropriate. A Tier 1 approach is the 
simplest method to apply but is susceptible to substantial uncertainties and may easily be in error by an order-of-
magnitude or more. For this reason, it should only be used as a last resort option. Where a Tier 3 approach is used 
in one year and the results are used to develop Tier 2 emission factors for use in other years, the applied 
methodology should be reported as Tier 2 in those other years. 
Where a country has estimated fugitive emissions from oil and gas systems based on a compilation of estimates 
reported by individual oil and gas companies, this may either be a Tier 2 or Tier 3 approach, depending on the 
actual approaches applied by individual companies and facilities. In both cases, care needs to be taken to ensure 
there is no omitting or double counting of emissions. 
It is likely that most countries will estimate emissions from oil and natural gas systems using a combination of 
tiers across and even within segments and subsegments. Tier 1 EFs disaggregated by segment are provided in 
Section 4.2.2.3. The Tier 1 factors presented in this section are aggregates of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. 
To develop separate estimates for venting, flaring, and leak emissions, default fractions of emissions for venting, 
flaring, and leaks for relevant emission factors are provided in Annex 4A.2.

4.2.2.2 CHOICE OF METHOD 
The three methodological tiers for estimating fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems are described 
below. 
TIER 1 
Tier 1 comprises the application of appropriate default emission factors to a representative activity parameter 
(usually throughput) for each applicable segment or subsegment of a country’s oil and natural gas industry and 
should only be used as specified in the decision trees. The application of a Tier1 approach is illustrated with 
Equations 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 presented below. More detailed equations and guidance can be found in Section 4.2.2.3.

EFgas,industry segement 
= emission factor  for CO2, CH4, or N2O (tonnes/unit of activity) 
A industry segement 
= activity value (units of activity) 
The industry segments to be considered are listed in Table 4.2.2. Not all segments will necessarily apply to all 
countries. For example, a country that only imports natural gas and does not produce any will probably only have 
gas transmission and distribution emissions. The available Tier 1 default emission factors are presented in Table 
4.2.4 through 4.2.4k in Section 4.2.2.3. Several options for activity data are available for many of the factors.  For 
each segment, at least one factor option has been related to throughput, because production, imports and exports, 
and consumption are the only national oil and gas statistics that are consistently available. Throughput emission 
factors are applicable to throughput at standard conditions of 15°C and 101.325 kPa. For more information on 
standard temperature and pressure conditions, and conversions from different conditions, see Annex 4A.1. 
In addition, for many segments, technology- or practice-specific emission factors are available. Information on the 
appropriate use of each factor is included in Section 4.2.2.3 for each technology-specific factor. 
Compilers are to assess which Tier 1 factors are most appropriate and should consider other sources or a more 
disaggregated EF (by emission type; see Annex 4A.2) if the emission factors presented here are expected to vary 
significantly from national circumstances. 
Fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas related CO2 capture and injection activities (e.g., acid gas 
injection and EOR projects involving CO2 floods) will normally be small compared to the amount of CO2 being 
injected (e.g., less than 1 percent of the injection volumes). At the Tier 1 or 2 methodology levels they are 
indistinguishable from fugitive greenhouse gas emissions by the associated oil and gas activities. The emission 
contributions from CO2 capture and injection were included in the original data from which the presented Tier 1 
factors were developed (i.e., through the inclusion of acid gas injection and EOR activities, along with 
conventional oil and gas activities, with consideration of CO2 concentrations in the leaked, vented and flared 
natural gases, vapours and acid gases). Losses from CO2 capture should be accounted for in the industry where 
capture occurs, while losses from, transport, injection and storage activities are assessed separately in Chapter 5. 
TIER 2 
Tier 2 consists of using Tier 1 equations (4.2.1 and 4.2.2) with country-specific, instead of default, emission 
factors. It should be applied to significant segments in key categories where the use of a Tier 3 approach is not 
practicable. The country-specific values may be developed from studies and measurement programmes, or be 
derived by initially applying a Tier 3 approach and then back-calculating Tier 2 emission factors using Equations 
4.2.1 and 4.2.2. For example, some countries have been applying Tier 3 approaches for particular years and have 
then used these results to develop Tier 2 factors for use in subsequent years until the next Tier 3 assessment is

4.44 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
performed. In general, all emission factors (including Tier 1 and Tier 2 values) should be periodically re-affirmed 
or updated. The frequency at which such updates are performed shall be commensurate with the rates at which 
new technologies, practices, standards and other relevant factors (e.g., changes in the types of oil and gas activities, 
aging of the fields and facilities, etc.) are penetrating the industry. New data shall be assessed to determine whether 
the data are representing different practices, equipment, or conditions, or if it is an additional data point to be 
included in the emission factor applied across all time series years. A survey of operations for information on 
practices over time could be used to make such an assessment. If new emission factors developed in this manner 
account for real changes within the industry, they should not be applied backwards through the time series. 
An alternative Tier 2 approach that may be applied to estimate the amount of venting and flaring emissions from 
the production segment of oil systems consists of performing a mass balance using country-specific production 
volumes, gas-to-oil ratios (GORs), gas compositions and information regarding the level of gas conservation. This 
approach may be applied using Equations 4.2.3 to 4.2.8 below and is appropriate where reliable venting and flaring 
values are unavailable but representative GOR data can be obtained and venting and flaring emissions are expected 
to be the dominant sources of fugitive emissions (i.e., most of the associated gas production is not being 
captured/conserved or utilized). Under these circumstances, the alternative Tier 2 approach may also be used to 
estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from EOR activities provided representative associated gas and vapour 
analyses are available and contributions due to fugitive emissions from the CO2 transport and injection systems 
are small in comparison (as would normally be expected). Where the alternative Tier 2 approach is applied, any 
reported venting or flaring data that may be available for the target sources should not also be accounted for as this 
would result in double counting. However, it is good practice to compare the estimated gas vented and flared 
volumes determined using the GOR data to the available reported vented and flared data to identify and resolve 
any potential anomalies (i.e., the calculated volumes should be comparable to the available reported data, or greater 
if these latter data are believed to be incomplete). In the case that Tier 2 vented and flared data are applied for 
certain segments, leak emissions should be calculated separately using other data, for example, disaggregated Tier 
1 emissions factors (see Annex 4A.2) 
Table 4.2.3 shows examples of typical GOR values for oil wells from selected locations. Actual GOR values may 
vary from 0 to very high values depending on the local geology, state of the producing reservoir and the rate of 
production. Notwithstanding this, average GOR values for large numbers of oil wells tend to be more predictable. 
A review of limited data for a number of countries and regions indicates that average GOR values for conventional 
oil production would usually be in the range of about 100 to 350 m3/m3, depending on the location. When country-
specific GORs are used, care should be taken to ensure that GOR measurements are performed with enough 
frequency to ensure representative results.

6 Referenced at standard conditions of 15°C and 101.325 kPa. 
To apply a mass balance method in the alternative Tier 2 approach, it is necessary to consider the fate of all of the 
produced gas and vapour. This is done, in part, through the application of a conservation efficiency (CE) factor 
which expresses the amount of the produced gas and vapour that is captured and used for fuel, produced into gas 
gathering systems or re-injected. A CE value of 1.0 means all gas is conserved, utilized or re-injected and a value 
of 0 means all of the gas is either vented or flared. Values may be expected to range from about 0.1 to 0.95. The 
lower limit applies where only process fuel is drawn from the produced gas and the rest is vented or flared. A value 
of 0.95 reflects circumstances where there is, generally, good access to gas gathering systems and local regulations 
emphasize vent and flare gas reduction.

primary heavy oil wells, usually most of the waste gas is flared. 
FE

or fully burned). Typically, a value of 0.995 is assumed for flares at refineries and a 
value 0.98 is assumed for those used at production and processing facilities. 
Xsoot 
= fraction of the non-CO2 carbon in the input waste gas stream that is converted to 
soot or particulate matter during flaring. In the absence of any applicable data this 
value may be assumed to be 0 as a conservative approximation. 
EFN2O 
= emission factor for N2O from flaring (Gg/103 m3 of associated gas flared). Refer to 
the IPCC emission factor database (EFDB), manufacturer’s data or other appropriate 
sources for the value of this factor.

42.3x10-3 kmol/m3) times a unit conversion factor of 10-3 Gg/Mg which brings the 
results of each applicable equation to units of Gg/y. 
The values of ECH4, oil prod, venting and ECO2, oil prod, venting in Equations 4.2.6 and 4.2.7 are estimated using Equation 
4.2.3. 
It should be noted that Equation 4.2.5 accounts for emissions of CO2 using a similar approach to what is done for 
fuel combustion in Section 1.3 of the Introduction chapter of the Energy Volume. The term yCO2 in this equation 
effectively accounts for the amount of raw (or formation CO2) present in the waste gas being flared. The terms 
NcCH4 ● yCH4 and NcNMVOC ● yNMVOC in Equation 4.2.5 account for the amount of CO2 produced per unit 
of CH4 and NMVOC oxidized. 
TIER 3 
Tier 3 comprises the application of a rigorous bottom-up assessment by primary type of source (e.g., venting, 
flaring, equipment leaks, evaporation losses and accidental releases) at the individual facility level with appropriate 
accounting of contributions from temporary and minor field or well-site installations. It should be used for key 
categories where the necessary activity and infrastructure data are readily available or are reasonable to obtain. 
Tier 3 should also be used to estimate emissions from surface facilities where EOR, EGR and ECBM are being 
used in association with CCS. Approaches that estimate emissions at a less disaggregated level than this (e.g., 
relate emissions to the number of facilities or the amount of throughput) are deemed to be equivalent to a Tier 1

approach if the applied factors are taken from the general literature, or a Tier 2 approach if they are country-
specific values. 
The key types of data that would be utilized in a Tier 3 assessment would include the following: 
• Facility inventory, including an assessment of the type and amount of equipment or process units at each facility, 
and major emission controls (e.g., vapour recovery, waste gas incineration, etc.); 
• Inventory of wells and minor field installations (e.g., field dehydrators, line heaters, well site metering, etc.); 
• Country-specific flare, vent and process gas analyses for each subcategory; 
• Facility-level acid gas production, analyses and disposition data; 
• Reported atmospheric releases due to well blow-outs and pipeline ruptures;. 
• Country-specific emission factors for fugitive equipment leaks, unaccounted/unreported venting and flaring, 
flashing losses at production facilities, evaporation losses, etc.; 
• The amount and composition of acid gas that is injected into secure underground formations for disposal. 
Oil and gas projects that involve CO2 injection as a means of enhancing production (e.g., EOR, EGR and ECBM 
projects) or as a disposal option (e.g., acid gas injection at sour gas processing plants) should distinguish between 
the CO2 capture, transport, injection and sequestering part of the project, and the oil and gas production portion of 
the project. The net amount of CO2 sequestered and the fugitive emissions from the CO2 systems should be 
determined based on the criteria specified in Chapter 5 for CO2 capture and storage. Any fugitive emissions from 
the oil and gas systems in these projects should be assessed based on the guidance provided here in Chapter 4 and 
will exhibit increasing concentrations of CO2 over time in the emitted natural gas and hydrocarbon vapours. 
Accordingly, the applied emission factors may need to be periodically updated to account for this fact. Also, care 
should be taken to ensure that proper total accounting of all CO2 between the two portions of the project occurs. 
4.2.2.3 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTOR 
Oil and gas technologies and practices and therefore, emissions, can vary greatly from country to country and over 
time. Data availability may also vary between countries and change over time. Tier 1 emission factors are listed in 
the tables below by segment. Tier 2 and 3 emission factors are also discussed below. It is likely that many countries 
will use a combination of tiers to calculate emissions across petroleum and natural gas systems. 
TIER 1 
Tier 1 default emission factors for each segment of oil and natural gas systems are presented in tables below. Each 
factor represents emissions per year. 
Several options for activity data are available for many of the factors. For each segment, at least one factor option 
has been related to throughput, because production, imports and exports, and consumption are often the only 
national oil and gas statistics that are consistently available in many countries. However, fugitive emissions may 
be more dependent on other factors. An improved basis for estimating emissions for many sources might use other 
activity data (e.g. length of pipeline). The tables in Section 4.2.2.3 provide options for emission factors to be 
applied to other activity data where possible, and where appropriate. In addition, for many segments, technology- 
or practice-specific emission factors are available. Information on the appropriate use of each factor is included 
for each technology-specific factor. Compilers are to assess which Tier 1 factors are most appropriate and should 
consider other sources or a more disaggregated EF (see Annex 4A.2) if the emission factors presented here are 
expected to vary significantly from national circumstances. 
The Tier 1 factors presented in this section are aggregates of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. To develop 
separate estimates for venting, flaring, and leak emissions, default fractions of emissions in each category for 
relevant emission factors are provided in Annex 4A.2. 
It should be noted that the default EFs listed in Tables 4.2.4 to 4.2.4k are sensitive to temperature and pressure. 
Activity data must be consistent with the EFs standard conditions. For more information on conversions to standard 
temperature and pressure, please see Annex 4A.1. 
The factors in Tables 4.2.4 to 4.2.4k are derived using detailed emission inventory results from the United States, 
Canada, Australia, Germany, and other countries, and, where possible, have been updated from the values 
previously presented in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines to reflect the results of more current and refined emissions 
inventories. In many cases, technology- and practice-specific emission factors are presented, so that an inventory 
compiler may select factors that best represent industry practices in the country. While the emission factor options 
are meant to cover technologies and practices that are common in the oil and gas industries, technologies and 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
4.48 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
practices can vary significantly. In addition, the accuracy of factors is dependent on the uncertainty of underlying 
data. A country should periodically assess changes in technologies and practices, and changes in available 
emissions data, and consider updating estimates using at least a Tier 2 approach, per good practice. 
Oil Systems 
1 B 2 a i  Exploration4F5 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (including equipment leaks, venting and flaring) from all field activities 
prior to production (e.g. prospecting and exploratory well drilling, well/drill stem testing and completions).5F6 In 
this segment, factors are not disaggregated to drilling, testing and servicing operation; EFs are applied to the whole 
segment. 
In Table 4.2.4, several options for onshore exploration emission factors inclusive of venting, flaring, and leaks are 
presented. Each technology/practice-specific emission factor is presented in units of tonne per oil well drilled, 
tonne per active oil well, and in tonnes per thousand cubic meter oil produced. The count of wells drilled is thought 
to best reflect emissions from exploration and if available should be applied.  However, the inventory compiler 
should assess which activity data are available and which activity data basis best reflects emissions in that segment 
for that country. 
Emission factors are available for both onshore unconventional and onshore conventional oil exploration.  
Offshore exploration emissions data are unavailable, and these emissions are thought to be negligible; therefore, 
emission factors are not included for offshore exploration. Here, unconventional oil exploration refers to 
exploration where hydraulic fracturing well completion practices are used, and conventional oil exploration refers 
to exploration where hydraulic fracturing well completion practices are not used. 
The extent of any hydraulic fracturing activities in the country should be assessed. Unconventional completions 
(i.e., conducted with hydraulic fracturing) have a different emissions profile than conventional completions (i.e., 
conducted without hydraulic fracturing). This is reflected in the emission factors below. Where possible, the 
compiler should separate national activity data into conventional and unconventional categories and apply the 
relevant emission factors. If only total oil wells or total oil production data are available, the compiler should 
develop an estimate of the annual split between conventional and unconventional wells or conventional and 
unconventional production in the country to develop the activity data. Unconventional factors are to be applied to 
the unconventional activity data basis. Where wells drilled are completed with hydraulic fracturing and flaring and 
gas recovery is not practiced, or where the extent of flaring or recovery practices is unknown, the first set of factors 
(“Unconventional without flaring or recovery”) should be used and applied to the relevant activity data (i.e. 
unconventional wells drilled, total unconventional well population, or unconventional production). Where wells 
drilled are completed with hydraulic fracturing and flaring and gas recovery is used, the fraction of the relevant 
activity data that uses flaring and/or gas recovery should be determined. The second set of factors 
(“Unconventional with flaring”) is used for that fraction, while the first set of factors is applied to the wells or 
production that are not using flaring or recovery. Conventional factors (“Conventional”) are to be applied to the 
conventional activity data basis. As technologies and practices change over time, it is possible that one EF will be 
used in some years and another in other years. A compiler should assess the time frame over which changes took 
place, and consider linear interpolation or other techniques to incorporate the trend from one emission factor to 
another over the time series.  
Factors presented are inclusive of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. For cases where country-specific data are 
available for a subcomponent of the factor (e.g. venting and flaring emissions), disaggregated Tier 1 EF that could 
be applied to estimate the remaining emission types are available—see Annex 4A.2 for information (including 
examples) on how to calculate disaggregated emissions. 
Definitions for oil wells versus gas wells can vary from country to country and organization to organization. The 
Tier 1 EFs in the table below were developed from emissions occurring in U.S. basins identified as having 
predominantly oil production. Emission factors were developed using data on exploration emissions (drilling, 
testing, and completions) for wells with a gas oil ratio of </= 17,000 cubic meters gas to cubic meters oil. If national 
criteria defines oil and gas wells, follow the national criteria or national documentation to make the distinction. 
What is most important is that all emissions are transparently allocated to either oil or gas systems, without 
omission. 
For each sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4 below that is occurring in the country, compilers must calculate 
emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.9. It is recognized that not all countries will have all sub-
 
5 Some countries expressed several technical concerns with the validity and reliability of the newly added equations and default 
emission factors for fugitive emissions from oil exploration. The countries expressed that the newly added guidance is 
premature and needs further work before it can be used. 
6 Refracturing and redrilling emissions are to be included in 1.B.2.a.ii (Production and Upgrading).

1 B 2 a ii Production and Upgrading 
This segment includes fugitive emissions from oil production (including leaks, venting, and flaring) from the oil 
wellhead or at the oil sands or shale oil mine through to the start of the oil transmission system. On-site crude oil 
processing (i.e. removing water and gases contained in crude oil) is also included in this segment. Emissions arise 
from the wells themselves (e.g., as wellhead leaks and from well workovers and refractures), and well-site 
equipment such as pneumatic controllers, dehydrators and separators. This includes fugitive emissions related to 
oil sands or shale oil mining, transport of untreated production (i.e. well effluent, emulsion, oil shale and oil sands) 
to treating or extraction facilities, activities at extraction and upgrading facilities, associated gas re-injection 
systems and produced water disposal systems. Fugitive emissions from upgraders are grouped with those from 
production rather than those from refining since the major product from upgraders (i.e. synthetic crude oil) requires 
further processing at refineries. Upgraders are often integrated with extraction facilities and may also be integrated 
with refineries, co-generation plants or other industrial facilities, making their relative contributions difficult to 
establish. 
Table 4.2.4a presents factors for onshore oil production, and offshore oil production.  
Countries with onshore oil production should apply a factor for onshore production to the relevant activity data 
for onshore production. Factors for onshore production (other than for oil sands) are presented both in units of 
tonne per active oil well, and in tonnes per thousand cubic meter oil produced. The count of wells is thought to 
best reflect emissions from oil production, and if complete and accurate well count data are available, they should 
be applied. However, the inventory compiler should assess which activity data are available and which activity 
data basis best reflects emissions in that segment for that country. The types of technologies and practices in use 
in the country should be assessed, including the extent of associated gas venting and flaring, and use of controls at 
tanks. Where this information is unknown, or where more than 5 percent of associated gas is vented, or more than 
30 percent of tank throughput is uncontrolled (e.g. without flaring or vapour recovery units (VRUs)), the first set 
of emission factors for oil production (“Most activities occurring with higher-emitting technologies and practices”) 
should be used. Where lower-emitting technologies are used extensively (e.g. associated gas is used or flared 
instead of vented, most tanks are controlled), the second set of emission factors (“Most activities occurring with 
lower-emitting technologies and practices”) for oil production should be used. The emission factors for onshore 
production were developed from data sets that included a mix of production from wells in conventional formations 
and wells in unconventional formations and are considered to be applicable to both. As technologies and practices 
change over time, it is possible that one EF will be used in some years and another in other years. A compiler 
should assess the time frame over which changes took place, and consider linear interpolation or other techniques 
to incorporate the trend from one emission factor to another over the time series. 
Countries with offshore oil production should apply a factor for offshore oil production. If no data are available to 
estimate the share of oil production that occurs offshore, the EF for onshore production should be applied to the 
total quantity of oil production. 
Production from oil sands is treated separately and should use emission factors for “Oil Sands Mining and Ore 
Processing” and “Oil Sands Upgrading” to calculation emissions for that subset of oil production.  
Oil sands are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit made of up a mixture of sand, clay, and water, saturated 
with a highly viscous form of petroleum called crude bitumen. Crude bitumen is an extra-heavy oil with an API 
gravity below 10°API. In its natural state, it is not usually recoverable at commercial rates through a well because 
it is too thick to flow. There are two methods that are used to recover crude bitumen, depending on the depth of 
the deposit. Bitumen that occurs near the surface can be recovered by open-pit mining. In this method, overburden 
is removed, oil sands ore is mined, and bitumen is recovered from the mined material in large facilities using hot 
water and solvents. When the resource is located too deep to make surface mining economical, in situ extraction 
methods are utilized. In situ extraction takes place both through primary extraction methods, similar to 
conventional crude oil, and enhanced extraction. The two main methods of enhanced recovery are cyclic steam 
stimulation (CSS) and steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). Both methods use steam to heat the reservoir 
allowing the bitumen to flow to a vertical or horizontal wellbore. Due to the large quantities of both hot water and 
steam needed to extract the bitumen, co-generation plants are often co-located with the extraction facilities. 
Once the bitumen is produced using surface mining or in situ methods, it can be upgraded to synthetic crude oil 
(SCO) or lighter hydrocarbon products at an upgrader and then transported to a refinery for further processing. 
Upgraders improve the quality of the crude bitumen by adding hydrogen, removing carbon, or both. During the 
upgrading process, most of the sulphur and other impurities are removed. The produced bitumen can also be mixed 
with a less viscous material (referred to as diluent), such as SCO or condensate, allowing the mixture to flow 
through a pipeline. 
Fugitive emissions from in situ extraction include leaks, venting and flaring that occur at the well pad through to 
the start of the oil transmission system. Open pit mining extraction of crude bitumen also includes fugitive 
emissions from leaks, venting and flaring. Additional methane present in the oil sands ore is released during 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions

4.53 
mining, mine dewatering, and ore transport, crushing and handling activities. Waste tailings are created during the 
extraction process consisting of unrecovered solvent, bitumen, water, sand, clay and other impurities. Fugitive 
emissions from tailings ponds occur as microbial and bacterial degradation of hydrocarbons and vegetation present 
at the bottom of the ponds produces methane gas. The upgrading process produces fugitive emissions of leaks, 
venting and flaring, including CO2 venting from sulphur recovery operations and the hydrogen production process. 
Factors presented are inclusive of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. For cases where country-specific data are 
available for a subcomponent of the factor (e.g. venting and flaring emissions), disaggregated Tier 1 EF that could 
be applied to estimate the remaining emission types are available—see Annex 4A.2 for information (including 
examples) on how to calculate disaggregated emissions. 
Definitions for oil wells versus gas wells can vary from country to country and organization to organization. The 
onshore production (other than oil sands) Tier 1 EFs in the table below were developed from emissions occurring 
in U.S. basins identified as having predominantly oil production. Emission factors were developed using data on 
production emissions for wells with a gas oil ratio of </= 17,000 cubic meters gas to cubic meters oil. If national 
criteria defines oil and gas wells, follow the national criteria or national documentation to make the distinction. 
What is most important is that all emissions are transparently allocated to either oil or gas systems, without 
omission. 
For each segment/sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4a below that is occurring in the country, compilers must 
calculate emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.10. It is recognized that not all countries will have 
all segments and sub-segments occurring.

1 B 2 a iii  Transport 
This segment includes venting and leakage emissions related to the transport of marketable crude oil (including 
conventional, heavy and synthetic crude oil and bitumen), etc. to upgraders and refineries. The transportation 
systems may comprise pipelines, tank trucks and rail cars, tanks, and tanker ships. Evaporation losses from storage, 
filling and unloading activities and fugitive equipment leaks are the primary sources of these emissions. Two sets 
of factors are available for tanker ships. Where tanker ship use of VRU is infrequent or unknown, the factor for 
“Loading of offshore production on tanker ships without VRU” should be used. Where tanker ship use of VRU is 
common, the factor for “Loading of offshore production on tanker ships with VRU” should be used. It is important 
to note that the emissions might vary greatly from loading to loading and are strongly influenced by several factors, 
including composition and temperature of the crude oil, how the loading system is designed and operated, whether 
the cargo tanks on the vessel contain hydrocarbon gases, inert gases or a mixture of these when the loading 
operation starts, and weather conditions and wave heights during loading. 
For each segment/sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4b below that is occurring in the country, compilers must 
calculate emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.11. It is recognized that not all countries will have 
all segments and sub-segments occurring.

1 B 2 a iv  Refining 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (including leaks, venting, and flaring) at petroleum refineries. Refineries 
process crude oils, natural gas liquids and synthetic crude oils to produce final refined products (e.g., primarily 
fuels and lubricants) and in some plants even hydrogen (see Box 4.2.1 below). Methane emission sources include 
storage tanks, blowdowns, asphalt blowing, equipment leaks, vents, loading operations, wastewater treating, 
cooling towers, catalytic cracking/reforming/fluid cracking, flares, delayed coking, and coke calcining. Carbon 
dioxide emissions included under 1.B.2.a.iv include asphalt blowing, calcination, anode production, process vents, 
and flaring. For additional information on catalyst regeneration and calcination, see Box 4.2.2. Where refineries 
are integrated with other facilities (for example, upgraders or co-generation plants) their relative emission 
contributions can be difficult to establish in measurement studies. The emission factors presented in Table 4.2.4c 
represent petroleum refinery emissions only. 
BOX 4.2.1 (NEW) 
HYDROGEN PRODUCTION. FUGITIVE EMISSIONS AND REFINERIES 
The Tier 1 method for refinery fugitives already accounts for emissions associated with Hydrogen 
production. Where a Tier 2 or Tier 3 method is applied to estimate emissions from the refinery sector, 
it is good practice for compilers to check whether the method already accounts for emissions from 
Hydrogen production on the refinery: 
If applying a Tier 2 method for refinery GHG emissions, does the country-specific emission factor 
already account for emissions from hydrogen production? If applying a Tier 3 method for refinery 
GHG emissions, does the method (e.g. country-specific model, aggregated installation-level 
estimates or directly reported emissions estimates) already account for the emission from hydrogen 
production? 
Where they do not, then an appropriate method from the IPPU sector, as presented in the IPPU 
Hydrogen chapter (Ch. 3.11, Vol. 3 IPPU), may be applied to account for GHG emissions from the 
Hydrogen production within the refinery. 
 
BOX 4.2.2 (NEW) 
NOTES ON CATALYST REGENERATION AND CALCINATION 
The process-related coke deposit at the catalyst leads to less effectiveness. With the coke burn-off, 
the catalyst is regenerated. The controlled burn-off of the catalyst coke takes place within the 
refinery and the thermal energy is usually re-used. Carbon dioxide emissions from this process are 
reported under 1.A.1.b. It is good practice to develop a country specific emission factor. As activity 
data, the relevant quantity of petroleum coke could be obtained from the national petroleum statistic 
or the emission trading system (ETS), as applicable. If this information is not available, a default 
emission factor of 28.3 kg CO2/t crude oil input 6F7 can be used. 
During calcination, the hydrocarbons contained in the petroleum coke are burned at high 
temperatures in order to obtain calcine (calcined coke). The emissions arising in this process are 
reported under 1.B.2.a.iv. The default factor specified in Table 4.2.4c includes calcination.

(N2O values from refineries were unavailable) in 2006 IPCC Guidelines, which was then applied to corresponding CO2 values for refineries in this table. The factors include fugitive equipment leaks, flaring, storage 
of crude oil, handling and calcination.

1 B 2 a v  Distribution of Oil Products 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (including leaks and venting) from the transport and distribution of 
refined products, including those at bulk terminals and retail facilities. Evaporation losses from storage, filling and 
unloading activities and equipment leaks are the primary sources of these emissions. Many products are directly 
used in the chemical industry and should be considered in the appropriate subcategory (e.g. Volume 3 Chapter 3). 
Table 4.2.4d below provides emission factors for major fuel types. The emission factors consider emissions from 
refinery dispatch or border dispatch stations, to depots and further distribution to end-users (e.g. gas stations and 
airports). It is assumed that a fractional distillation in the refinery separated gaseous components from fuels. 
Therefore, only NMVOC emissions factors are provided. Tier 1 emission factors are currently available for only 
a subset of the total types of oil products distributed. 
For each sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4d below that is occurring in the country, compilers must calculate 
emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.12. It is recognized that not all countries will have all segments 
and sub-segments occurring.

a.       The NMVOC emission factors are developed from the (German Government 2018) inventory values for 2016 for unabated distribution of fuels and include transhipping from tanker to tanks, 
refuelling of cars, permeation in refuelling hoses and dripping losses. Several techniques like vapour-balancing and vapour-recovery along with use of automatic monitoring systems will have a 
significant influence on the factor, in which country-specific EFs should be developed to reflect reduction efficiency and level of application of such techniques. 
b. 
Note from 2006 IPCC Guidelines: “Estimated based on assumed average evaporation losses of 0.15 percent of throughput at the distribution terminal and additional losses of 0.15 percent of 
throughput at the retail outlet. These values will be much lower where Stage 1 and Stage 2 vapour recovery occurs and may be much greater in warmer climates.”

1 B 2 a vi  Other 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (leaks, venting and flaring) from oil systems that are not otherwise 
accounted for in the other categories. This includes fugitive emissions from spills and other accidental releases, 
waste oil treatment facilities and oilfield waste disposal facilities. 
Anomalous leak events can occur across oil systems and can have highly variable emissions.  Examples of such 
events include releases from emergency pressure relieving equipment such as emergency shutdowns (ESD), 
emergency safety blowdowns (ESB) and breakout/surge tanks (American Petroleum Institute (API) 2009). It is 
good practice to quantify and report such emissions whenever possible under 1 B 2 a vi (“Other”).  There is no 
Tier 1 method available for such events, which need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, often using a 
combination of emission factors and engineering calculations. An example of calculating emissions during 
emergency conditions though an engineering calculation approach is given in (American Petroleum Institute (API) 
2009). 
1 B 2 a vii  Abandoned Oil Wells 
When production activities are completed, oil wells may be abandoned. Several reasons of well abandonment 
exist: if wells have fulfilled their purpose; after the surrender of a production license; due to geological reasons; 
due to technical reasons; due to technological, ecological and other reasons. Countries with a long history of oil 
and gas production may have a significant abandoned well population and should estimate emissions for this 
source. 
For onshore wells ending production in recent decades, the abandonment process is often covered by national (or 
regional) well abandonment regulations. Regulated wells are often treated with plugging and other practices prior 
to abandonment/decommissioning to prevent leakage from the wells and migration of oil, gas or brine to 
surrounding strata. That process can be generally described as follows. The wells are plugged (with the use of 
plugging materials, e.g. cement) and sealed according to the regulations and considering reasons of 
decommissioning, geological conditions, and other well specifics. If these steps are implemented effectively and 
the long-term integrity of the well does not fail over time, it is unlikely that the well will leak substantial amounts 
of methane. However, in practice integrity failure of some abandoned wells may occur and the well may start 
leaking methane to the atmosphere. This is consistent with findings of recent studies in the U.S. and U.K., which 
have found that the majority of effectively plugged wells are not leaking, but a small number will have some 
emissions (e.g., Townsend-Small et al. 2016, Kang et al. 2016, Boothroyd et al. 2016). 
Tier 1 default emission factors are presented in Table 4.2.4e. All of the presented emission factors are expressed 
in units of mass of emissions per abandoned well. Available information on abandoned wells do not indicate a 
clear distinction between abandoned oil and abandoned gas wells regarding practices or emission rates. Thus, all 
the EFs are developed from data for both abandoned oil and gas wells. It should be noted that factors provided for 
abandoned wells have high uncertainty, which is reflected in the uncertainty ranges provided in the table. The EFs 
of abandoned wells are split into either “plugged” (or, properly decommissioned per regulations) and “unplugged” 
well sub-segments. The distinction requires the number of each type of abandoned well (plugged or unplugged). 
Existing data on abandoned oil and gas wells as well as practices for their plugging status may be limited and/or 
difficult to collect. If insufficient data on plugging practices is available to disaggregate activity data in such a 
way, the default EF for all type wells is to be used. More limited data are available on offshore wells and 
disaggregated (i.e. plugged versus unplugged) factors for offshore abandoned wells are developed from onshore 
wells data considering that most methane (around 98 percent) from offshore abandoned wells is dissolved in 
marine water. 
Based on available data, emission factors (and leak frequency) do not vary over the time series per well; according 
to the latest research, well integrity failure rate shows no significant trend over time. If failures do exist, they more 
likely occur early on in the decommissioned life of a well (Boothroyd et al. 2016). Based on the latest research, 
gas well emission rates may be higher than oil well emissions rates. However, due to limited data points in the 
currently available data, Tier 1 EFs were not disaggregated into oil-specific and gas-specific factors.  In cases 
where national circumstances are different from listed above, a country should consider using a Tier 2 or Tier 3 
approach. 
Activity data for this source are counts of abandoned onshore and offshore wells in each year of the time series, 
and for onshore wells, the fraction of wells that are effectively plugged.  It may be challenging to compile a total 
national count of abandoned wells and to assess whether wells are plugged or unplugged. The compiler should 
review national, local, or regional records and consult with industry to develop an estimate. There is also likely 
significant variation between post-well closure practices internationally and even within countries.

This segment includes fugitive emissions (including equipment leaks, venting and flaring) from gas field activities 
prior to production (e.g., prospecting and exploratory well drilling, well/drill stem testing, and well completions).8F9 
In this segment, factors are not disaggregated to drilling, testing and servicing operation; EFs are applied to the 
whole segment. 
In Table 4.2.4f several options for onshore exploration emission factors inclusive of venting, flaring and leaks are 
presented. Each technology/practice-specific emission factor is presented in units of tonne per gas well drilled, 
tonne per active gas well, and in tonnes per million cubic meter gas produced. The count of wells drilled is thought 
to best reflect emissions from exploration and if available should be applied. However, the inventory compiler 
should assess which activity data are available and which activity data basis best reflects emissions in that segment 
for that country. 
Emission factors are available for both onshore unconventional and onshore conventional gas exploration. 
Offshore exploration emissions data are unavailable, and these emissions are thought to be negligible; therefore, 
emission factors are not included for offshore exploration. Here, unconventional gas exploration refers to 
exploration where hydraulic fracturing well completion practices are used, and conventional gas exploration refers 
to exploration where hydraulic fracturing well completion practices are not used. 
The extent of any hydraulic fracturing activities in the country should be assessed. A potential data source for this 
assessment is the International Energy Agency’s database for unconventional gas production (International Energy 
Agency (IEA) 2018). Unconventional completions (i.e., conducted with hydraulic fracturing) have a different 
emissions profile than conventional completions (i.e., conducted without hydraulic fracturing). This is reflected in 
the emission factors below. Where possible, the compiler should separate national activity data into conventional 
and unconventional and apply the relevant emission factors. If only total gas wells or total gas production data are 
available, the compiler should develop an estimate of the annual split between conventional and unconventional 
wells or conventional and unconventional production in the country to develop the activity data. 
Unconventional factors are to be applied to the unconventional activity data basis. Where wells drilled are 
completed with hydraulic fracturing and flaring and gas recovery is not practiced, or where the extent of flaring or 
recovery practices is unknown, the first set of factors (“Unconventional gas exploration without flaring or gas 
capture”) should be used and applied to the relevant activity data (i.e. unconventional wells drilled, total 
unconventional well population, or unconventional production). Where wells drilled are completed with hydraulic 
fracturing and flaring and gas recovery is used, the fraction of the relevant activity data that uses flaring and/or gas 
recovery should be determined. The second set of factors (“Unconventional gas exploration with flaring or gas 
capture”) is used for that fraction, while the first set of factors is applied to the wells or production that is not using 
flaring or recovery. Conventional factors (“Conventional Gas exploration”) are to be applied to the conventional 
activity data basis. As technologies and practices change over time, it is possible that one EF will be used in some 
years and another in other years. A compiler should assess the time frame over which changes took place, and 
consider linear interpolation or other techniques to incorporate the trend from one emission factor to another over 
the time series. For each segment/sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4f below that is occurring in the country, 
compilers must calculate emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.13. It is recognized that not all 
countries will have all segments and sub-segments occurring. Factors listed in Table 4.2.4f apply to onshore 
exploration. Emissions data are unavailable for offshore exploration. 
Factors presented are inclusive of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. For cases where country-specific data are 
available for a subcomponent of the factor (e.g. venting and flaring emissions), disaggregated Tier 1 EF that could 
be applied to estimate the remaining emission types are available—see Annex 4A.2 for information (including 
examples) on how to calculate disaggregated emissions. 
Definitions for oil wells versus gas wells can vary from country to country and organization to organization. The 
Tier 1 EFs in the table below were developed from emissions occurring in U.S. basins identified as having 
predominantly gas production. Emission factors were developed using data on exploration emissions (drilling, 
testing, and completions) for wells with a gas oil ratio of >17,000 cubic meters gas to cubic meters oil. If national 
criteria defines oil and gas wells, follow the national criteria or national documentation to make the distinction. 
What is most important is that all emissions are transparently allocated to either oil or gas systems, without 
omission. 
 
8 Some countries expressed several technical concerns with the validity and reliability of the newly added equations and default 
emission factors for fugitive emissions from gas exploration. The countries expressed that the newly added guidance is 
premature and needs further work before it can be used. 
9 Refracturing and redrilling emissions are to be included in 1.B.2.a.ii (Production and Upgrading).

1 B 2 b ii  Production and Gathering 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (including leaks, venting and flaring) from the gas wellhead through to 
the inlet of gas processing plants, or, where processing is not required, to the tie-in points on gas transmission 
systems. In the production stage, wells are used to withdraw raw gas from underground formations. Emissions 
arise from the wells themselves (e.g., as wellhead leaks and from well workovers and refractures), and well-site 
equipment such as pneumatic controllers, dehydrators and separators. Gathering and boosting emission sources 
are included within the production sector. The gathering and boosting sources include gathering and boosting 
stations (with multiple emission sources on site, such as compressors, pneumatic controllers and tanks) and 
gathering pipelines. The gathering and boosting stations receive natural gas from production sites and transfer it, 
via gathering pipelines, to processing facilities or transmission pipelines. 
The Table 4.2.4g below presents factors for onshore gas production, onshore coal bed methane production, 
gathering systems, and offshore gas production 9F10. 
Countries with onshore gas production should apply a factor for onshore production and the factor for gathering 
to the quantity of onshore gas produced in each year. 
Factors for onshore gas production (other than coal bed methane) are presented both in units of tonne per active 
gas well, and in tonnes per million cubic meter gas produced. The count of wells is thought to best reflect emissions 
from gas production, and if complete and accurate well count data are available, they should be applied. However, 
the inventory compiler should assess which activity data are available and which activity data basis best reflects 
emissions in that segment for that country. The types of technologies and practices in use in the country should be 
assessed, including extent of lower-emitting liquids unloading practices for any liquids unloading occurring, and 
extent of leak detection and repair (LDAR) practices. Where this information is unknown, or where there is limited 
use of lower-emitting technologies (i.e., more than 60 percent of any liquids unloading is conducted without 
venting or with lower-emitting plunger lifts or LDAR is not used extensively), the first set of emission factors 
(“Most activities occurring with higher-emitting technologies and practice”) for onshore gas production should be 
used. Where lower-emitting technologies are used extensively, the second set of emission factors (“most activities 
occurring with lower-emitting technologies and practices”) for gas production should be used. As technologies 
and practices change over time, it is possible that one EF will be used in some years and another in other years. A 
compiler should assess the time frame over which changes took place, and consider linear interpolation or other 
techniques to incorporate the trend from one emission factor to another over the time series. 
The emission factors for onshore production were developed from data sets that included a mix of production from 
wells in conventional formations and wells in unconventional formations and are considered to be applicable to 
both. However, if data on coal bed methane production are available, the factor for coal bed methane production 
may be applied to the portion of gas production that is from coal bed methane. 
Countries with offshore gas production should apply a factor for offshore gas production. If no data are available 
to estimate the share of gas production that occurs offshore, the EF for onshore production should be applied to 
the total quantity of gas production. 
Factors presented are inclusive of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. For cases where country-specific data are 
available for a subcomponent for the factor (e.g. venting and flaring emissions), disaggregated Tier 1 EF that could 
be applied to estimate the remaining emission types are available—see Annex 4A.2 for information (including 
examples) on how to calculate disaggregated emissions. 
Definitions for gas wells versus oil wells can vary from country to country and organization to organization. The 
onshore production (other than coal bed methane) Tier 1 EFs in the table below were developed from emissions 
occurring in U.S. basins identified as having predominantly gas production. Emission factors were developed using 
data on production emissions for wells with a gas oil ratio of >17,000 cubic meters gas to cubic meters oil. If 
national criteria defines gas and oil wells, follow the national criteria or national documentation to make the 
distinction. What is most important is that all emissions are transparently allocated to either gas or oil systems, 
without omission. 
For each sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4g below that is occurring in the country, compilers must calculate 
emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.14. It is recognized that not all countries will have all segments 
and sub-segments occurring. 
 
10 While the emission factor options are meant to cover technologies and practices that are common in the oil and gas industries 
internationally, technologies and practices can vary significantly between regions and over time. A country should 
periodically assess changes in technologies and practices, and changes in available emissions data, and consider updating 
estimates using a Tier 2 approach, per good practice.

1 B 2 b iii  Processing 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (including leaks, venting and flaring) from gas processing facilities. In 
this stage, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and various other constituents (e.g. sulphur) from the raw gas are removed, 
resulting in “pipeline quality” gas, which is injected into the transmission system. Emission sources include 
compressors, equipment leaks, pneumatic controllers, uncombusted gas from engines and flaring, and CO2 from 
flaring and sour gas removal. In the Table 4.2.4h below, several options for emission factors are presented. For 
some emission factors, the factors are presented both in units of tonne per million cubic meter gas processed, and 
in tonnes per million cubic meter gas produced. The volume of gas processed is thought to best reflect emissions 
from gas processing, and if gas processing data are available, they should be applied.  However, the inventory 
compiler should assess which activity data are available and which activity data basis best reflects emissions in 
that segment for that country. The extent of any LDAR programs, and the use of dry seals in centrifugal 
compressors in the country should be assessed. Where this information is unknown, or where there are limited or 
no LDAR programs or less than 50 percent of centrifugal compressors have dry seals, the “without LDAR, and 
less than 50 percent of centrifugal compressors have dry seal” emission factors for Natural Gas Processing should 
be used. Where leak detection and repair programs are in use and around 50 percent of more of centrifugal 
compressors have dry seals, use the “Extensive LDAR, and around 50 percent or more of centrifugal compressors 
have dry seals” emission factors for Natural Gas Processing. As technologies and practices change over time, it is 
possible that one EF will be used in some years and another in other years. A compiler should assess the time 
frame over which changes took place, and consider linear interpolation or other techniques to incorporate the trend 
from one emission factor to another over the time series.  Where sour gas (or “acid gas”) removal is occurring, the 
factor for that source should also be applied to the portion of gas processed with sour gas removal, and added to 
the overall gas processing total. 
Factors presented are inclusive of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. Information for disaggregating the Tier 1 
EFs for processing into leak, vent, and flare emissions is available in Annex 4A.2. 
Town gas originates from outgassing of hard coal under air exclusion in retort furnace or chamber kilns. A 
methodology for this source is not currently available. If a method should become available, emissions from these 
processes could be reported under 1.B.1.c.iv Gasification Transformation. 
For each segment/sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4h below that is occurring in the country, compilers must 
calculate emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.15. It is recognized that not all countries will have 
all segments and sub-segments occurring. The emissions from gas processing (Eprocessing) are computed by 
multiplying the appropriate emission factor from Table 4.2.4h by the amount of gas processed (units of millions 
of cubic meter of gas). If sour gas is removed, this emission should be added to the overall processing emissions, 
where the emissions from sour gas removal is computed as the product of the emission factor for sour gas removal 
from Table 4.2.4h and the amount of sour gas that is processed (in units of millions of cubic meters of sour gas). 
The compiler should attempt to determine the fraction of the gas processed that is sour gas using nationally 
available statistics or industry information on the characteristics of processing plants. If no data is available, it is 
good practice to assume the fraction, for example by considering the study of Burgers et al. 2011 or comparing to 
adjacent countries. If none of the proposals works, a value of 32 percent sour gas10F11 can be applied.

1 B 2 b iv  Transmission and Storage 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (including leaks, venting and flaring) from systems used to transport 
processed natural gas to market (i.e., to industrial consumers and natural gas distribution systems), including 
natural gas storage systems. Natural gas transmission involves high pressure, large diameter pipelines that transport 
gas long distances from field production and processing areas to distribution systems or large volume customers 
such as power plants or chemical plants. Compressor station facilities are used to move the gas throughout the 
transmission system. Emissions from natural gas liquids extraction plants on gas transmission systems should be 
reported as part of natural gas processing (Sector 1.B.2.b.iii). Fugitive emissions related to the transmission of 
natural gas liquids should be reported under 1.B.2.b.iv. Emissions sources include compressors, pneumatic 
controllers, storage wells, leaks and venting from transmission lines, and equipment leaks from compressor 
stations. This source also includes Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) stations and import and export terminals; further 
details on the LNG sector can be found in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) Operations: Consistent Methodology for 
estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions (American Petroleum Institute (API) 2015). In Table 4.2.4i  below, several 
options for emission factors are presented. 
Factors for transmission are presented both in units of tonne per million cubic meter gas consumption, and in 
tonnes per km transmission pipeline. The length of transmission pipeline is thought to best reflect emissions from 
transmission, and if pipeline data are available, they should be applied. However, the inventory compiler should 
assess which activity data are available and which activity data basis best reflects emissions in that segment for 
that country. The extent of any LDAR programs, and the use of dry seals in centrifugal compressors in the country 
should be assessed. Where this information is unknown, or where there are limited or no LDAR programs or less 
than 50 percent of centrifugal compressors have dry seals, the “Limited LDAR or less than 50 percent of centrifugal 
compressors have dry seals” emission factors for transmission should be used. Where leak detection and repair 
programs are in use and around 50 percent of more of centrifugal compressors have dry seals, use the “Extensive 
LDAR, and around 50 percent or more of centrifugal compressors have dry seals” emission factors for 
transmission. Factors for gas storage are presented both in units of tonne per million cubic meter gas consumption, 
as this is the most commonly available data point relevant to gas storage. If other activity data are available (such 
as quantity of gas stored or number of storage stations), the compiler could determine whether a Tier 2 or 3 method 
incorporating the storage data might better represent emissions. For gas storage, the extent of any leak detection 
and repair programs should be assessed. Where this information is unknown, or LDAR is not extensively practiced, 
the first set of emission factors for gas storage (“Limited LDAR or most activities occurring with higher-emitting 
technologies and practices”) should be used. Where there are extensive LDAR programs, the second set of 
emission factors for gas storage (“Extensive LDAR and most activities occurring with lower-emitting technologies 
and practices”) should be used.  
Where LNG imports and exports or storage occur, the number of stations should be determined, and the emission 
factors for LNG should be used. See (American Petroleum Institute (API) 2015) for further elaboration of emission 
estimation methods for the LNG sector (e.g. Tiers 2 and 3).  
As technologies and practices change over time, it is possible that one EF will be used in some years and another 
in other years. A compiler should assess the time frame over which changes took place, and consider linear 
interpolation or other techniques to incorporate the trend from one emission factor to another over the time series. 
Factors presented are inclusive of venting, flaring, and leak emissions. Information for disaggregating the Tier 1 
EF for transmission and storage into leak, vent, and flare emissions is available in Annex 4A.2. 
For each sub-segment listed in Table 4.2.4i below that is occurring in the country, compilers must calculate 
emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.16. It is recognized that not all countries will have all segments 
and sub-segments occurring.

1 B 2 b v  Distribution 
This segment includes fugitive emissions (including leaks, venting, and any flaring) from the distribution of natural 
gas. Distribution pipelines take the high-pressure gas from the transmission system at “city gate” stations, reduce 
the pressure and distribute the gas through primarily underground mains and service lines to individual end users. 
Emission sources include leaks from pipelines, metering and regulating stations, meters and short-term surface 
storage. 
For natural gas distribution, the factors are presented both in units of tonne per million cubic meter gas 
consumption, and in tonnes per km pipeline. The length of distribution pipeline is thought to best reflect emissions 
from distribution, and if pipeline data are available, they should be applied. However, the inventory compiler 
should assess which activity data are available and which activity data basis best reflects emissions in that segment 
for that country. The mix of pipeline materials and extent of any leak detection and repair programs in the country 
should be assessed. Where this information is unknown, or where distribution pipelines are less than 50 percent 
plastic, or where there are limited or no leak detection or repair programs, the first set of emission factors for gas 
distribution should be used (“Less than 50 percent plastic pipelines, or limited or no leak detection and repair 
programs”). Where greater than 50 percent of distribution pipelines are plastic, and leak detection and repair 
programs are in use, use the second set of emission factors for gas distribution (“Greater than 50 percent plastic 
pipelines, and leak detection and repair programs are in use”). As technologies and practices change over time, it 
is possible that one EF will be used in some years and another in other years. A compiler should assess the time 
frame over which changes took place, and consider linear interpolation or other techniques to incorporate the trend 
from one emission factor to another over the time series. Distribution system methane emissions from biogas are 
to be calculated here, and can be calculated using the provided emission factors, provided that methane content of 
the distributed gas is not expected to significantly differ from distributed natural gas. Fugitive emissions of carbon 
dioxide from biogas distribution are considered to be biogenic and are not reported under 1.B.2. 
Short term surface storage means a man-made above-ground storage facilities, for storage of medium-sized 
quantities of natural gas, help meet and balance rapid fluctuations in demand. Spherical and pipe storage tanks, 
and other types of low-pressure containers, are used for this purpose. 
The composition of town gas differs from natural gas (see explanation in introduction to Chapter 4.2) and therefore 
emissions are estimated for town gas using distinct emission factors. 
For each category/subcategory listed in Table 4.2.4j below that is occurring in the country, compilers must

1 B 2 b vi   Post-Meter Emissions 
This segment includes fugitive emissions beyond gas meters and from natural gas-fueled vehicles. The emission 
factors for appliances and power plants include leakage emissions beyond gas meters, such as internal piping and 
the end of pipe appliances (e.g. home heating, water heating, stoves, barbecues). Emissions from start-stop-losses 
of appliances and combustion of gas are not included in the methodology. If the number of appliances using natural 
gas is unknown the number of gas meters or the number of house connections should be used instead multiplied 
by a typical number of appliances (e.g., 2 for countries with heaters and stoves; 1 in warm countries without 
heaters). The emission factor for natural gas-fueled vehicles include releases from dead volumes during fueling, 
emptying of gas cylinders of high-pressure interim storage units, for execution of pressure tests and relaxation of 
residual pressure from vehicles' gas tanks, for pressure tests or decommissioning. 
For each category/subcategory listed in Table 4.2.4k below that is occurring in the country, compilers must 
calculate emissions, and sum them according to Equation 4.2.18. It is recognized that not all countries will have 
all categories and subcategories occurring.

Fugitive emissions (including leaks, venting and flaring) from natural gas systems not otherwise accounted for in 
the above categories. This may include emissions from well blowouts and pipeline ruptures or dig-ins, accidents, 
and emergency pressure releases. It is good practice to quantify and report such emissions as part of category 
1.B.2.b.vii whenever possible. There is no Tier 1 method available for such events, which need to be evaluated on 
a case-by-case basis, often using a combination of emission factors and engineering calculations. An example of 
calculating emissions during emergency conditions though an engineering calculation approach is given in 
(American Petroleum Institute (API) 2009). Other examples of quantifying anomalous leak events include 
CARB’s Aliso Canyon report (California Air Resources Board 2016). 
1 B 2 b viii  Abandoned Gas Wells 
Available information on abandoned oil and gas wells do not indicate a clear distinction between abandoned oil 
and abandoned gas wells regarding practices or emission factors. As such, please refer to the discussion for 
1.B.2.a.vii for background and guidance on abandoned oil wells. The emission factors are presented in Table 
4.2.4e. In the future, as additional data on this source become available, distinct emission factors for oil and gas 
may be possible. 
TIER 3 AND 2 
Emission factors for conducting Tier 3 and Tier 2 assessments are not provided in the IPCC Guidelines due to the 
large amount of such information and the fact these data are continually being updated to include additional 
measurement results and to reflect development and penetration of new control technologies and requirements. 
Rather, the IPCC has developed an EFDB which will be periodically updated and is available at www.ipcc-
nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php. In addition, regular reviews of the literature and country-specific data available 
through inventories of countries with similar circumstances should still be conducted to ensure that the best 
available factors are being used. The references for the chosen values should be clearly documented. Typically, 
emission factors are developed and published by environmental agencies, industry associations and academic 
literature. It may be necessary to develop inventory estimates in consultation with these organizations. For 
example, the API maintains a Compendium of Emissions Estimating Methodologies for the Oil and Gas Industry, 
most recently updated in 2009. The API Compendium is available at (American Petroleum Institute (API) 2009).  
Guidance for estimating greenhouse gas emissions has also been developed by a number of national oil and gas 
industry associations. Such documents may be useful supplemental references and often provide tiered source-
specific calculation procedures. Guidance on inventory accounting principles as they apply to the oil and gas 
industry, and boundary definitions is available in the Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting Greenhouse 
Gas Emissions (International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA) et al. 2011). 
When selecting emission factors, the chosen values must be valid for the given application and be expressed on 
the same basis as the activity data. It also may be necessary to apply other types of factors to correct for site and 
regional differences in operating conditions and design and maintenance practices, for example: 
• Composition profiles of gases from particular oil and gas fields to correct for the amount of CH4, formation 
CO2 and other target emissions; 
• Annual operating hours to correct for the amount of time a source is in active service; 
• Efficiencies of the specific control measures used. 
The following are additional matters to consider in choosing emission factors: 
• It is important to assess the applicability of the selected factors for the target application to ensure similar or 
comparable source behaviour and characteristics. 
• In the absence of better data, it may sometimes be necessary to apply factors reported for other regions that 
practice similar levels of emission control and feature comparable types of equipment. 
• Where measurements are performed to develop new emission factors, only recognised or defensible test 
procedures should be applied. The method and quality assurance (QA)/quality control (QC) procedures should 
be documented, the sampled sources should be representative of typical variations in the overall source 
population and a statistical analysis should be conducted to establish the 95 percent confidence interval on the 
average results. 
• Whether and how the emission factors may change over time due to changes in technologies or practices.

4.2.2.4 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The activity data required to estimate fugitive emissions from oil and gas activities includes production statistics, 
infrastructure data (e.g., inventories of facilities/installations, process units, pipelines, and equipment 
components), and reported emissions from spills, accidental releases, and third-party damages. The basic activity 
data required for each tier and each type of primary source are summarized in Table 4.2.6, Typical Activity Data 
Requirements for each Assessment Approach by Type of Primary Source Category. Production statistics provided 
by national bureaux should be used in favour of those available from international bodies, such as the IEA or the 
UN, due to their generally better reliability and disaggregation. Regional, provincial/state and industry reporting 
groups may offer even more disaggregation. 
TIER 1 
The activity data required at the Tier 1 level has been limited to information that may either be obtained directly 
from typical national oil and gas statistics or easily estimated from this information. Table 4.2.7 below lists the 
relevant activity data for each of the Tier 1 emission factors presented in Tables 4.2.4 to 4.2.4k, and gives 
appropriate guidance for obtaining or estimating each of the required activity values. 
TIER 2 
The activity data required for the standard Tier 2 methodological approach is the same as that required for the Tier 
1 approach. If the alternative Tier 2 approach described in Section 4.2.2.2 for crude oil systems is used, then 
additional, more detailed, information is required including average GOR values, information on the extent of gas 
conservation and factors for apportioning waste associated gas volumes between venting and flaring. This 
additional information should be developed based on input from the industry.

In general, values should be directly referenced from national statistics. Note that not all values present in the table 
will be needed to calculate emissions. For most calculations, several emission factors are provided to correspond 
with different activity data options. The inventory compiler should assess which activity data are available and 
which activity data basis best reflects emissions in that segment for that country.

TIER 3 
Approaches and level of disaggregation for Tier 3 estimates can vary widely. In the case of Tier 3, Table 4.2.6 lists 
examples of some activity data that might be used for Tier 3 estimates. 
Specific matters to consider in compiling the detailed activity data required for use in a Tier 3 approach include 
the following: 
• Production statistics should be disaggregated to capture changes in throughputs (e.g., due to imports, exports, 
reprocessing, withdrawals, etc.) in progressing through oil and gas systems. 
• Production statistics provided by national bureaux should be used in favour of those available from 
international bodies, such as the IEA or the UN, due to their generally better reliability and disaggregation. 
Regional, provincial/state and industry reporting groups may offer even more disaggregation. 
• Production data used in estimating fugitive emissions should be corrected, where applicable, to account for any 
net imports or exports. It is possible that import and export data may be available for a country while production 
data are not; however, it is unlikely that the opposite would be true. 
• Where coalbed methane is produced into a natural gas gathering system, any associated fugitive emissions 
should be reported under the appropriate natural gas exploration and production categories. This will occur by 
default since the produced gas becomes a commodity once it enters the gas gathering system and automatically 
gets accounted for the same way gas from any other well does when it enters the gathering system. The fact 
that gas is coming from a coal formation would only be discernible at a very disaggregated level. Where a coal 
formation is degassed for the purposes of coal exploration or coal mining and handling, the associated 
emissions should be allocated to the coal sector under the appropriate section of IPCC category 1.B.1. 
• Vented and flared volumes from oil and gas statistics may be highly suspect since these values are usually 
estimates and not based on actual measurements. Additionally, the values are often aggregated and simply 
reported as flared volumes. Operating practices of each segment of the industry should be reviewed with 
industry representatives to determine if the reported volumes are actually vented or flared, or to develop 
appropriate apportioning of venting relative to flaring. Audits or reviews of each industry segment should also 
be conducted to determine if all vented and flared volumes are actually reported (for example, solution gas 
emissions from storage tanks and treaters, emergency flaring/venting, leakage into vent/flare systems, and 
blowdown and purging volumes may not necessarily be accounted for). 
• Infrastructure data are more difficult to obtain than production statistics. Information concerning the numbers 
and types of major facilities and the types of processes used at these facilities may often be available from 
regulatory agencies and industry groups, or directly from the actual companies. 
• Information on minor facilities (e.g., numbers of field dehydrators and field compressors) usually is not 
available, even from oil and gas companies. Consequently, assumptions must be made, based on local design 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.91 
practices, to estimate the numbers of these facilities. This may require some fieldwork to develop appropriate 
estimation factors or correlations. 
• Many companies use computerised inspection-and-maintenance information management systems. These 
systems can be a very reliable means of counting major equipment units (e.g., compressor units, process heaters 
and boilers, etc.) at selected facilities. Also, some departments within a company may maintain databases of 
certain types of equipment or facilities for various internal reasons (e.g., tax accounting, production accounting, 
insurance records, quality control programmes, safety auditing, license renewals, etc.). Efforts should be made 
to identify these potentially useful sources of information. 
• Component counts by type of process unit may vary dramatically between facilities and countries due to 
differences in design and operating practices. Thus, while initially it may be appropriate to use values reported 
in the general literature, countries should strive to develop their own values. 
• Use of consistent terminology and clear definitions is critical in developing counts of facilities and equipment 
components, and to allow any meaningful comparisons of the results with others. 
• Some production statistics may be reported in units of energy (based on their heating value) and will need to 
be converted to a volume basis, or vice versa, for application of the available emission factors. Typically, where 
production values are expressed in units of energy, it is in terms of the gross (or higher) heating value of the 
product. However, where emission factors are expressed on an energy basis it is normally in terms of the net 
(or lower) heating value of the product. To convert from energy data on a gross calorific value (GCV) basis to 
a net calorific value (NCV) basis, the International Energy Agency assumes a difference of 5 percent for oil 
and 10 percent for natural gas. Individual natural gas streams that are either very rich or high in impurities may 
differ from these average values. Emission factors and activity data must be consistent with each other. 
• Oil and gas imports and exports will change the activity levels in corresponding downstream portions of these 
systems. 
• Production activities will tend to be the major contributor to fugitive emissions from oil and gas activities in 
countries with low import volumes relative to consumption and export volumes. Gas transmission and 
distribution and petroleum refining will tend to be the major contributors to these emissions in countries with 
high relative import volumes. Overall, net importers will tend to have lower specific emissions than net 
exporters. 
4.2.2.5 COMPLETENESS 
Completeness is a significant issue in developing an inventory of fugitive emissions for the oil and gas industry. 
It can be addressed through direct comparisons with other countries and, for refined inventories, through 
comparisons between individual companies in the same industry segment and subcategory. This requires the use 
of consistent definitions and classification schemes. For example, in Canada, the upstream petroleum industry has 
adopted a benchmarking scheme that compares the emission inventory results of individual companies in terms of 
production-energy intensity and production-carbon intensity. Such benchmarking allows companies to assess their 
relative environmental performance. It also flags, at a high level, anomalies or possible errors that should be 
investigated and resolved. 
The Tier 1 EF and their associated uncertainty ranges presented in Tables 4.2.4 to 4.2.4k may be used to assess 
reasonableness of Tier 2 and Tier 3 factors. If emissions from specific segments are appreciably less than the low 
end or greater than the high end of the uncertainty range, this should be explained; otherwise, it may be an 
indication of possible missed or double counted contributions, respectively. 
Where emission inventories are developed based on a compilation of individual company-level inventories, care 
should be taken to ensure that all companies are included. Appropriate extrapolations may be needed to account 
for any non-reporting companies. 
Smaller individual sources, when aggregated nationally over the course of a year, may often be significant total 
contributors. Therefore, good practice is not to disregard them. Once a thorough assessment has been done, a basis 
exists for simplifying the approach and better allocating resources in the future to best reduce uncertainties in the 
results. 
Where a country has estimated its fugitive emissions from part or all of its oil and natural gas system based on a 
roll-up of estimates reported by individual oil and gas companies, it is good practice to document the steps taken 
to ensure that these results are complete, transparent and consistent across the time series. Corrections made to 
account for companies or facilities that did not report, and measures taken to avoid missed or double counting 
(particularly where ownership changes have occurred) and to assess uncertainties should be highlighted. 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
4.92 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Where Tier 2 or Tier 3 approaches are used to calculate a subset of emissions (e.g. flaring), care should be taken 
to ensure that all remaining emissions (e.g. venting and fugitives) are accounted (e.g. using disaggregated Tier 1 
factors in Appendix 4A.2). 
4.2.2.6 DEVELOPING CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Ideally, emission estimates will be prepared for the base year and subsequent years using the same method. The 
aim is to have emission estimates across the time series reflect true trends in greenhouse gas emissions. Emission 
or control factors that change over time (e.g., due to changes in source demographics or the penetration of control 
technologies) should be regularly updated and, each time, only applied to the period for which they are valid. For, 
example, if an emission control device is retrofit to a source then a new emission factor will apply to that source 
from then onwards; however, the previously applied emission factor reflecting conditions before the retrofit should 
still be applied for all previous years in the time series. If an emission factor has been refined through further 
testing and now reflects a better understanding of the source or source category, then all previous estimates should 
be updated to reflect the use of the improved factor and be reported in a transparent manner. 
Tier 1 emission factors provided in Tables 4.2.4 to 4.2.4k are technology/practice-specific to the extent possible.  
A country should assess which technologies and practices are generally in place in the country and apply the 
corresponding emission factor.  As technologies and practices change over time, it is possible that a country will 
use one EF in some years and another in other years.  A compiler should assess the time frame over which changes 
took place, and consider linear interpolation or other techniques to incorporate the trend from one emission factor 
to another over the time series. 
Where some historical data are missing, it should still be possible to use source-specific measurement results 
combined with back-casting techniques to establish an acceptable relationship between emissions and activity data 
in the base year. Approaches for doing this will depend on the specific situation, and are discussed in general terms 
in Volume 1 Chapter 5 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
If emission estimates are developed based on a roll-up of individual company estimates, greater effort will be 
required to maintain time series consistency, particularly where frequent facility ownership changes occur and 
different methodologies and emission factors are applied by each new owner without also carrying these changes 
back through the time series. 
4.2.2.7 UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Sources of error that may occur include the following: 
• Measurement errors; 
• Extrapolation errors; 
• Inherent uncertainties of the selected estimation techniques; 
• Missing or incomplete information regarding the source population and activity data; 
• Poor understanding of temporal and seasonal variations in the sources; 
• Over or under accounting due to confusion or inconsistencies in category divisions and source definitions; 
• Misapplication of activity data or emission factors (including due to incomplete information for assigning 
technology- and practice-specific emission factors); 
• Errors in reported activity data; 
• Missed accounting of intermediate transfer operations and reprocessing activities (for example, re-treating of 
slop oil, treating of foreign oil receipts and repeated dehydration of gas streams: in the field, at the plant, and 
then following storage); 
• Differences in the effectiveness of control devices, potential deterioration of their performance over time and 
missed accounting of control measures. 
Guidance regarding the assessment of uncertainties in emission factors and activity data are presented in the 
subsections below. 
4.2.2.7.1 EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
The uncertainty in an emission factor will depend both on the accuracy of the measurements upon which it is based 
and the degree to which these results reflect the average behaviour of the target source population, including 
 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions 
 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.93 
whether the measurements capture any high-emitting subpopulations (e.g., malfunctions) and episodic sources and 
whether these have been incorporated into the average factors in a way that does not over- or under-estimate total 
emissions. Accordingly, emission factors developed based on data measured in one country may have one set of 
uncertainties when the factors are applied in that country and another set of uncertainties when they are applied 
similarly in a different country. Thus, while it is difficult to establish one set of uncertainties that will always apply, 
a set of default values has been provided for the default factors provided in Tables 4.2.4 through 4.2.4k. These 
uncertainties are estimated based on expert judgement and reflect the level of uncertainty that may be expected 
when the corresponding emission factors are used to develop emission estimates at the national level. Use of the 
presented factors to estimate emissions from individual facilities or sources would be expected to result in much 
greater uncertainties. 
4.2.2.7.2 ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
The percentages cited in this section are based on expert judgement and aim to approximate the 95 percent 
confidence interval around the central estimate. Gas compositions are usually accurate to within ±5 percent on 
individual components. Flow rates typically have errors of ±3 percent or less for sales volumes and ±15 percent or 
more for other volumes. Production statistics or disposition analyses may not agree between different reporting 
agencies even though they are based on the same original measurement results (e.g. due to possible differences in 
terminology and potential errors in summarising these data). These discrepancies may be used as an indication of 
the uncertainty in the data. Additional uncertainty will exist if there is any inherent bias in the original measurement 
results (for example, sales meters are often designed to err in favour of the customer, and liquid handling systems 
will have a negative bias due to evaporation losses). Random metering and accounting errors may be assumed to 
be negligible when aggregated over the industry. 
Where available, counts of major facilities (e.g., gas plants, refineries and transmission compressor stations) may 
be known with little error (e.g., less than 5 percent). Where errors in these counts occur it is usually due to some 
uncertainties regarding the number of new facilities built and old facilities decommissioned during the time period. 
Counts of well site facilities, minor field installations and gas gathering compressor stations, as well as the type 
and amount of equipment at each site, will be much less accurately known, if known at all (e.g., at least ±25 percent 
uncertainty or more). 
Estimates of emission reductions from individual control actions may be accurate to within a few percent to ±25 
percent depending on the number of subsystems or sources considered. 
4.2.3 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 6 of the 2006 IPCC 
Guidelines, Tier 1 General Inventory Level QC Procedures, and expert review of the emission estimates. 
Additional quality control checks, as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 5 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and quality 
assurance procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions 
from this source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as 
identified in Volume 1 Chapter 4 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
In addition to the guidance in Volume 1 Chapter 6 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, specific procedures of relevance 
to this source category are outlined below. 
REVIEW OF DIRECT EMISSION MEASUREMENTS 
If direct measurements are used to develop country-specific emission factors, the inventory compiler should 
establish whether measurements at the sites were made according to recognised standard methods. If the 
measurement practices fail this criterion, then the use of these emissions data should be carefully evaluated, 
estimates reconsidered and qualifications documented. The compiler should also assess key background 
information in the study, such as, what activities are occurring and what equipment is in place (including controls) 
at the time of measurement and whether the measurements are representative of average conditions for that activity 
and may be applied as an average factor, or if it should be adjusted for different operating practices, etc. The 
compiler should confirm that the categorizations (e.g. for equipment and practices) used in the study are the same 
as used in the inventory, and should make adjustments if not.  The national representativeness of the factors should 
also be assessed. As applicable, the attribution of measured emissions to the specific equipment or broader category 
should also be assessed. 
ACTIVITY DATA CHECK 
Several different types of activity data may be required for this source category, depending on which 
methodological tier is used to estimate the emissions. Where activity data are available from multiple sources (i.e. 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
4.94 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
from national statistics and industry organisations) these data sets should be checked against each other to assess 
reasonableness. Significant differences in data should be explained and documented. Trends in the main emission 
drivers and activity data over time should be checked and any anomalies investigated. 
EXTERNAL REVIEW AND STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT 
Emission inventories for large, complex oil and gas industries may be susceptible to errors due to missed or 
unaccounted for sources, or due to customization of average emission factors taken from a data source that 
represents estimates from another country or region with operating characteristics different from those in the 
country where the emission factor is being applied. To minimise such errors, it is important to obtain active 
involvement of industry and other technical experts in the preparation and refinement of these inventories. This 
will be especially important in the selection of appropriate technology- and practice-specific emission factors. 
4.2.4 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates, as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 8 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
It may not be practical to include all supporting documentation in the inventory report. However, at a minimum, 
the inventory report should include summaries of the methods used and references to source data such that the 
reported emissions estimates are transparent and the steps in their calculation may be retraced. For segments where 
a technology- or practice-specific Tier 1 emission factor is used, the rationale for selecting that factor and the 
method for applying the factors over the time series must be clearly documented. It is expected that many countries 
will use a combination of methodological tiers to evaluate the amount of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from 
the different parts of their oil and natural gas systems. The specific choices should reflect the relative importance 
of the different subcategories and the availability of the data and resources needed to support the corresponding 
calculations. Table 4.2.9 is a sample template, with some example data entries, that may be used to conveniently 
summarize the applied methodologies and sources of emission factors and activity data. Tier 1 EF are inclusive of 
venting, flaring, and leak emissions.  For calculations, compilers may separate their emissions into the separate 
categories of venting, flaring and leaks if data are available.  Emissions reported for each segment should be 
inclusive of venting, flaring, and leak emissions (i.e., should represent the total emissions for that segment). If a 
compiler choses to report disaggregated data on venting and flaring, they may do so as information items. The best 
global data available to develop technology-specific tier 1 emission factors currently does not have a clear 
distinction between leaks, venting, and flaring, although we make a best estimate of this split in the annex. To 
maintain consistent reporting between the tiers, the worksheet 1.B.2 has been appropriately revised.  
Since emission factors and estimation procedures are continually being improved and refined, it is possible for 
changes in reported emissions to occur without any real changes in actual emissions. Accordingly, the basis for 
any changes in results between inventory recalculations should be clearly discussed and those due strictly to 
changes in methods and factors should be highlighted. 
The issue of confidential business information will vary from region to region depending on the number of firms 
in the market and the nature of the business. The significance of this issue tends to increase in progressing 
downstream through the oil and gas industry. A common means to address such issues where they do arise is to 
aggregate the data using a reputable independent third party.  
Where inventory data may be considered confidential, fugitive emissions can be reported based on the level of 
aggregation at which information can still be reported while protecting confidentiality. For more guidance on data 
aggregation and other approaches for use of confidential data, see Volume 1, Section 2.2 “Restricted data and 
confidentiality”. 
The above reporting and documentation guidance is applicable to all methodological choices. Where Tier 3 
approaches are employed, it is important to ensure that either the applied procedures are detailed in the inventory 
report or that available references for these procedures are cited since the IPCC Guidelines do not describe a 
standard Tier 3 approach for the oil and gas sector. There is a wide range in what potentially may be classified as 
a Tier 3 approach, and correspondingly, in the amount of uncertainty in the results. If available, summary 
performance and activity indicators should be reported to help put the results in perspective (e.g. total production 
levels and transportation distances, net imports and exports, and specific energy, carbon and emission intensities). 
Reported emission results should also include a trend analysis to show changes in emissions, activity data and 
emission intensities (i.e., average emissions per unit of activity indicator) over time. The expected accuracy of the 
results should be stated and the areas of greatest uncertainty clearly noted. 
The current trend by some government agencies and industry associations is to develop detailed methodology 
manuals and reporting formats for specific segments and subcategories of the industry. This is perhaps the most 
practical means of maintaining, documenting and disseminating the subject information. However, all such

initiatives must conform to the common framework established in the IPCC Guidelines so that the emission results 
can be compared across countries.

4.3 
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM FUEL 
TRANSFORMATION 
Fuel transformation occurs when energy products are transformed into other energy products more suitable for 
their end use. Transformation occurs by physical or chemical conversion into a product whose intrinsic properties 
differ from those of the original product (e.g. charcoal production; or coke oven carbonization of coal); or by 
aggregation and blending of products, sometimes involving a change of the physical shape (e.g. briquetting of 
brown coal) (UNSD, 2018). 
4.3.1 
Overview and description of sources 
This section is a new guidance. It clarifies how fugitive emissions from fuel transformation should be estimated. 
Emissions from these fuel transformation activities link to the Energy, IPPU and AFOLU sectors and cross 
references are provided to the relevant sections in the guidelines. Inventory compilers should ensure all emissions 
from specific fuel transformation activities are captured in their inventories but are not double counted. 
Fugitive emissions from two groups of transformation process have been included in this section: 
• Solid to solid transformation processes (charcoal production; coke production). The organisation of this 
section is based on the transformation of the physical state of the fuel; 
• Gasification transformation processes (coal to liquids; gas to liquids). The organisation of this section is 
based on the technologies used. 
The boundaries for all these transformation activities are the respective transformation process boundaries, and 
fugitive emissions in upstream and downstream supply chains are to be estimated using appropriate methodologies 
elsewhere in these guidelines, including in other volumes. 
Other transformation processes (e.g. patent fuel, coal briquetting, town gas production) are not explicitly 
addressed. If parties have country specific methodologies available, they may report emissions in these categories. 
Hydrogen production is considered in Volume 3, Chapter 3.11; refineries are considered in Chapter 4.2 in this 
volume. 
The major sources are summarised in Table 4.3.1 below. 
Table 4.3.2 provides cross references to the locations in the guidelines for the methods for estimating fugitive 
emissions from the transformation, and, shows the categories where emissions should be reported. Compilers 
should note carefully the differences in reporting of CO2 from biomass and fossil feedstock. For more information 
on treatment of biomass emissions, please see Section 2.3.3.4 of Volume 2, Chapter 2.

Methodological issues 
4.3.2.1 SOLID TO SOLID TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES 
CHARCOAL AND BIOCHAR PRODUCTION 
About half the wood extracted worldwide from forests is used to produce energy, mostly for cooking and heating. 
Some of the wood is used to make charcoal. The share of energy use from harvested wood is as high as 90 percent 
in Africa and more than 60 percent in Asia. An estimated 17 per cent of wood extracted from forests was converted 
to charcoal (FAO, 2016), natural forest and forest plantation as wood for energy may differ in its production, and 
most of the remainder was used in the form of fuelwood. Charcoal production can be on very small scales 
(domestic) to larger scales (industrial), and is normally poorly regulated with little or no emission control. 
Emissions from harvested wood energy use are due largely to unsustainable forest management, inefficient 
charcoal manufacture and woodfuel combustion (FAO, 2017; AFREA, 2011). Of these sources, the solid to solid 
transformation process only covers emission from inefficient charcoal manufacture.  
Charcoal is produced by the carbonization of wood. Carbonization of fuel is the thermal decomposition in the 
absence of oxygen at a temperature above 300○C. The carbonization of wood produces charcoal, volatile 
compounds and a range of gases. The gases produced include direct greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O), indirect 
greenhouse gases (CO) and other gases, including H2. Emissions of biogenic CO2 from charcoal production are 
reported here as an information item, and are covered under Agriculture, Land Use Change and Forestry (AFOLU). 
Fugitive emissions of CH4 and N2O are reported here. 
Some biochar is also produced from harvested wood, which is mainly applied in soils (please refer to AFOLU 
Chapter for details) and also some biochar produced could be used for making biochar briquettes that are used for 
energy purposes. Charcoal and biochar are produced by the pyrolysis method but under different conditions.  
Traditional kiln technologies for charcoal production are slow and without treatment of the pyrolysis gases, 
resulting in emissions of gases (mainly methane and carbon monoxide) and aerosols that are both toxic and 
contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. In retort kilns normally used for biochar production, pyrolysis gases are 
led back to a combustion chamber and these pyrolytic gases are recirculated and combusted internally to produce 
around 75% lower deleterious gas emissions (mainly CO, CH4, aerosols) and higher conversion efficiencies of 30–
45% than traditional systems.   
Emissions of biogenic CO2 from biochar production are reported here as an information item, and are covered 
under AFOLU. Fugitive emissions of CH4 and N2O are reported here.

CHOICE OF METHODS, DECISION TREES, TIERS 
Figure 4.3.1 shows the decision tree for estimating fugitive emissions from charcoal production activities. For 
countries with kiln-level charcoal production data, or kiln type data, and who have kiln efficiency or emission 
factor data available, a Tier 3 estimation could be applied. For countries where country level charcoal production 
data is available, a country specific EF may be estimated and applied in a Tier 2 approach. However, if fugitive 
emissions from fuel transformation are a key category, and charcoal production is a significant source within that 
category, estimate emissions using higher tiers. If fugitive emissions are not a significant source, then emissions 
can be estimated using a Tier 1 method. A similar approach should to be followed for biochar production.

The general form of the equation for estimating emissions for Tier 1 approach, based on charcoal production

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Preference must be given to sourcing accurate charcoal production data. Charcoal production might be available 
in national energy balances. The quantities of charcoal produced might be recorded by statistical agencies, and 
could be estimated from the weight or volume of wood used to make charcoal or biochar. Total charcoal production 
can be estimated by measuring the charcoal produced in each kiln countrywide each year. Measurement is done 
by weighing the bags of charcoal produced at each site. If gravimetric production activity is not available, 
quantities of charcoal produced can be approximately estimated from the product of the number of charcoal bags 
filled assuming the weight of each bag is known. Estimates of production made in this way should not be used for 
an inventory, but could be used to help verify production data from other sources. A similar approach can be 
followed for biochar production. Biochar production data should include the total national value of biochar 
production.   
If no country specific charcoal production data are available, wood charcoal production according to country 
maybe available at http://www.fao.org/faostat/. 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
The uncertainty associated with charcoal (or biochar) production is high as the use of this fuel is typically not 
accurately recorded at national level, and, most of the traditional charcoal (or biochar) makers do not measure the 
quantities of charcoal produced. Uncertainties associated with the charcoal production data might be available 
from statistical data. If such data are not available, then expert elicitation and expert judgement can be used. The 
uncertainties associated with the emission factors are very high. The emission factors depend on the type of kiln 
and corresponding efficiency. Since most of the charcoal (or biochar) is produced by traditional mound methods, 
which are not standardized, the emission factors will necessarily be highly uncertain. Emission factors are not 
available by kiln type. 
COKE PRODUCTION 
To ensure the estimates of total fugitive GHG emissions from coke production are complete, emissions should be 
estimated from unintentional leakage during the coke production process and from any venting or flaring of coke 
oven gases. 
Volume 2: Energy

                2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Please refer to Section 4.2, Volume 3 for the methods to estimate process emissions from metallurgical coke 
production.  Figure 4.3.2 provides a simplified diagram of a coke oven plant showing the possible types and sources 
of fugitive emissions. 
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS FROM UNINTENTIONAL LEAKAGE 
Coke is produced by the pyrolysis of coal. This is a managed thermal treatment of the coal which limits combustion 
or oxidation of the coal or coke product. Coal pyrolysis at high temperature is called carbonisation. The process 
produces coke, volatile compounds and a range of other gases. In the coke production process, the coal is heated 
indirectly up to 1 000 – 1 100°C for 14 – 28 hours (JRC, 2013).  
Coke is the most important reducing agent used in primary metal production. Other uses of coke include as a 
heating fuel and feedstock. 
Globally the production of coking coal and associated coke oven gas (COG) is significant. Coke oven gas is a by-
product of production of coke oven coke in coke ovens, mainly from coking coal. In 2016, coking coal production 
was 1 040 Mt, derived coke oven coke production was 668 Mt, and coke oven gas production was 3129 PJ (IEA, 
2016). 
Only certain coals, for example coking or bituminous coals, with the right properties, can be converted to coke 
and a coking plant may blend several types to improve coke production and extend coke battery life. Other 
materials which contain carbon can also be included in small quantities (e.g. petroleum coke, shredded tyres). Oil 
or oil residues can also be added. 
Older technologies include comparatively simple coke kilns or retorts which represent a low capacity basic 
technology with varying levels of pollution control and energy efficiency.  This type of coking technology has 
been largely phased out in most countries (Huo et al., 2012). Since the 1940s, the coke production process has 
been mechanised and the materials used in the construction of the ovens have been improved without significant 
design modifications. Horizontal chamber coking is the most common type of coke oven. A horizontal coke oven 
battery may contain up to 70 ovens as large as 14 m long and 6 m high. Because of heat transfer considerations, 
oven widths have remained at between 0.3 and 0.6 m. Each oven in the battery holds up to 30 tonnes of coal. Some 
recently constructed coke oven plants have increased dimensions further.  
The technology used in coke ovens can be simplified into 2 main types (AISTech, 2010): 
1. Heat recovery, with no by-product recovery 
By-products released from the coking process are combusted within the oven. This provides the heat 
required for the coke-making process. The oven is a horizontal design and operates under negative pressure 
which means fugitive emissions from the coke oven during operation should be negligible. Primary 
combustion air is introduced though ports in the oven doors which partially combusts the volatiles in the 
oven chamber. Secondary air is introduced to complete the combustion process in flues which run under the 
coal bed. Heat can still be recovered from hot exhaust gases and be used for the production of heat and 
electricity – in such arrangements the system is called heat recovery coke making. As most of the by-
products are combusted in the oven this technique eliminates the need for costly flue gas and wastewater 
treatment infrastructure. Heat recovery coking has a smaller output of blast furnace coke compared to 
conventional coke-making systems, but, it provides more flexibility for coal selection than conventional slot 
ovens. Flaring of COG is very unlikely. 
2. Non-heat recovery, with by-product recovery 
By product coke making is so called because the volatile matter evolved during the coking process is 
collected and refined into by-product chemicals. The coking process is performed in narrow, tall slot ovens 
which operate under a non-oxidizing atmosphere. A positive pressure within the oven cavity prevents air 
ingress and subsequent combustion of the volatile matter. However this positive pressure may increase 
fugitive emissions, particularly if the door seals are not fully effective. Ovens typically range in height from 
4 m up to 8 m in the latest plants. Taller ovens allow greater amounts of coke to be produced per oven, 
therefore minimizing the number of charges and pushes and related emissions to make the needed tonnage. 
Volatiles driven off during the coking process pass through a collector main to the by-product chemical 
plant. Flaring of COG is possible. 
Heat recovery coke making has gained importance during recent years, although this technique is not applied in 
Europe to date. Only approximately 5 percent of worldwide coke making facilities are operated as heat recovery 
plants. There are relevant plants in the US, South America, Asia and Australia. (JRC, 2013). Heat recovery coke 
making needs oven systems which differ in design when comparing with conventional horizontal chamber systems 
(JRC, 2013). 
Figure 4.3.2 shows a typical flow diagram of a coke oven plant showing all sources of emissions. The processes 
in the diagram have been generalized, and apply to both heat recovery and non-heat recovery plants.

The coke-making process can be subdivided into several stages. Fugitive emissions of varying intensities are 
possible at each of these stages: 
• coal handling and preparation; 
• battery operation (coal charging, heating/firing, coking, coke pushing, coke quenching); 
• coke oven gas (COG) treatment with recovery and treatment of by-products in the case of a conventional coking 
plant; recovery of the heat of the coking and treatment of the flue gas in the case of a heat recovery coking 
plant. 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
CHOICE OF METHODS, DECISION TREES, TIERS 
There are many potential sources of fugitive emissions from the coking process. Table 4.3.4 provides a summary 
of emissions sources and reporting location according to coke production processing stage. 
Inventory compilers who are using a carbon mass balance approach to estimate emissions from the iron and steel 
sector, and are including fugitive emissions in this balance, should not use the methods in this section to estimate 
emissions of CO2 to avoid double counting.

Fugitive emissions can occur during coking operations from leakages at the battery, for example, because of 
leakage from vessels, oven doors, flanges, or at the by-product plant. Fugitive emissions occur also from the 
ascension pipe and charging hole sealings. The magnitude of these emissions will depend on the coke oven 
technology and the level of maintenance. The variability in the magnitude of fugitive emissions will be large. 
Specific door emissions vary widely depending upon the type of doors, the size of ovens and the quality of 
maintenance. Maintenance can be a determining factor. Examples of good results with traditional (knife-edged) 
doors on well-maintained small ovens and poor results with modern flexible sealing doors on poorly maintained 
large ovens can be found (Eurofer, 2007). 
Because of the high costs of leakage monitoring, there is very little actual data available for fugitive emissions 
caused by battery operation. 
Coking coal in storage prior to being used in coke batteries may degas and release CH4. The guidance in this 
section does not cover the release of CH4 from gassy coal. Inventory compilers should be aware of the possibility 
of emissions from this source and estimate and report emissions following the guidance in Section 4.1 of this 
chapter. 
Tier 1 
The general form of the equation for estimating emissions for a Tier 1 approach, based on coke production activity, 
is given by Equation 4.3.2 below.

Emission Factor GHG  
= default emission factor for each GHG (kg GHG/tonne of coke produced) 
Tier 2 
In a Tier 2 methodology, inventory compilers can use the amount of coke produced, in combination with country 
specific emission factors for each GHG. 
Tier 3 
There are a range of possible Tier 3 approaches. All methodologies used should be transparently documented. 
In a Tier 3 methodology, inventory compilers can use the amount of coke produced by each plant in combination 
with emission factors, for each GHG, according to coke production processing stage. A Tier 3 approach for one 
or more plants could be combined with lower Tier approaches for other plants to derive a national estimate. 
It is often the case that coverage of plant level data does not correspond exactly to coverage of classifications 
within the national energy statistics, and this can give rise to difficulties in combining the various sources of 
information. Methods for combining data are discussed in Chapter 2 of Volume 1 on General Guidance and 
Reporting. 
Inventory compilers may also use fugitive emission measurement data for one or more of the coke processing 
stages, or, possibly use a model. Ensure that only fugitive emissions are measured, and that combustion or process 
emissions are not included in any measurements. 
If measurements of fugitive emissions are used, it is good practice for inventory compilers to explain the rationale 
behind the emission measurement campaign, how measurements were made, and, if the measurements are 
applicable to individual coke batteries only, or, can be applied more widely to other batteries in the country also. 
Inventory compilers should present supporting information to justify that the measurement results reflect plant 
performance, such as information on the frequency and duration of the measurements and whether the plant was 
operating under normal conditions. Any measurement campaigns should focus on the sources in Table 4.3.4 
associated with the greatest likelihood of emissions. 
Any models used should be verified. Volume 1, Chapter 6 provides guidance on verification approaches that can 
be used.

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The quantities of coke produced may form the input to methods used to estimate fugitive emissions. Coke 
production data is normally available in national energy balance data. Plant specific coke production data may also 
be available. 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
The quantities of coke produced are likely to be well known. Uncertainty estimates of production may be available 
from energy balance data, or, from plant operators. Fugitive emissions of CH4 and N2O will be highly uncertain, 
and, order of magnitude uncertainties on emissions are likely and can be assumed as a first approximation.

FLARING OF COKE OVEN GAS EMISSIONS 
Surplus coke oven gas may be flared if no other economic uses have been found for it, or for operational safety 
reasons and equipment maintenance purposes. Box 4.3.1 provides a summary of flaring activities in metallurgical 
coke and iron and steel production. 
Volume 2: Energy

BOX 4.3.1 (NEW) 
  FLARING ACTIVITIES IN METALLURGICAL COKE AND IRON AND STEEL PRODUCTION 
Gaseous products from metallurgical coke and iron and steel production are mainly used for the 
production of heat and electricity, and in some cases, as reducing agents. A minor proportion of the 
total gas produced, usually less than 5%,  is lost from the production stream and then flared. This 
flaring occurs mainly during emergencies or during maintenance activities. 
Integrated iron and steel facilities usually flare a mix of the gases produced, including coke oven gas 
(COG), blast furnace gas (BFG) and Oxygen Steel Furnace Gas, at the same stacks. This situation 
represents a challenge for the GHGs emissions reporting, because: 
• GHGs emissions from COG flaring should be reported in the energy sector, category 1.B.1.c.ii. 
• GHGs emissions from BFG and Oxygen Steel Furnace Gas flaring should be reported under IPPU. 
In an integrated steelworks if there are flares of combined gases where the estimates for COG, BFG 
and Oxygen Steel Furnace Gas cannot be determined, then it is considered good practice to report 
the emissions in IPPU and seek to minimise the risk of double-counting of emissions reported 
elsewhere in the inventory. To minimise this risk, it is important to consider the methods used for 
estimating emissions from coke ovens and the other emission sources in the integrated works. 
In typical operation of an integrated steelworks, flaring and other losses of COG are minimised due 
to its high energy content. BFG is also generally used but in some cases the percentage flared rate is 
up to 20%. Typically, Oxygen Steel Furnace Gas is totally or partially flared; however, in some 
cases it is directly discharged into the atmosphere. Typical ranges for gas flared rates are: 
 GAS FLARED (%) 
 COKE OVEN GAS (COG) 0.3 TO 2 
 BLAST FURNACE GAS (BFG) 
0.5 TO 20 
 OXYGEN STEEL FURNACE GAS 
5.0 TO 100 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
CHOICE OF METHODS, DECISION TREES, TIERS 
For coke oven gas flaring, there are three tiers than can be used to calculate CO2 emissions and two tiers to calculate 
CH4 and N2O emissions. 
The decision tree in Figure 4.3.4 will help select the Tier to use to estimate CO2 emissions.  To select the Tier for 
CH4 and N2O, use the decision tree in Figure 4.3.5. 
When estimating the emissions of CO2 from flaring of coke oven gas, it is important to ensure there is no double 
counting of emissions that might have been made as part of carbon balance calculations made in the iron and steel 
sector.

Box 4.3.1). 
CC coke oven gas 
= Carbon content of coke oven gas (kg of carbon per GJ of coke oven gas) 
A default carbon content for coke oven gas should be used, taken from Table 1.3, Volume 2, Chapter 1, 2006 
IPCC Guidelines, as shown in Table 4.3.7.  For the Tier 1 approach, inventory compilers could assume that the 
range of COG production per unit of coke production is 360-518 Nm3 COG per tonne coke produced (JRC 2013). 
The Tier 2 approach for CO2 requires knowledge of the amount of coke oven gas flared in the country, and the use 
of country specific carbon content of the coke oven gas produced.  If country specific carbon contents for coke 
oven gas are not available, default carbon contents could be used. In this case the methodology is a hybrid between 
Tier 1 and Tier 2, and is not appropriate to use this if flaring of coke oven gas is a key category. 
Tier 3– CO2 
The Tier 3 method requires the collection, compilation and aggregation of facility-specific measured emissions 
data. It is good practice for inventory compilers to explain the rationale behind the emission measurement 
campaign and how measurements were made. If monitoring data are not available, the Tier 3 method can be 
estimated by applying Equation 4.3.3, based on facility-specific data of coke oven gas flared and coke oven gas 
carbon content. The total national emissions will equal the sum of emissions estimated for each facility. 
Tier 1– CH4 and N2O 
The Tier 1 approach for CH4 and N2O from coke oven gas removed from the production stream and then flared is

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTOR 
The default carbon content of COG, and, emission factors of CH4 and N2O from coke oven gas flaring are provided 
in Table 4.3.7 below.  
The CH4 emission factor has been estimated according with the expression indicated in Table 4.3.7, assuming that 
2 percent (by volume) of the coke oven gas produced is removed from the production stream and then flared, 
considering an average coke oven gas composition, and a default efficiency in flaring. 
In flaring waste gases containing nitrogen compounds, N2O is formed either by the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen 
or by the oxidation of nitrogen compounds in the fuel. Considering that the proportion of nitrogen in coke oven 
gas is highly variable, but the range is similar to those of the gases flared in oil and gas operation facilities, for 
Tier 1 approach it is assumed that the rate between CO2 and N2O emissions from flaring of coke oven gas is the 
same that those used to calculate N2O emission factors in, Table 4.2.4g.  With this assumption, N2O emission 
factor has been estimated according with the expression indicated in Table 4.3.7.

The amount and types of COG produced could be obtained from one, or a combination, of the sources in the list 
below: 
• national energy statistics agencies (national energy statistics agencies may collect data on the amount and types 
of COG produced from individual enterprises that produce fuels); 
• reports provided by enterprises to national energy statistics agencies (these reports are most likely to be 
produced by the operators or owners of large plants); 
                                                                                                                                    Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions

• reports provided by enterprises to regulatory agencies (for example, reports produced to demonstrate how 
enterprises are complying with emission control regulations); 
• periodic surveys, by statistical agencies of the types and quantities of COG produced by a sample of enterprises. 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
If direct measurements of COG flared are used, inventory compilers should estimate and report uncertainties 
associated with the measurements. 
Table 4.3.8 provides the uncertainties associated with the COG carbon contents and the emission factors of CH4 
and N2O.

Table 1.3 of Volume 2, Chapter 4, 2006 IPCC Guidelines provides lower (10.3 kg/GJ) and upper (15.0 kg/GJ) default 
carbon contents of COG. This equates to a 95 percent uncertainty range, in percentage terms with respect to the 
default factor, of -12 to +19 (see Box 3.0b, Chapter 3, Volume 1 of the 2019 Refinement). 
COMPLETENESS 
When estimating the emissions of CO2 from flaring of coke oven gas, it is important to ensure there is no double 
counting of the emissions accounted for non-fugitive emissions from coke production, whose methodology is 
described in Chapter 4, Volume 3 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and in Chapter 4 Volume 3 of the 2019 Refinement. 
Care should be taken with any adjustments for COG used in the energy fuel combustion calculations. 
If non-fugitive emissions are estimated using Tier1b approach, it is assumed that all the coke oven gas produced 
is burned on site for energy recovery, and therefore CO2 emissions from flaring are equal to zero. If Tier 2 or Tier 
3 approaches are applied to estimate emissions from non-fugitive sources, double counting is avoided if the 
emissions from flaring are deducted in the carbon balance (see Equation 4.2, Chapter 4, Volume 3 of the 2019 
Refinement). 
4.3.2.2 GASIFICATION TRANSFORMATION PROCESSES 
Gasification transformation processes are related to the transformation of biomass, coal or natural gas into syngas, 
composed of H2, CO, CO2 and CH4, and, then, into a liquid hydrocarbons fuels. These processes are called biomass 
to gaseous (BtG), biomass to liquid (BtL), coal to liquid (CtL) and gas to liquid (GtL).  
The syngas can be used as a fuel to generate electricity through a gas turbine or as a chemical feedstock (Van der 
Drift and Boerrigter, 2006; OECD/IEA, 2007). The liquid fuels production is obtained through the Fischer-Tropsch 
process, where the syngas, after cleaned to remove CO2, CH4, impurities such as sulphur bearing compounds (in 
particular H2S), and heavy metal bearing compounds, is transformed into high-quality fuels like gasoline, diesel 
and aviation fuels.  Figure 4.3.6 shows the process of gasification transformation.

BtG and BtL are still emerging technologies, and there are currently very few large-scale plants worldwide. 
However, considering that they are likely to become more widely adopted, methodologies to estimate the fugitive 
emissions of these processes are provided in Appendix 4A.3 as indicative methodologies. It is important to 
highlight, however, that current data are inconsistent and improved methods and data may be available in the future. 
CtL and GtL fugitive emissions estimation methodologies are provided below. Table 4.3.9 shows GHGs emissions 
from CtL and GtL processes.

Synthetic fuel production Process

CtL 
CO2, CH4, N2O

CO2 
COAL TO LIQUIDS 
Synthesis gas from CtL is generated by feeding coal into a gasification process. This synthesis gas containing a 
mixture of CO, H2, CO2 and CH4 is fed into a gas cleaning process where impurities such as sulphur bearing 
compounds (in particular H2S), and heavy metal bearing compounds are removed from the synthesis gas. After 
cleaning, the synthesis gas composition is adjusted in a process called water-gas shift conversion. Here the ratio 
of H2 to CO is adjusted to produce a synthesis gas which is optimal for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. After water-gas 
shift conversion the modified synthesis gas is fed to the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process where it reacts to 
produce liquid hydrocarbons. A significant fraction of CtL plant CO2 is generated in the gasification process which 
needs to be separated before the syngas is fed into the FT reactor (Mantripragada and Rubin, 2011). Current 
production levels mainly from CtL plants are estimated at over 300,000 Barrels Per Day (BPD) with a conservative 
annual estimate of 120 million tons of CO2 equivalent (Childress, 2008). 
GAS TO LIQUIDS 
Natural gas is combined with steam and pure oxygen from a cryogenic air separation unit before it is heated and 
fed into an autothermal reformer (ATR). Syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO, leaves the ATR and enters the Fischer-
Tropsch (FT) synthesis reactor, where it is converted to a hydrocarbon wax. The wax exiting the FT reactor is 
upgraded in the product work-up unit to yield approximately 70 percent diesel and 30 percent naphtha liquid 
products. A steam-methane reforming hydrogen plant is required to provide hydrogen for the product upgrading 
as well as inlet natural gas pre-treatment.  The GtL plant CO2 is generated from several sources (Heimel & Lowe, 
2009): 
• Entering with the inlet natural gas (feed gas assumed to contain 1.6 mol percent CO2); 
• Forming during syngas generation; 
• Forming in the FT reactor; 
• Forming in the hydrogen plant; 
• Forming in the process heating furnaces.

All these sources are considered in the quantification of fugitive CO2 emissions from a GtL plant. GtL technology 
in particular as alternative to petroleum based diesel is considered to be one of the less carbon-intensive technical 
options to reduce petroleum consumption in the on-road transportation sector (Hao et al, 2010). The worldwide 
syngas database produced by the Gasification and Syngas Technologies Council (GSTC) shows that there are more 
than thirty (30) projects that are either in operation or under development (GSTC, 2014). Hao et al estimated GtL 
capacity to be 35,000 BPD in the year 2010 and projected an increase in capacity to 1-2 million BPD by 2015 
(Hao et al, 2008). 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
The choice of method will depend on the technologies that are operational in countries, including whether the 
technologies analysed in this section are key categories in the country, and to what extent country and plant-
specific information is available or can be gathered. 
The most accurate estimates for fugitive emissions, can be developed by determining the emissions on a plant-by-
plant basis and/or differentiated for each feedstock category (e.g., type of biomass, coal or gas). The methods for 
estimating CO2, CH4 and N2O fugitive emissions from these technologies vary because of the different factors that 
influence emission levels. N2O emissions from coal gasification are negligible and depends on the nitrogen content 
of the coal. 
The general approach to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from those technologies is to obtain the amount of 
feedstock used and to investigate the related greenhouse gas emission factors, preferably from country-specific 
information on the carbon content. In the case of CtL, the resultant syngas produced from gasification of coal is 
used as activity data. 
CHOICE OF METHODS, DECISION TREES, TIERS 
There is limited information about gasification transformation technologies and, therefore, it was considered that 
fugitive emissions occur only at the gasification stage. The fugitive emissions resulting from the syngas 
transformation at the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) stage was considered negligible, as most emissions at FT stage are 
related to combustion processes to produce heat. 
The method for estimating fugitive emissions from GtL technologies is based on an estimate of the carbon content 
in the feedstock used and converting the product to greenhouse gases emissions. The activity data are the feedstock 
inputs into the gasification stage, and the emission factors are based on the carbon content of the feedstock. 
The CtL process produces the bulk volume of greenhouse gas emissions during the production and treatment of 
syngas.  This, the method for estimating fugitive emissions from CtL technologies is based on the amounts of 
syngas produced in terajoules.  
The choice of method depends on the country specific information available, and is given in the decision tree in 
Figure 4.3.7.

Tier 1 
The Tier 1 method is a simple method that can be used when fugitive emissions from CtL and GtL technologies 
are not significant. 
Fugitive emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O can be estimated from the amount of syngas (CtL) or natural gas (GtL) 
and the emission factor of fugitive emission. The application of a Tier1 approach is done using Equation 4.3.5 
presented below.

Tier 2 
CtL and GtL plants are versatile and depending on their process unit arrangement downstream, they are able to 
produce a wide range of products. Some CtL/GtL plants are able to produce a combination of liquid fuels and 
chemicals (e.g. Ammonia (NH3), Nitric Acid (HNO3), methanol (CH3OH), etc.). This in turn affects the rate at 
which syngas is produced upstream. The quality of coal used determines the quality of syngas and the effort needed 
to treat syngas. Hence, it is good practice to develop a Tier 2 emission factor based on plant-specific emission 
factors as opposed to country-specific emission factors that are developed by aggregating plant-level emission 
factors for a country in question. 
Tier 3 
The most appropriate Tier 3 approach is a material balance methodology. This is largely because, the CtL process 
in particular is a very versatile process. Depending on the type and volume of downstream products (chemicals or 
liquid fuels), the amount of syngas to be processed via the Fischer-Tropsch process can be varied. That in turn, 
affects the amount of syngas that needs to be produced upstream. Variation in the production of syngas affects the 
amount of Greenhouse Gas emissions released in the atmosphere. Secondly, the syngas production and treatment 
processes release a large volume of flue gas stream that is almost impossible to measure. Hence, a direct 
measurement methodology is not ideal for CtL and GtL processes. Preferable a Tier 3 stoichiometric/mass-balance 
methodology should be followed. 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTOR 
Coal to liquids 
Higman and van der Burgt (2008) presents process-specific CO2, CH4 and N2O emission factors as a function of 
syngas production and by process type. It is worth noting that for the CtL process, the bulk volume of greenhouse 
gas emissions are released during the production and treatment of syngas. Table 4.3.10 presents emission factors 
reported by Higman and van der Burgt. These emission factors have been developed for typical current 
international values and ranges of coal qualities (20.7 -27.3 kJ/kg HHV). Coal Gasification systems considered 
are the Air Separation Unit (ASU), Oxygen blown fixed-bed BGL 1000 gasifier, acid gas removal (Rectisol).

Gas to liquids 
Jaramillo et al. analysed CO2 emissions released during syngas production in CtL and GtL plants (Jaramillo et al, 
2008). The study by Jaramillo et al (2008) assumes that slightly more diesel is produced than gasoline. This 
assumption is plausible given that a conventional GtL plant produces 62 percent Diesel, 44 percent gasoline and 3 
percent propane (Jaramillo et al, 2008). The CO2 emission factor is therefore derived from the inputs and outputs 
of a conventional GtL plant by dividing the amount of carbon lost (assuming 100 percent oxidation) with the 
volume of natural gas input to produce syngas. CO2 is the most dominant GHG in the GtL process and therefore, 
it is a conservative approach to assume that 100 percent of carbon lost to the atmosphere is CO2. Table 4.3.11 
presents CO2 emission factors of GtL gasification process.

CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Coal to liquids 
The activity data required for a Tiers 1 and 2 are the amounts of syngas produced in terajoules (TJ). Since this data 
is monitored continuously at individual plant level, it is good practice to collect syngas production data from each 
plant. 
For the Tier 3 method, carbon mass flow and species composition data is required to accurately quantify the amount 
of GHGs in the flue gas streams. Even though the amount of syngas produced is not necessary as activity data for 
a Tier 3 method, it is good practice to collect and report these data in comparing the results of the Tier 3 method 
(material balance) against the Tier 1 method. 
Gas to liquids 
The activity data required for Tiers 1 and 2 is the amounts of natural gas inputs into the GtL process in terajoules 
(TJ). Natural gas may be used upstream of the GtL plant for heat and electricity production during production. 
Therefore, it is good practice to ensure that the amount of natural gas used for electricity and heat during natural 
gas production is separated from the amount of natural gas used as a feedstock in the GtL plant. Inventory 
compilers have to use default density at standard temperature and pressure for natural gas to convert the amount 
of natural gas inputs from volumetric basis to mass basis. 
For a Tier 3 method, carbon flows and species composition are required to quantify the amount of carbon in each 
process stream and process unit inside a GtL plant. This information is monitored continuously during process 
control and therefore should be readily available from each plant. 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Gasification Transformation Processes 
Estimates of fugitive emissions from gasification transformation processes can be highly uncertain due to lack of 
information about these technologies. More research and development is needed on these technologies, especially 
direct measurement on all stages to confirm which ones present fugitive emissions. 
 
                                                                                                                                    Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions  
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4.123 
Activity data uncertainties 
The quantities of feedstocks used (e.g. in the cased of GtL or biomass) or syngas produced (e.g. in the case of CtL) 
are likely to be well known. Uncertainty estimates of production may be available from energy balance data, or, 
from plant operators. Fugitive emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O will be highly uncertain, and, order of magnitude 
uncertainties on emissions are likely and can be assumed as a first approximation. 
Emission factor uncertainties 
Considering the minimal literature and the absence of large scale fuel transformation processes, fugitive emission 
factors provided in these guidelines were estimated based on a very few data, resulting in a high level of 
uncertainty. Table 4.3.12 provides the uncertainties associated with the emission factors of CO2, CH4 and N2O.

4.3.3 
Completeness 
This section of the GLs is currently not able to provide a set of methods to estimate fugitive emissions from all the 
possible parts of each of the sources. But it is good practice for inventory compliers to ensure completeness and 
to try and estimate emissions if possible. But resources should be prioritised according to the key category analysis 
results. 
Where a country has estimated its fugitive emissions based on an aggregation of estimates reported by individual 
plants, it is good practice to document the steps taken to ensure that these results are complete, transparent and 
consistent across the time series. Corrections made to account for companies or facilities that did not report, and 
measures taken to avoid missed or double counting (particularly where ownership changes have occurred) and to 
assess uncertainties should be highlighted. Care should be taken to ensure that CO2 emissions from coal combusted 
for production of syngas are counted separately from CO2 emissions arising from syngas production through coal 
gasification. Production of town gas is also considered a gasification process. Town gas originates from outgassing 
of hard coal under air exclusion in retort furnace or chamber kilns. A methodology for this source is not currently 
available. If a method should become available, emissions from these processes could be reported under 1.B.1.c.iv 
Gasification Transformation. 
4.3.4 
Developing consistent time series 
Ideally, emission estimates will be prepared for the base year and subsequent years using the same method. The 
aim is to have emission estimates across the time series reflect true trends in greenhouse gas emissions. Emission 
or control factors that change over time (e.g., due to changes in source demographics or the penetration of control 
technologies) should be regularly updated and, each time, only applied to the period for which they are valid. For, 
example, if an emission control device is retrofit to a source then a new emission factor will apply to that source 
from then onwards; however, the previously applied emission factor reflecting conditions before the retrofit should 
still be applied for all previous years in the time series. If an emission factor has been refined through further 
testing and now reflects a better understanding of the source or source category, then all previous estimates should 
be updated to reflect the use of the improved factor and be reported in a transparent manner. 
A country should assess which technologies and practices are generally in place in the country and apply the 
corresponding emission factor.  As technologies and practices change over time, it is possible that a country will 
use one EF in some years and another in other years.  A compiler should assess the time frame over which changes 
took place, and consider linear interpolation or other techniques to incorporate the trend from one emission factor 
to another over the time series. 
Where some historical data are missing, it might still be possible to use source-specific measurement results 
combined with back-casting techniques to establish an acceptable relationship between emissions and activity data 
Volume 2: Energy 
4.124 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
in the base year. Approaches for doing this will depend on the specific situation, and are discussed in general terms 
in Volume 1 Chapter 5 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
If emission estimates are developed based on an aggregation of individual company estimates, greater effort will 
be required to maintain time series consistency, particularly where frequent facility ownership changes occur and 
different methodologies and emission factors are applied by each new owner without also carrying these changes 
back through the time series. 
4.3.5 
Inventory Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
(QA/QC) 
Specific QA/QC procedures to optimise the quality of estimates of emissions are given in Chapter 6 of Volume 1, 
General Guidance and Reporting. 
The bullet point list below identifies good practice in estimating fugitive emissions from the sources included in 
this section of the guidance: 
• Charcoal and biochar production: it is good practice to ensure that emissions from charcoal and biochar 
production are based on activity data that are mass- or energy-based measurements of charcoal and biochar 
produced. Note that in many countries it is common practice to report the production of these products based 
on the number of bags of fuel produced, so these data will need to be converted to fuel mass estimates. 
• Coke production: it is good practice to to conduct checks on the total reported fugitive emissions from coke 
production against emissions from other source categories in the iron and steel sector. Fugitive emissions are 
typically only a very small fraction of the total emissions in the iron steel sector. 
• For fugitive emissions from CtL and GtL, it is good practice to ensure that the quantity of feedstocks used (e.g. 
natural gas for GtL and coal used to produce syngas in the case of CtL) is comparable to the amount of natural 
gas and coal reported as feedstock for these fuel transformation industries which is subtracted in the reference 
approach for CO2 under stationary combustion. 
• Biomass to liquids and biomass to gas: it is good practice to consult with industrial operators to confirm the 
scope and origin of fugitive emissions, i.e. to confirm at which stage(s) of the transformation processes that 
fugitive emissions arise, and to document the findings in the annual submission.  
4.3.6 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates, as outlined in Volume 1 Chapter 8 of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. 
It may not be practical to include all supporting documentation in the inventory report. However, at a minimum, 
the inventory report should include summaries of the methods used and references to source data such that the 
reported emissions estimates are transparent and the steps in their calculation may be retraced. For segments where 
a technology- or practice-specific Tier 1 emission factor is used, the rationale for selecting that factor and the 
method for applying the factors over the time series must be clearly documented. It is expected that many countries 
will use a combination of methodological tiers to evaluate the amount of fugitive greenhouse gas emissions. The 
specific choices should reflect the relative importance of the different subcategories and the availability of the data 
and resources needed to support the corresponding calculations. 
Recalculations should be clearly documented, explaining changes that have been made to emission factors, or 
methodologies. The steps taken to ensure time series consistency should be documented. 
The above reporting and documentation guidance is applicable to all methodological choices. Where Tier 3 
approaches are employed, it is important to ensure that either the applied procedures are detailed in the inventory 
report or that available references for these procedures are cited since the IPCC Guidelines do not describe a 
standard Tier 3 approach. 
                                                                                                                                    Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions

Standard Conditions 
Standard conditions 
The Tier 1 EFs listed in the Tables 4.2.4 – 4.2.4k are sensitive to temperature and pressure. Activity data must be 
consistent with the EFs standard conditions. The EFs are given at the most commonly used standard conditions: 
15°С and 101.325 kPa (1 atm). If activity data are derived at reference conditions, which are different from those 
used by the Tier 1 EFs, the inventory compiler should harmonize activity data with 15°С and 101.325 kPa. Pressure 
is normally fixed for most of the standard conditions at the level of 101.325 kPa (1 atm). Thus, in general, probable 
variations of reference temperature should be considered as a priority. 
Along with the physical state, activity data can be split into liquids (oil) and gases (natural gas and associated 
petroleum gas). Different correction approaches of gases and liquids are required. 
Liquids (oil) 
Liquids may be referenced at 20°C and 15°C. In order to harmonize oil units referenced at 20°C to the Tier 1 EFs, 
correction can be made with the use of international standard tables of conversion factors (CFs) and densities based 
on detailed data on oil properties. Standard tables can be found in internationally recognized sources as follows:

11 - Physical Properties Data Section 1 - Temperature and Pressure Volume Correction Factors for

As follows from the standard, the correction approach is based on the equations listed below (Equations 4A.1.1 to

Annex 4A.2 
Disaggregation of Tier 1 factors presented in 
Section 4.2.2.3 
This Annex presents the percent of emissions that are leaked, vented, and flared in the data sets used for the Tier 
1 emission factors. To disaggregate the aggregate Tier 1 EF in the 2019 Refinements into emissions “leaked,” 
“vented,” and “flared,” apply the percent below to the corresponding aggregated value presented in Section 4.2. 
For an example of this calculation, see Box 4A.2.1 below.  
The disaggregation was developed by reviewing the underlying data sets for the emission factors, assigning 
emission sources to leaked (e.g., emissions leaked from a pipeline), vented (e.g., emissions from venting for liquids 
unloading), and flared (e.g., emissions from flaring at well completions) emissions, and calculating the percent of 
total emissions in each category of leak, vent, and flare. Note likely that the fraction of emissions in each category 
may vary considerably from country to country and over time.

EXAMPLE OF CALCULATION OF DISAGGREGATED EMISSION ESTIMATES FOR OIL PRODUCTION 
Oil production in Country A occurs entirely onshore. The compiler has assessed available data on 
technologies and practices and determined that the most appropriate factor is the one for “most 
activities are occurring with higher-emitting technologies and practices” (i.e., the compiler either 
does not have information to assess that low-emitting technologies are prevalent, or has assessed 
that more than 5 percent of associated gas is vented, or more than 30 percent of tank throughput is 
uncontrolled (e.g. without flaring or VRUs), and that the best available activity data is active onshore 
oil well counts. In year 2017, country A had 100,000 active onshore oil wells. The table below 
demonstrates how Country A would use a Tier 1 approach to calculate total emissions for oil 
production in 2017, and disaggregated emissions for oil production in 2017.

Annex 4A.3 
Definition of terminologies used in Section 4.2 
abandoned well: a well no-longer in production or being actively explored; such wells may be unplugged or 
plugged. Wells plugged according to regulations and abandoned are also known as decommissioned wells. Wells 
that are not regularly inspected or repaired and remain unplugged are abandoned but not decommissioned. 
acid gas: gas that, when mixed with water, forms an acidic solution (e.g. hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and carbon 
dioxide (CO2) - both obtained after sweeting sour gas); see also sour gas. 
API: the American Petroleum Institute, the primary trade association representing the oil and natural gas industry 
in the United Status.  
API gravity: gravity scale developed by the American Petroleum Institute that expresses the relative density of 
petroleum liquids as API degrees; most values fall between 10 and 70 degrees API gravity, and the lower the API 
gravity, the higher the density of a hydrocarbon. 
appliance: see gas appliance. 
asphalt: solid or nearly solid bitumen with impurities (nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur) that can melt upon heating; 
forms when light components or volatiles of petroleum have been removed or evaporated; see also bitumen. 
associated petroleum gas (APG): gas produced along with oil.  
bitumen: typically solid hydrocarbon with high density (API < 10 degrees; e.g. asphalt); see also asphalt. 
blow-down: venting for safety precautions during maintenance, or emergency or upset conditions, occurring 
across segments, and including vented condensate and gas produced simultaneously at the outset of production or 
when re-starting a well that has been shut down for a period of time, maintenance venting at a processing plant, or 
pipeline venting 
blow out: when well pressure exceeds the wellhead valves’ ability to control it and oil and gas are released at the 
surface; uncontrolled, possibly catastrophic, flow of reservoir fluids into wellbore that may consist of salt water, 
oil, gas, or a mixture thereof. 
bore hole: the hole drilled by the drill bit; the wellbore including open hole or uncased portion of the well. 
cap rock: relatively impermeable rock (e.g. shale, anhydrite, salt) that forms a seal above a reservoir rock and 
prevents fluids from migrating out of the reservoir. 
carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS): a process in which a relatively pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
from industrial and energy-related sources is separated (captured), conditioned, compressed, and transported to a 
storage location for long-term isolation from the atmosphere. 
CO2 injection: an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method whereby CO2 gas is injected into a reservoir to reduce 
viscosity and increase production. 
carbon intensity: average emission rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) from a source per unit of activity (e.g. g CO2 per 
MJ of energy produced). 
casing: cement pipe lowered down a borehole meant to prevent fluids from escaping and/or the borehole from 
collapsing. 
Casing head: the adapter between the first casing and the wellhead. 
centrifugal compressor: centrifugal compressors are widely used in production, processing, and transmission of 
natural gas. Seals on the rotating shafts prevent the high-pressure natural gas from escaping the compressor casing. 
Traditionally, these seals, termed “wet” seals, used high pressure oil as a barrier against escaping gas. An 
alternative to the traditional wet (oil) seal system is the mechanical dry seal system. This seal system does not use 
any circulating seal oil. Dry seals operate mechanically under the opposing force created by hydrodynamic grooves 
and static pressure. Replacing “wet” (oil) seals with dry seals significantly reduces operating costs and methane 
emissions (United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2016b).   
chemical flooding:  a type of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that utilizes alkaline or micellar-polymer flooding. 
coal bed methane (CBM): natural gas (methane/CH4, mainly) generated during coal formation and absorbed in 
coal. Originally extracted as a safety measure to reduce explosion hazards in mines, today CBM is captured and 
used as a source of energy.  For deeper coal formations, hydraulic fracturing may be needed to release the natural 
gas (https://www.epa.gov/uog/process-unconventional-natural-gas-production). 
completion: process of initiating flow of petroleum or natural gas from a newly drilled well prior to production 
(a) For conventional well completion a reservoir is connected to the wellbore during this process, allowing the 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
4.138 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
flowback of drilling and reservoir fluids (gas, oil, water, mud, etc.) to the surface. While there is flowback, there 
may be flaring or venting of produced gas from the reservoir. (b) For unconventional well completions, if hydraulic 
fracturing is employed, there may be a higher rate of flowback of water, fracking fluids, reservoir gas and fracturing 
proppant (e.g. sand) that can release greater amounts of methane and hydrocarbons to the atmosphere when 
compared to conventional well completions. (c) In a green completion or reduced emissions completion (REC), 
produced gas following hydraulic fracturing is captured, offsetting the loss of methane and other hydrocarbons 
during flowback from the well completion. 
compressor: a device that raises pressure of air or natural gas so the gas can flow into pipelines or other facilities; 
see also centrifugal compressor and reciprocating compressor. 
compressor station: facility with many compressors, auxiliary treatment equipment, and pipeline installations to 
pump natural gas under pressure over long distances. 
condensate: a low-density, high API (50-120 degrees) hydrocarbon associated with natural gas that is in the gas 
phase under reservoir conditions (temperature, pressure) but becomes liquid when the reservoir, pipeline, or 
surface facility pressure drops below the dew point. It is mainly composed of propane, butane pentane and heavier 
hydrocarbon fractions. 
conservation efficiency (CE): a factor that expresses the amount of produced gas and vapour captured and used 
for fuel, produced into gas gathering systems, or re-injected (1.0 = all gas is conserved, utilized or re-injected; 0 = 
gas is vented or flared). 
conventional oil: oil produced from a conventional reservoir 
conventional reservoir:  a reservoir where buoyant forces maintain hydrocarbons beneath a sealing cap stone and 
whose properties usually allow oil or natural gas to flow readily into well bores; this is distinct from shale or 
unconventional reservoirs, where gas may be distributed throughout the reservoir at basin scale and where 
additional buoyant forces or the influence of a water column is not significant. 
crude oil: liquid petroleum as it arises from the ground, distinguished from refined oils that are manufactured from 
it. 
cyclic steam stimulation (CSS): a method of in situ oil sand extraction that uses steam to heat the reservoir, 
allowing bitumen to flow into a vertical or horizontal wellbore; see also steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). 
decommissioned well: an abandoned well no longer in production that has been isolated according to current 
regulatory requirements and best practices (e.g. cut-off, sealed, and possibly buried); such wells may still 
deteriorate over time, and may require inspection and repair when necessary, though the regulatory requirements 
to do so may vary considerably. 
directional drilling: the intentional deviation of a well bore from the path it would have naturally taken by using 
specialized, steerable drilling equipment; commonly used in shale reservoirs to allow producers to place the 
borehole in contact with the most productive reservoir rock. 
distribution: for oil systems, the segment of the system that includes the transport and distribution of refined 
products, including bulk and retail facilities; for natural gas systems, this segment includes high-pressure gas 
pipelines that transfer natural gas to the “city gate” and then to end users through underground main and service 
pipelines, distribution of town gas, and short term surface storage. 
emission control device: a device used to regulate the amount of gasses or air pollutants emitted from a source. 
Emissions Trading System (ETS): a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the European Union plus 
Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. 
enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM):  increased methane (CH4) recovery produced by the injection of CO2 into 
coal seams. 
enhanced gas recovery (EGR): increased recovery of natural gas by injection of inert gases (e.g. N2, CO2) to 
increase well pressure. 
enhanced oil recovery (EOR):  recovery of oil from a reservoir by means other than using the natural reservoir 
pressure; can begin after a secondary recovery process or at any time during the productive life of an oil reservoir; 
an oil recovery enhancement method that uses sophisticated techniques that restores formation pressure and 
improves oil displacement or fluid flow in a reservoir; there are three major types: chemical flooding (alkaline 
flooding or micellar-polymer flooding), miscible displacement (CO2 injection or hydrocarbon injection) and 
thermal recovery (steam flood or in situ combustion).  
exploration: the part of oil and natural gas systems that includes well drilling, stem testing, and well completion; 
the process of trying to find accumulations of oil and natural gas under the surface of the Earth. 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions

4.139 
flaring destruction efficiency (FE): the fraction of gas that leaves the flare partially or fully burned. 
flow-back: gas, crude oil and water (including water injected during hydraulic fracturing) that are produced from 
a well until the flow of gas and liquid hydrocarbon is steady; occurs after a treatment or in preparation for  returning 
a well to production. 
formation carbon dioxide: CO2 present in the produced oil and gas when it leaves the reservoir. 
gas appliances: end of pipe equipment such as home heating equipment, water heaters, saunas, stoves, and 
barbecues that use natural gas. 
gathering system: the network of flow lines and process facilities that transport and control the flow of oil or gas 
from wells to a main storage facility, processing plant, or shipping point (includes pumps, headers, separators, 
emulsion treaters, tanks, regulators, compressors, dehydrators, valves). 
gas injection: the process of pumping associated gas into a reservoir for conservation or to maintain reservoir 
pressure. 
gas-to-oil ratio (GOR): volume of gas at atmospheric pressure produced per unit of oil produced. 
gas well: a well with natural gas as the primary product, but can also produce natural gas liquids (e.g. propane and 
butane) and water. 
gross calorific value (GCV): conversion factor to convert a fuel quantity between natural units (e.g. mass or 
volume) 
and

(IEA; 
https://www.iea.org/media/training/alumni/CheatSheet.pdf). 
hydraulic fracturing: a method of enhanced oil or gas recovery in which fluids are pumped into a rock formation 
at very high pressures in order to fracture the rock and stimulate the flow of natural gas or oil, increasing the 
volumes that can be recovered. Wells may be drilled vertically hundreds to thousands of feet below the surface 
and may include horizontal or directional sections extending thousands of feet away from the well. 
hydrogen sulphide (H2S): a poisonous gas present in some subsurface formations. 
in situ combustion: a method of thermal recovery where fire, generated inside a reservoir by injecting oxygen/air, 
burns heavy hydrocarbons and vaporizes lighter hydrocarbons, pushing out hot combustion gases, steam and oil 
water while also reducing oil viscosity. 
leak: unintentional (i.e., not vented or flared) emissions from equipment components such as valves, connectors, 
open ended lines, and flanges; can occur in all segments of oil and natural gas systems. 
leak detection and repair (LDAR): determination of a leak in a pipeline or piece of equipment using various 
detection methods followed by repair. 
light hydrocarbons:  low molecular weight hydrocarbons (e.g. methane, ethane, butane) 
liquid hydrocarbons:  light liquid compounds extracted from gas flow stream (e.g. propane, butane, pentane 
liquids unloading: see unloading 
liquefied natural gas (LNG): oilfield or naturally occurring gas (mostly methane and ethane), liquefied at 
cryogenic temperatures for transportation. 
methane (CH4): the lightest and most abundant hydrocarbon gas and main component of natural gas.  
miscible displacement: a type of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that uses CO2 injection or hydrocarbon injection. 
natural gas: a gas that occurs naturally and often in association with crude petroleum; a mixture of hydrocarbon 
gases that is highly compressible and expansible (consists primarily of methane, but also ethane, propane, butane, 
and pentane; impurities such as CO2, He, N, and H2S may also be present). 
natural gas liquids (NGLs): liquid natural gas components including condensate (low vapor pressure NGL), 
natural gasoline (intermediate vapor pressure NGL), and liquified petroleum gas (high vapor pressure NGL).  
NGLs include: propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane but NOT methane and ethane.

Appendix 4A.1 
Fugitive emissions from mining, processing, 
storage and transportation of coal: Basis for Future 
Methodological Development 
Based on the current state of research and data availability, methodologies for estimating emissions from 
abandoned surface mining and from coal exploration have not yet been able to be developed. However, general 
methodological issues for abandoned surface mine emissions, and a more detailed draft of elements of a 
methodology for coal exploration are below for countries to consider as a basis for future methodological 
development. 
Appendix 4A.1.1 Abandoned Surface Mines 
Closed, or abandoned, surface coal mines may continue to be a source of greenhouse gas emissions for some time 
after the mines have been closed or decommissioned. For the purpose of the emissions inventory compilation, a 
first critical step is to ensure that each mine is classified in one and only one inventory database (e.g., active or 
abandoned).  
It is also important to consider sub-category allocation issues - to separate any emissions from abandoned surface 
mines from those of uncontrolled combustion and burning of coal deposits, to avoid double counting. CO2 
emissions can arise from both low-temperature oxidation of exposed coal-bearing rocks and uncontrolled 
combustion. The CO2 emissions from uncontrolled combustion should be reported under 1.B.1.b Uncontrolled 
Combustion, and Burning Coal Dumps. 
Countries considering activity data for estimating emissions from abandoned surface mines may take into account 
factors such as the surface area of exposure coal, the degree of flooding and the extent and type of mine 
rehabilitation that has taken place. 
For CO2 and CH4 emission factors, consideration may be given to the type of coal mined, eg bituminous, 
subbituminous, lignite etc., mine site management practices and how the emission factors are likely to change over 
time since mine closure.  
In general, more work needs to take place in order to build a basis for robust and representative Tier 1 methodology 
development. This is particularly the case for developing appropriate emission factors, as well as understanding 
the variability and uncertainty associated with emissions from this source. 
Appendix 4A.1.2 Coal Exploration 
A large fraction of the gas contained in coal seams is adsorbed on the coal surface inside the micropores and a 
small fraction in the free state in the macro pores and cleats. The hydrostatic pressure that a coal seam is subjected 
to prevents desorption of the gas from the coal matrix. Gas flow from exploration boreholes is not comparable to 
the flow of gas in coalbed methane wells where the coal seams are stimulated by hydro fracturing and 
depressurized by dewatering the coal seams. Emissions during exploratory borehole drilling may be largely 
associated with the amount of coal or lignite added to the national resource (found as a result of exploration) during 
the reporting period. This addition of resource is termed as augmentation of resource during the period. 
4A.1.2.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
Fugitive methane emissions from exploration boreholes in a coalfield depend on the gas content, cumulative 
thickness of the coal seams encountered during exploratory drilling, as well as stratigraphy, structure and nature 
of coal and associated sediments. A variety of geological and geophysical techniques such as generating a 
geological map of the area, carrying out geochemical and geophysical surveys, drilling of exploration boreholes 
with or without coring, down-hole geophysical logging and comprehensive analysis and testing of core samples 
are used to estimate the coal resources. While drilling for coal exploration programs involve core and/or non-core 
drilling, core drilling is the only satisfactory means of obtaining representative samples (Ward, 2009), either of 
coal seams for thickness and quality assessment or of non-coal rocks for geotechnical tests. Emissions from coal 
exploration covered here include those fugitive emissions from the drilling of exploration boreholes. 
Emission of methane from exploratory boreholes directly depends on number of exploration boreholes drilled in 
a reporting period. When considering a borehole-specific approach, there is a need to ensure the source boundary 
distinction between boreholes that are drilled as part of coal mine production (which are already included as part 
of Underground and Surface coal mining activities) and those drilled for coal exploration to avoid double counting. 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
4.144 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Field level desorption tests are carried out during exploratory drilling of some selected boreholes and important 
CBM related data such as in situ gas content, sorption time etc. are generated (CMPDI, 2016). Gas desorption 
curves are also prepared. Often adsorption isotherm curves are also constructed. National emission factors can be 
evaluated using the measured data in and mathematical models for gas flow rates from a well without any 
stimulation. The emission factors so evaluated can be used for estimation of emission from every borehole drilled 
in a coal block. Therefore, substantial research and development opportunities should be explored to find number 
of exploratory boreholes drilled in a reporting period which may be obtained from geological reports on coal 
exploration for numerous coal blocks. Emission factors may also be calculated for each of the blocks. Estimates 
of fugitive methane emission should then be prepared with a high degree of accuracy. Nevertheless, exploration 
involves many agencies in a country and geological reports on exploration are not usually readily available in 
exploration reports or any other publication.  
Because activity data that more directly relate to emissions from coal exploration are often unavailable, the method 
presented here relies on year-to-year differences between annual national inventories of coal and lignite resources 
(augmentation of coal resources).  Emissions based on this parameter solely may not be representative.. Annual 
updating of the national quantity of coal and lignite resources is an integral part of exploration often used to update 
the national quantity of coal and lignite resources. Annual national inventories of coal and lignite resources are 
often prepared by a single ministry or nodal agency of the country. Therefore, augmentation of coal resources 
(GSI, 2017) in a reporting year over that of the preceding year can be easily obtained or calculated by subtracting 
the resources of the current year from that of the preceding year. This annual change or augmentation may be used 
as activity data for exploration boreholes if number of boreholes drilled in a reporting period is not available. It is 
recognized that resources are categorized by various agencies into different sub-classes based on their technical 
and economic levels of recoverability, making it difficult to develop one definition of “coal resources” that is 
broadly applicable. However, drilling of exploration boreholes and other exploratory activities is necessary for 
determining the total coal resources, regardless of their categorization. 
While the required coal data is often available on a yearly basis for major coal producing countries, annual data 
on “resource augmentation” may not be available or may be available on a decade by decade basis in the national 
statistics. Global statistical publications like BP Statistical Review of World Energy may be referred to in such 
circumstances. 
The augmentation of coal resources is the additional resource of coal and lignite found as a result of exploration 
during a reporting year which, when added to the previous year’s resource, gives current resource. The entire 
augmented resources are not the sources of greenhouse gas emission but they indirectly represent the number of 
coal exploration boreholes since the exploratory drilling is usually carried at known interval over coal bearing 
areas for assessment of coal potentiality. The spacing of the boreholes depends on geological structure, deposit 
character, nature of data required for mine planners etc. Although seismic exploration technology is very important 
for petroleum exploration, it is seldom used in exploration of solid minerals such as coal due to technological and 
economic limitations (National Research Council 2002). Instead, drilling of exploratory boreholes that yields a 
plethora of information on coal characteristics and resources is very common for exploration of coal.

Where units are:

CH4 Emission Factor (m3 tonne-1) 
Augmentation of Resource (tonne year-1) 
All different categories of coal resources such as measured (or proved), indicated and inferred etc. (UNFC 2009), 
should be taken into account for determining activity data of augmented resource. Care should be taken if there is 
a reduction in the coal resource quantity in a reporting period in which case the method may produce a negative 
emission in that year. This should be treated as an undesirable outcome and unusual observation for which Tier 1 
method should not be used. In such a situation, emission should be regarded as zero emission instead be negative 
emission. 
Tier 2 – Basin-Specific Approach 
The Tier 2 approach for preparing a methane emission inventory from coal exploration boreholes is similar to the 
Tier 1 method, but basin-specific borehole data are taken into consideration in a Tier 2 method. Coal basin-specific 
data on methane emission from exploratory boreholes in a basin or coalfield should be collected. The average 
value of such measured emissions from some boreholes, if available, should be considered as emission factor for 
the basin under consideration. The emission factor so evaluated should be multiplied by number of boreholes 
drilled in the basin under consideration to arrive at the emission from the basin. Similarly, methane emission from 
other basins should also be estimated. Tier 1 method should be adopted for those basins where no measurement 
has been done from any exploratory borehole. Summation of the emission values from each of the basins gives the 
emission estimate from exploratory boreholes for the country.  
For a Tier 2 approach the exploration borehole emission estimation method is shown below:

Tier 3 – Borehole Specific Approach 
Coal exploration companies often determine in situ gas content and other gas desorption characteristics such as 
sorption time of coal seams encountered during exploratory drilling of boreholes, Langmuir volume, Langmuir 
pressure and permeability. Release of gas from a coal seam is highly dependent on these parameters. Models are 
also available to calculate emissions if the gas desorption parameters are available. The impact of management 
actions such as borehole capping etc. should be taken into consideration. A Tier 3 approach can be developed if 
gas desorption parameters are available. When considering a borehole-specific approach, there is a need to ensure 
the source boundary distinction between boreholes that are drilled as part of coal mine production (which are 
already included as part of Underground and Surface coal mining activities) and those drilled for coal exploration 
to avoid double counting.

4A.1.2.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
No information is found in the literature on measurement of fugitive methane emission specifically from coal 
exploration boreholes. Therefore emission factors provided below are as per expert opinion. Since the exploration 
boreholes are filled with water or mud, the hydrostatic pressure on the coal seams encountered will be significant. 
Accordingly, emission factors for exploration boreholes are assumed to be small compared to those of other coal 
mining activities. 
Tier 1 – Global Average Approach – Fugitive Emission from Coal Exploration 
Boreholes 
Default emission factors for different depth ranges given below and activity data on augmented resource in the 
respective depth range should be used for calculation of emission estimates using Equation 4Ap.1.1. It should be 
noted that the entire resource shall not emit methane but only a fraction of it will release the gas. Therefore, 
emission factors for exploration boreholes are very less in comparison to the emission factors for underground 
mining and post mining activities prescribed in Equations 4.1.3 and 4.1.4. This will correspond to emission from 
coal very closed to the well bore. 
CH4 Emission Factor 
= 0.01 m3 tonne-1 for depth range 0 – 600 m 
CH4 Emission Factor 
= 0.03 m3 tonne-1 for depth range 600 – 1200 m 
CH4 Emission Factor 
= 0.05 m3 tonne-1 for depth > 1200 m 
Conversion Factor: 
This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67●10-6 Gg m-3. 
The basis of arriving at the above emission factors is expert judgment since information on fugitive methane 
emission from coal exploration boreholes is not usually readily available. It is well known that in situ gas content 
of coal seams increases with depth. Therefore, deeper coal horizons are likely to emit at higher rates. Hence, 
emission factor will be higher for deeper seams. Further, exploration boreholes are filled with water or mud which 
does not allow coal seams to release gases adsorbed on coal surface at faster rates as in the case of coal faces in 
underground or surface mines. The emission factors are only a fraction of the corresponding emission factors for 
surface and underground coal mining. 
Tier 2 – Basin-Specific Approach 
For a Tier 2 approach the exploratory borehole emissions factors may be evaluated as described below: 
Emission Factor: 
Information about basins or coalfields wherever methane emission measurements from coal exploration 
boreholes have been conducted, should be collected first. Average value of the emission (m3) from 
accessible data in the basin should be calculated to evaluate methane emission per exploration borehole 
(m3/exploratory borehole). This value of methane emission per exploration borehole should be used as 
emission factor (m3/exploratory borehole) for the basin which should be multiplied by the number of 
exploration boreholes drilled in the basin to obtain volume of fugitive methane emission (m3) from 
exploratory boreholes drilled in the basin. Tier 1 emission default emission factors may be used for the 
basins or coalfields wherever number of exploration boreholes drilled are unknown or emission factor as 
described above cannot be evaluated. 
Conversion Factor: 
This is the density of CH4 and converts volume of CH4 to mass of CH4. The density is taken at 20˚C and 1 
atmosphere pressure and has a value of 0.67●10-6 Gg m-3. 
Tier 3 – Borehole Specific Approach 
Coal exploration companies often determine in situ gas content and other desorption characteristics such as 
sorption time of coal seams encountered during exploratory drilling of boreholes, Langmuir volume, Langmuir 
pressure and permeability etc. Release of gas from a coal seam is highly dependent on these parameters. Models 
are also available to calculate emissions if the gas desorption parameters are available. A Tier 3 approach can be 
developed if gas desorption parameters are available. 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
4.148 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
4A.1.2.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Augmentation of resources or new addition of resources in the year may be used as activity data, which may be 
available in the inventory of coal or lignite resources or can be easily obtained by subtracting the resources for a 
year and the resources for the previous year as follows: 
Augmentation or New Addition = Resource for a year – Resource for the previous year 
The above activity data may be used for Tier 1 estimates. A precise value for activity data may be available for 
net increase of depth-wise resource. Often coal resources are reported in the depth ranges such as 0-600 m and 
600-1200 m and higher than 1200 m. Since gas content of coal seams generally increases with depth, emission 
from deeper seams will be higher compared to the seams at shallow depths. These values of activity data 
correspond to Tier 1 estimates. 
Number of exploration boreholes drilled in a reporting period will be used as activity data for Tier 2 and Tier 3 
methods. 
4A.1.2.4 COMPLETENESS 
Exploration for coal is generally carried out in two broad categories, often called as Regional and Detailed 
Exploration. During regional exploration, coal resources of inferred or indicated categories using data obtained 
from boreholes few kilometres apart (typically 2 to 4 km) are estimated. Detailed exploration is carried out to 
arrive at measured or proved resource using data from boreholes normally drilled less than a kilometre apart 
(typically 400 m). The number and distribution of boreholes during detailed exploration are sufficient to allow a 
realistic estimate of average coal thickness, areal extent, depth range, quality and mineable reserve of coal. The 
estimate of fugitive methane emission from coal exploration boreholes should include all emissions from the 
following: 
• Gas released from boreholes during regional exploration; 
• Emission of gas from boreholes during detailed exploration. 
4A.1.2.5 DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
Time series consistency should be maintained in a manner consistent with guidance set out in Volume 1, Chapter 
5. 
A complete borehole specific data may not be available for the base year and also for the succeeding years. It may 
be imperative, therefore, to prepare a combination of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 estimates. 
If Tier 2 or Tier 3 methods are used for exploration boreholes for certain inventory years, emissions should be 
scaled-up or scaled-down for the remaining years using an appropriate value (low, average or high) of Tier 1 
emission factor. 
4A.1.2.6 UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
The activity data of resource augmentation in Tier 1 method is reasonably accurately known (±5 percent). 
However, there may be uncertainties on account of extrapolation techniques used for estimation of inferred and 
indicated categories of coal resources. Thus, combining the errors in estimation of different category of resources 
(such as proved, inferred and indicated), the activity data of resource augmentation may have an uncertainty of 
±10 percent. In borehole specific approach (Tier 3 method), where number of boreholes, number of coal seams 
encountered, their thicknesses and in situ gas content etc. are known, uncertainty may be in the range of ±1 – 2 
percent. 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
Uncertainties in Tier 1 approach mainly arise because of use of global emission factors. There may be some 
intrinsic uncertainties in the emission factors as well. As combination of these effects, the uncertainties in Tier 1 
approach may be greater or smaller by a factor of 3, that is actual emissions are likely to be in the range of one-
third to three times of the estimated value of fugitive methane emission. 
Tier 2 estimates may also have liability to vary due to inherent uncertainties associated with basin level 
characteristics. Uncertainties in Tier 2 approach may be ±75-100 percent. 
Chapter 4: Fugitive Emissions

Coal characteristics, in situ gas content and other gas desorption parameters are often determined for a selected 
number of exploration boreholes. These parameters vary considerably in lateral directions in an exploration field. 
Tier 3 estimates may be accurate to ±50 percent depending on number of boreholes tested for gas desorption 
parameters.

Appendix 4A.2 Fugitive Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Wood 
Pellet production: Basis for Future Methodological Development 
Fugitive emissions are likely from the wood pellet production. The quantities of emissions will be variable, and 
uncertain. At the time the 2019 Refinement was created, there was insufficient information available in the 
scientific literature to select emission factors suitable for estimating emissions and therefore a methodology is not 
provided. If countries have developed country specific methods for estimating emissions from biomass 
transformation process, they may estimate and report emissions. This appendix provides a basis for future 
methodological development to estimate fugitive greenhouse gas emissions from wood pellet production. 
BACKGROUND 
Biomass is the fourth largest source of energy worldwide and provides basic energy requirements for cooking and 
heating of rural households in developing countries. Biomass densification has aroused a great deal of interest in 
recent years as a technique to enhance the use of residues as energy source. The densified biomass produced is 
mostly in the form of briquettes in developing countries and in the form of pellets in developed countries. 
Wood Pellets 
Wood pellets are a type of wood fuel, usually produced as a by-product of sawmilling and other wood 
transformation activities. Wood pellets are normally produced by compressing dry wood materials to a desired 
size. First, raw wood materials are passed through a hammer mill and dryer to achieve consistent moisture content. 
Then, the dry wood particles are fed to a press. In the press they are squeezed through a die having holes of the 
required size. The high pressure causes the temperature of the wood to increase greatly, causing the lignin to 
plasticize slightly and form a natural ‘glue’ that holds the pellet together. The pellets are usually 6 to 8 mm in 
diameter and 2 cm in length. 
According to Global Bionergy Statistics 2017 (WBA, 2018), 28 million tonnes of pellets are produced annually. 
Pellets are thus contributing substantially to global bioenergy trade. Pelleting technology is also considered as a 
mature technology. From environmental context, it is well documented that all biomass gradually decomposes 
over time, both chemically and biologically, slowly releasing toxic and oxygen-depleting gases such as CO, CO2 
and CH4 (Kuang et al., 2008). Limited studies (Svedberg et al., 2004) have reported the composition of the off-
gas emissions from stored wood pellets. However, CO, CO2, CH4 and non-methane organic compounds are 
commonly identified in the off-gases from biomass (Johansson et al., 2004). At the pellet production plant, 
emission of fugitive methane (CH4) gas may occur at the various stages of production. These include: Pre-
processing where the raw material is chipped into small bits; Pelleting; Pellet drying; Pellet storage and pellet 
drying (Figure 4Ap.2.2). The delivery, storage and processing of raw materials for pellet production and 
subsequent handling of the pellets within the pelleting plant enhances the fugitive emissions over and above the 
emissions associated with natural decay. 
Specifically, emissions to air may occur during the wood pellet manufacturing process from sources such as dryers, 
coolers, pelletizers, hammer mills, and conveyors. Fugitive emissions are also released during the handling, storage 
and transportation of the materials. Fugitive emissions are unintentional or incidental releases. The significance of 
fugitive emissions at wood pellet manufacturing facilities may vary depending on the type of raw material, method 
of transportation and specific process used in the production of the wood pellets. Major sources of these emissions 
include raw material handling, raw material storage piles, conveyor transfer points, yard dust, haul road dust and 
engine exhaust (British Columbia, Ministry of Environment, 2011). 
The process of wood pellet production follows various distinct stages which include: receipt of the raw material, 
storage, drying, grinding pelleting, cooling and packaging as illustrated in Figure 4Ap.2.1.

Fugitive Emissions from Pellet Production 
The fugitive emissions arising during the pellet manufacture would be classified under category 1B1c of the 2006 
IPCC Guidelines, as they are part of emissions from solid to solid fuel transformations. The possible sources of 
fugitive emissions from pellet production are indicated in Figure 4Ap.2.2. Inventory compilers need consider 
including only emissions arising within the pellet mill, namely from the receipt of the raw materials to the storage 
of pellets prior to transportation to end user.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
The CO2 fugitive emissions from the biomass and the biomass part of MSW (municipal solid waste) are biogenic 
emissions and should be estimated for inclusion as an information item in the Energy Sector, as those feedstocks 
are combusted for energy purposes. For more information on reporting of biomass emissions, please see Section 
2.3.3.4 in Volume 2, Chapter 2. 
The choice of the method for estimating the fugitive emission depends on the nature and level of disaggregation 
of activity data and emission factors available in the country. Where there is no country or technology specific 
data, a Tier 1 method could be developed to estimate emissions using default emission factors. In the case where 
country specific emission factors are available but the activity data are not disaggregated by each transformation 
technology, a Tier 2 method could be developed. Finally, where technology specific data and emission factors are 
available, a Tier 3 method could be used. A proposed decision tree for estimating emissions from solid biomass 
fuel transformation is given in Figure 4Ap.2.3.

CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTOR 
The fugitive emissions from the pellet manufacture are confined to the milling plant but exclude the process energy 
used for the compaction process. The available literature reviewed at the time of writing (Sjølie and Birger, 2011; 
Agar et al, 2015; Murphy et al, 2015, Magelli et al, 2009; and Wang et al, 2017) provided emission factors for 
pellet production largely based on lifecycle analysis. No emission factors suitable for use in national GHG 
inventories were found to allow the estimation of the fugitive emissions arising at pellet production operations. 
Choice of activity data 
The activity data required to enable for the estimation of fugitive emissions arising during the manufacture of 
pellets from solid biomass materials. These include the: 
• Quantity of solid biomass input materials including biomass waste and cut wood, available for pelleting; 
• Quantity of the pellet and duration of storage prior to being transported to final end-use points.

Appendix 4A.3 
Fugitive Emissions from Biomass to Liquid and 
Biomass to Gas: Basis for Future Methodological Development 
This Appendix provides a basis for future methodological development rather than complete guidance. 
Biomass to gaseous (BtG) and biomass to liquid (BtL) gasification transformation processes are processes that use 
as feedstock woody biomass, agricultural and forest residues and waste biomass (sorted municipal and commercial 
waste), for example. Therefore, these feedstocks used in these processes does not have carbon of fossil origin, 
except from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) that might include some carbon of fossil origin. The CO2 fugitive 
emissions from the biomass and the biomass part of MSW are biogenic emissions and should be estimated for 
inclusion as an information item in the Energy Sector, as those feedstocks are combusted for energy purposes. For 
more information on reporting of biomass emissions, please see Section 2.3.3.4 in Volume 2. 
Currently, most BtG and BtL plants are either on demonstration or pilot scales and, hence, there is minimal 
literature describing research into the emissions from these processes (Van der Drift & Boerrigter, 2006; 
OECD/IEA, 2007; Ail & Dasappa, 2016; NETL/DOE, 2016). 
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES 
The choice of method will depend on the technologies that are operational in countries, including whether the 
technologies analysed in this section are key categories in the country, and to what extent country and plant-
specific information is available or can be gathered. 
The most accurate fugitive emission estimates can be developed by determining the emissions on a plant-by-plant 
basis and/or differentiated for each feedstock category (e.g., wood biomass, agricultural and forest residues and 
MSW). The methods for estimating CO2, CH4 and N2O fugitive emissions from these technologies vary because 
of the different factors that influence emission levels. 
The general approach to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from those technologies is to obtain the amount of 
feedstock used and to investigate the related greenhouse gas emission factors, preferably from country-specific 
information on the carbon content. 
To estimate fugitive CO2 emissions, it will be necessary to: 
• Identify types of biomass used as feedstock (wood, agriculture and forest residue or waste biomass (sorted 
municipal and/or commercial waste)); 
• Compile data on the amount of feedstock used (e.g. amount of biomass or amount of syngas produced, when 
MSW is the feedstock used in BtL or BtG plants). 
CHOICE OF METHODS, DECISION TREES, TIERS 
There is limited information about gasification transformation technologies. From the information available, it was 
considered that fugitive emissions are most likely to occur at the gasification stage. The fugitive emissions resulting 
from the syngas transformation at the Fischer-Tropsch stage were considered negligible, as it is an energy related 
processes. 
The method for estimating fugitive emissions from BtL and BtG technologies is based on an estimate of the carbon 
content in the feedstock combusted and converting the product to greenhouse gas emissions. 
As BtG and BtL are still emerging technologies, and there are currently very few large scale plants worldwide and 
methodologies to calculate Tier 2 and Tier 3 are not provided. Inventory compilers could choose to use higher Tier 
methods to estimate emissions, but they need to transparently document the approaches used and state how their 
methods accurately and completely estimate emissions. 
The activity data required is the amount of biomass inputs into BtL or BtG processes in terajoules (TJ) and the 
syngas produced, when MSW is the feedstock input, and the emission factors are based on the carbon content of 
the feedstock. 
The choice of method depends on the country specific information available, and is given in the decision tree in 
Figure 4.3.7, in the Subsection 4.3.2.2 Gasification Transformation Processes. 
TIER 1 
The Tier 1 method is a simple method that can be used when fugitive emissions from BtG and BtL technologies 
are not significant. 
When biomass is the feedstock used in BtL and BtG plants, fugitive emissions of CO2, CH4 can be estimated from 
the amount of biomass (such as wood and agriculture and forest residues) used in BtL and BtG plants and the 
Volume 2: Energy 
 
4.156 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
related emission factors. Fugitive Emissions of N2O at BtL or BtG gasification facilities can be considered 
negligible. 
If Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is the feedstock used in BtL or BtG plants, fugitive emissions of CO2, CH4 and 
N2O can be estimated from the amount of syngas produced and the emission factor for fugitive emissions. 
The application of a Tier1 approach is done using Equation 4Ap.3.1 presented below.

1 percent of fugitive emissions are release in the gasification stage (Table 4Ap.3.1). It was also considered that all 
the biomass is burned, and that there is no char formation. Asadullah (2014) provides information on gas 
composition (H2, CO, CH4, CO2, N2) by volume percent of 15 biomass gasification plants that use as feedstocks 
wood chip, eucalyptus wood, sawdust, sunflower seed pellet, corncob, olive kernel, wood, rice husk, poplar chips, 
and seed corn.

There is no available information to estimate emission factor for fugitive emissions from BtG and BtL facilities 
related to MSW feedstock. 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The activity data required for Tier 1 and Tier 2 are the amount of biomass gasified at gasification stage in terajoules 
(TJ) or the amount of syngas produced in terajoules (TJ), when MSW is the feedstock used in BtG and BtL plants. 
Countries that use these technologies should have plant-specific data on the amount of biomass gasified or the 
syngas produced. 
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT 
Biomass to gaseous and biomass to liquid technologies 
Estimates of fugitive emissions from BtG and BtL facilities are likely to be highly uncertain due to lack of 
information about fugitive emissions from these technologies. More research and development is needed on these 
technologies, especially direct measurement on all stages to confirm which ones present fugitive emissions.

Emission factor uncertainties 
There is minimal information in the literature from which to derive emission factors, and there are currently few 
large scale BtG and BtL facilities. The fugitive emission factors provided in these guidelines were estimated based 
on very few data and uncertainties are large. 
Activity data uncertainties 
Where activity data are obtained from plants, uncertainty estimates could be obtained from the plant operators.
