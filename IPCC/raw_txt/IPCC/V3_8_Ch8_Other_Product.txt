8 OTHER PRODUCT MANUFACTURE AND USE 
8.1 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter outlines methods for estimating emissions of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and perfluorocarbons 
(PFCs) from the manufacture and use of electrical equipment and a number of other products. It also provides 
methods for estimating emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from several products. In most of these applications, 
the SF6, PFC, or N2O is deliberately incorporated into the product to exploit one or more of the physical 
properties of the chemical, such as the high dielectric strength of SF6, the stability PFCs, and the anaesthetic 
effect of N2O. However, the applications discussed here have a wide range of emission profiles, ranging from 
immediate and unavoidable release of all of the chemical (e.g., use of PFCs as atmospheric tracers) to largely 
avoidable, delayed release from leak-tight products after 40 years of use (e.g., manufacture and use of sealed-
pressure electrical equipment). The estimation methods presented in the chapter have been tailored to reflect 
these differences in emission profiles. 
Section 8.2 details methods for estimating SF6 and PFC emissions from electrical equipment. Section 8.3 details 
methods for estimating emissions from the manufacture and use of a wide variety of other industrial, commercial, 
and consumer products that contain SF6 and PFCs, excluding those discussed elsewhere in this volume (e.g., 
PFC emissions from electronics manufacturing, which are discussed in Chapter 6). (Please see the introduction 
to Section 8.3 for the list of excluded sources.) Finally, Section 8.4 discusses methods for estimating N2O 
emissions from anaesthetics, propellants, and other product uses.  
8.2 
EMISSIONS OF SF6 AND PFCs FROM 
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT 
8.2.1 
Introduction 
Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) is used for electrical insulation and current interruption in equipment used in the 
transmission and distribution of electricity. Emissions occur at each phase of the equipment life cycle, including 
manufacturing, installation, use, servicing, and disposal. Most of the SF6 used in electrical equipment is used in 
gas insulated switchgear and substations (GIS) and in gas circuit breakers (GCB), though some SF6 is used in 
high voltage gas-insulated lines (GIL), outdoor gas-insulated instrument transformers and other equipment. The 
aforementioned applications may be divided into two categories of containment. The first category is ‘Sealed 
Pressure Systems’ or ‘Sealed-for-life Equipment’, which is defined as equipment that does not require any 
refilling (topping up) with gas during its lifetime and which generally contains less than 5 kg of gas per 
functional unit.1 Distribution equipment normally falls into this category. The second category is ‘Closed 
Pressure Systems’, which is defined to include equipment that requires refilling (topping up) with gas during its 
lifetime. This type of equipment generally contains between 5 and several hundred kg per functional unit. 
Transmission equipment normally falls into this category. Both categories of equipment have lifetimes of more 
than 30 to 40 years. In Asia, significant quantities of SF6 are used in gas-insulated power transformers (GIT).  
Electrical equipment is the largest consumer and most important use of SF6, globally. It significantly contributes 
to worldwide SF6 emissions. However, the importance of this source varies considerably from region to region 
and from country to country. The emissions from this category depend not only on the installed (banked) or 
consumed quantities of SF6, but also very much on the tightness of the products and the handling processes 
applied. Regional average emission rates presently vary between far less than 1 percent to more than 10 percent. 
In general, emission rates have declined significantly since 1995. Targeted industry actions have reduced 
emissions by 50 to 90 percent in Europe and Asia (Ecofys, 2005; Aoyama, 2004). These actions include (1) 
                                                           
1  Formal definitions of ‘sealed-pressure system’ and ‘closed-pressure system’ are contained in International Electro-
technical Commission (IEC) Standard 60694. (IEC, 1996)

designing equipment to require a smaller charge of SF6 and to be more leak tight and (2) improving handling 
processes and handling equipment for all life cycle stages.2  
In some regions (e.g., North America and Japan), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are used as dielectrics and heat 
transfer fluids in power transformers. PFCs are also used for retrofitting CFC-113 cooled transformers. One PFC 
used in this application is perfluorohexane (C6F14). In terms of both absolute and carbon-weighted emissions, 
PFC emissions from electrical equipment are generally believed to be much smaller than SF6 emissions from 
electrical equipment; however, there may be regional exceptions to this pattern.  
8.2.2 
Methodological issues 
8.2.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
Emissions of SF6 from electrical equipment can be estimated in a variety of ways with varying degrees of 
complexity and data intensity. This section describes good practice for using a Tier 1 method (the default 
emission-factor approach), a Tier 2 method (the country-specific emission-factor approach), and a Tier 3 
method (a hybrid that can use either mass-balance or emission-factor approaches for different life cycle stages, 
depending on country-specific circumstances). Generally, emissions estimates developed using the Tier 3 
method, which is implemented at the facility level, will be the most accurate. Estimates developed using the Tier 
1 method will be the least accurate. 
As is true for other emission sources, the tier selected will depend on data availability and whether or not the 
category is key. Figure 8.1, Decision Tree for SF6 from Electrical Equipment, summarises the process for 
choosing among Tiers 3, 2, and 1. Good practice in choosing between the mass-balance and emission-factor 
variants of the Tier 3 approach is discussed in detail in Section 1.5 of Chapter 1. This choice will depend both on 
data availability and on country-specific circumstances. As a first step in assessing the importance of SF6 
emissions from electrical equipment and the other categories discussed in this chapter, inventory compilers are 
encouraged to contact chemical producers and suppliers as well as electrical equipment manufacturers and 
utilities and/or their industry associations. These organisations can provide basic information on chemical 
consumption and on equipment stocks and applications that can help the inventory compiler estimate emissions 
and identify sources that merit further investigation. They can also provide important advice and support in 
establishing more extensive data collection systems to support Tier 2 and Tier 3 estimates.

TIER 1 METHOD – DEFAULT EMISSION FACTORS 
The Tier 1 approach is the simplest approach for estimating SF6 and PFC emissions from electrical equipment. 
(Henceforth in this section, ‘SF6’ will be used to denote ‘SF6 and/or PFCs.’) In this method, emissions are 
estimated by multiplying default regional emission factors by, as appropriate, the SF6 consumption of equipment 
manufacturers and/or by the nameplate SF6 capacity of the equipment at each life cycle stage beyond 
manufacturing in the country. The term Installation Emissions may be omitted if (1) installation emissions are 
not expected to occur (i.e., for closed-pressure equipment) or (2) installation emissions are included in the 
emission factor for emissions from Manufacturing or Use. Default emission factors are given in Tables 8.2 to 8.4. 
It is good practice to use the following equation: 
EQUATION 8.1 
DEFAULT EMISSION FACTOR METHOD 
Total Emissions = Manufacturing Emissions + Equipment Installation Emissions  
            + Equipment Use Emissions + Equipment Disposal Emissions 
Where: 
Chapter 8: Other Product Manufacture and Use 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
8.9 
Manufacturing emissions = Manufacturing Emission Factor • Total SF6 consumption by equipment 
manufacturers  
Equipment installation emissions = Installation Emission Factor • Total nameplate capacity of new 
equipment filled on site (not at the factory).  
Equipment use emissions = Use Emission Factor • Total nameplate capacity of installed equipment. The 
‘use emission factor’ includes emissions due to leakage, servicing, and maintenance as well as 
failures 
Equipment disposal emissions = Total nameplate capacity of retiring equipment • Fraction of SF6 
remaining at retirement 
 
TIER 2 METHOD – COUNTRY-SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTOR METHOD 
The Tier 2 method uses the same basic equation as Tier 1, but requires reliable country-specific emission factors 
for each life cycle stage. Country-specific emission factors will be more accurate because they reflect the unique 
circumstances in which electrical equipment is used in a given country. In addition, if detailed data for 
equipment retirement are available, emissions due to retirement can be estimated more accurately. The 
expression for Equipment Disposal Emissions in the Tier 2 method includes terms accounting for SF6 recovery 
at retirement and disposal, as follows: 
EQUATION 8.2 
EQUIPMENT DISPOSAL EMISSIONS UNDER COUNTRY-SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTOR METHOD 
Equipment disposal emissions = Total nameplate capacity of retiring equipment • Fraction of SF6 
remaining at retirement • (1 – fraction of retiring equipment whose SF6 is recovered • recovery 
efficiency • fraction of recovered SF6 recycled, reused with no further treatment, or destroyed*) 
*This final term is intended to account for emissions during chemical recycling and destruction. 
Note that to be considered Tier 2, estimates must be developed using only country-specific emission factors. 
 
TIER 3 HYBRID METHOD – EMISSIONS BY LIFE CYCLE STAGE OF 
EQUIPMENT 
The Tier 3 method is the most accurate approach for estimating actual emissions of SF6 from electrical 
equipment. This method is detailed but flexible, accommodating a wide range of national circumstances. The 
method is implemented at the facility level and includes separate equations for each phase of the life cycle of 
equipment, including equipment manufacture, installation, use, and disposal. Depending on the type of 
equipment, the life cycle stage, and country-specific circumstances, either a mass-balance approach or country- 
(or facility-) specific emission factors may be used. In general, it is good practice to use the mass-balance 
approach, except where (1) emission rates from a process are near or below the precision of the measurements 
required for the mass-balance approach (e.g., 3 percent of nameplate capacity per year or less), (2) equipment is 
never serviced during its lifetime (as is expected to be the case for sealed pressure equipment), or (3) equipment 
stocks are growing very rapidly, as may be the case in countries where electrical equipment has been introduced 
within the last 10-20 years.  
The hybrid approach enhances accuracy by permitting use of the mass-balance approach for some processes and 
life cycle stages and the emission-factor approach for other processes and life cycle stages. However, the 
combination of different approaches also introduces opportunities for double-counting or overlooking emissions. 
Inventory compilers need to be aware of this problem and take steps to avoid it. Table 8.1, Avoiding Double-
Counting or Overlooking Emissions, provides examples of both the problem and some potential solutions.  
The annex to this chapter (Annex 8A) briefly describes an example of the Tier 3 approach as it has been applied 
in Germany. This example is intended to illustrate rather than prescribe; the precise approach taken by any given 
country will depend on country-specific circumstances. 
Ideally, data are obtained for every equipment manufacturer, electricity transmission and distribution facility 
(utility), equipment disposer (which may be a manufacturer, electric utility, or other entity), and SF6 recycling or 
destruction facility in the country, and the emissions of all manufacturers, utilities, disposers, and recycling or 
destruction facilities are summed to develop the national estimate. The basic equation is:

Where: 
Equipment Manufacturing Emissions at the facility level can be estimated by Equations 8.4A and 8.4B. 
Equipment Installation Emissions at the facility level can be estimated by Equations 8.5A and 8.5B. 
Equipment Use Emissions at the facility level can be estimated by Equations 8.6A and 8.6B. 
Equipment Disposal and Final Use Emissions at the facility level can be estimated by Equations 8.7A and 
8.7B. 
Emissions from SF6 Recycling and Destruction at the facility level can be estimated by Equations 8.8 and 
8.9. 
In the above equation, national emissions for each phase are equal to the sum of the emissions of all equipment 
manufacturers, equipment users, equipment disposers, or SF6 recyclers/destroyers at that phase. In practice, it is 
not always possible to obtain data for every facility; in these cases countries may use one of the extrapolation 
methods discussed in Section 8.2.2.3, Choice of Activity Data.  
Equipment manufacturing emissions 
Equipment manufacturing emissions can be estimated using either a pure mass-balance approach or a mixture 
(hybrid) of a mass-balance approach for some processes and an emission-factor based approach for others. The 
pure mass-balance approach is preferred except where a substantial fraction of a manufacturer’s emissions come 
from processes whose emission rates fall below the precision of the measurements required for the mass-balance 
approach (e.g., 3 percent of nameplate capacity per year or less). In these cases, it is good practice to use 
emission factors to estimate emissions from the processes with very low emission rates and to use the mass-
balance approach to estimate emissions from the other manufacturing processes. 
Pure mass-balance approach: Using the pure mass-balance approach, the total emissions of each equipment 
manufacturer can be estimated using the following equation:

Where: 
Decrease in SF6 Inventory = SF6 stored in containers at the beginning of the year – SF6 stored in 
containers at the end of the year  
Acquisitions of SF6 = SF6 purchased from chemical producers or distributors in bulk + SF6 returned by 
equipment users or distributors with or inside of equipment + SF6 returned to site after off-site 
recycling 
Disbursements of SF6 = SF6 contained in new equipment delivered to customers + SF6 delivered to 
equipment users in containers + SF6 returned to suppliers + SF6 sent off-site for recycling + SF6 
destroyed 
Hybrid approach: This method first requires that manufacturers separate the gas flows associated with processes 
for which the mass-balance approach will be used from the gas flows associated with processes for which the 
emission-factor approach will be used. Emissions from the former can then be estimated using the approach 
outlined in Equation 8.4A. Emissions from the latter can be estimated by multiplying the total nameplate 
capacity of equipment undergoing each process (e.g., filling) by the country- or facility-specific emission factor 
for that process. Total emissions for each manufacturer are then estimated by summing the emissions from both 
sets of processes, using the following equation:

Equipment installation emissions may be estimated using either a mass-balance or an emission-factor approach. 
Again, the mass-balance approach is preferred except where emission rates are very low.

outlined in Equation 8.5A. Emissions from the latter can be estimated by multiplying the newly installed 
nameplate capacity of each equipment type by the country- or facility-specific installation emission factor for 
that type. Total emissions for each installer are then estimated by summing the emissions from both sets of 
equipments, using the following equation:

Equipment use emissions may be estimated using either a pure mass-balance or a hybrid approach. The pure

been in use for 10-20 years or more, and (2) emissions from sealed-pressure systems are likely to be negligible. 
The hybrid approach is likely to be appropriate for other countries.  
Pure mass-balance approach: Using the pure mass-balance approach, the total emissions of each equipment user

approach, based on country-specific circumstances. In both the pure mass-balance and hybrid approaches, 
emissions from closed-pressure equipment are estimated using a mass-balance equation. In the pure mass-
balance approach, emissions from sealed-pressure systems are also estimated using a mass-balance equation. In 
the hybrid approach, emissions from sealed-pressure systems are estimated using an emission-factor-based term.  
Pure mass-balance approach: In countries where the gas-collection infrastructure (including recovery equipment, 
technician training, and economic or legal incentives to recover) is not very well-developed or widely applied, it 
is good practice to use the pure mass-balance approach, as follows:

EQUIPMENT DISPOSAL AND FINAL USE EMISSIONS - PURE MASS-BALANCE

Where: 
Disposal and final use emissions from closed-pressure equipment = Nameplate capacity of retired closed-
pressure equipment – SF6 recovered from retired closed-pressure equipment, and 
Disposal and final use emissions from sealed-pressure equipment (MB) = Nameplate capacity of retired 
sealed-pressure systems – SF6 recovered from retired sealed-pressure systems  
Note that if the inventory compiler uses the emission-factor approach to estimate ‘use emissions’ from sealed-
pressure equipment, a term should be subtracted from the second equation to avoid double counting. See Table 
8.1, Avoiding Double-Counting or Overlooking Emissions: Two Examples, for this term. 
Hybrid approach: In countries where the disposal of equipment is well controlled and understood (i.e., where an 
efficient gas collection infrastructure is in place) and where emissions from use of sealed-pressure equipment are 
accounted for under ‘use’ above, the hybrid approach may be used, as follows:

Where: 
Disposal and final use emissions from closed-pressure equipment = Nameplate capacity of retired closed-

Disposal emissions from sealed-pressure equipment (EF) = [(Nameplate capacity of retired sealed-
pressure systems) – (Nameplate capacity of retired sealed-pressure systems • Use emission factor • 
Lifetime of equipment)] • (1 – fraction of retiring equipment whose SF6 is recovered • recovery 
efficiency) 
As noted above, emissions estimated using the above approach should be periodically checked, e.g., by using a 
pure mass-balance approach and/or assessing recovery frequency and practices. Inventory compilers should pay 
particular attention to the fraction of retiring equipment whose SF6 is recovered and to the fraction of the charge 
that is recovered when recovery is performed (‘recovery efficiency’). Even in countries where it is the norm to 
recover SF6 from retiring equipment, some venting may occur, and the venting of just a few percent of the SF6 in 
Chapter 8: Other Product Manufacture and Use 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
8.13 
retiring equipment will drive emission rates far above the minimum that is technically achievable and that would 
otherwise be a reasonable basis for an emission factor. 
Emissions from SF6 recycling and destruction  
Some SF6 emissions occur after the chemical is recovered. These emissions include (1) emissions associated 
with recycling of SF6, and (2) emissions associated with the destruction of SF6. (Emissions associated with the 
shipment of SF6 to off-site recyclers or destruction facilities are considered negligible.) Emissions from recycling 
of SF6 are generally expected to be small — on the order of less than one percent of the total quantity fed into the 
recycling process. However, these emissions may be higher if state-of-the art handling equipment and practices 
are not used. In most cases, recycling is expected to occur on the site of the equipment manufacturer or user. In 
other cases, recycling may take place at a centralised recycling facility that is not associated with a chemical 
producer. Finally, recycling may take place on the premises of a chemical producer. Recycling emissions from 
chemical producers will be accounted for under chemical production (see Section 3.10 of this volume) and 
should not be included here.  
Emissions associated with the destruction of SF6 depend on the destruction efficiency of the process and the 
quantity of SF6 fed into the process. Given the high stability and dissociation temperature of SF6, the destruction 
efficiency may be as low as 90 percent. Thus, up to 10 percent of the SF6 fed into the destruction process could 
be emitted. The quantity of gas fed into the destruction process is generally expected to be small compared to 
that recycled. However, this may vary from country to country.  
It is good practice to develop country-specific emission factors for recycling and destruction that are based on 
full consideration of country-specific logistics and practices for SF6 recycling and destruction. 
Emissions from recycling of SF6 may be estimated using the following equation: 
EQUATION 8.8 
EMISSIONS FROM RECYCLING OF SF6* 
Emissions from Recycling = Recycling emission factor • Quantity SF6 fed into recycling process  
*Emissions from recycling that occurs at chemical production facilities should be excluded. 
Emissions from destruction of SF6 may be estimated using the following equation: 
EQUATION 8.9 
EMISSIONS FROM DESTRUCTION OF SF6 
Emissions from Destruction = Destruction emission factor • Quantity SF6 fed into destruction 
process 
 
TABLE 8.1 
AVOIDING DOUBLE-COUNTING OR OVERLOOKING EMISSIONS: TWO EXAMPLES 
Example 1 – Double Counting 
Example 2 – Omission  
Situation: An emission-factor approach is used to 
estimate emissions from sealed-pressure equipment 
during use, and a mass-balance approach is used to 
estimate emissions during disposal of sealed-pressure 
equipment.  
Situation: A mass-balance approach is used to estimate 
emissions during use of closed-pressure equipment, but 
an emission-factor approach is used to estimate 
emissions during disposal of closed-pressure. 
Potential problem: Emissions during use may be 
double-counted because some of the SF6 that is found to 
be missing when the equipment is disposed has already 
been counted as emitted during use.  
 
Potential problem: Emissions that occur between the 
final servicing of the equipment and its disposal may be 
overlooked. These ‘final use’ emissions may account for 
a significant fraction of total use emissions, particularly 
if the equipment is refilled every 10 years or more. 
Solution: Subtract lifetime use emissions (Nameplate 
capacity of retired sealed-pressure systems • Use 
emission factor • Lifetime of equipment) from emissions 
during disposal. 
Solution: Use the mass-balance approach for both the 
use and disposal phases of the closed-pressure equipment 
life cycle.

A special case of the Tier 3 method: the utility-level, pure mass-balance 
approach 
Countries that satisfy the good practice criteria for using the pure mass-balance approach beyond equipment 
manufacturing (i.e., countries where emissions during equipment installation, use, and disposal account for 3 
percent or more of facility-level gas flows, where electrical equipment has been used for 10-20 years or more, 
and where emissions from sealed-pressure equipment are negligible), may, with little or no loss of accuracy, use 
a simplified version of the Tier 3 method to estimate emissions during equipment use. When summed together 
and reformulated in terms of facility-level gas flows, equations 8.5A, 8.6A, and 8.7A result in the following 
equation: 
EQUATION 8.10 
UTILITY-LEVEL MASS-BALANCE APPROACH 
User Emissions = Decrease in SF6 Inventory + Acquisitions of SF6 – Disbursements of SF6  
– Net Increase in the Nameplate Capacity of Equipment  
Where: 
Decrease in SF6 Inventory = SF6 stored in containers at the beginning of the year – SF6 stored in 
containers at the end of the year  
Acquisitions of SF6 = SF6 purchased from chemical producers or distributors in bulk + SF6 purchased 
from equipment manufacturers or distributors with or inside of equipment + SF6 returned to site after 
off-site recycling 
Disbursements of SF6 = SF6 contained in equipment that is sold to other entities + SF6 returned to 
suppliers + SF6 sent off-site for recycling + SF6 destroyed 
Net Increase in Nameplate Capacity of Equipment = Nameplate Capacity of New Equipment – 
Nameplate Capacity of Retiring Equipment 
Although the utility-level approach is less detailed than the full life cycle approach, it is simple, and for those 
countries whose national circumstances permit its use, it provides estimates that are closely related to actual gas 
loss. 
SF6 EMISSIONS FROM MANUFACTURING OF ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS  
Some electrical equipment components may contain 1 percent or less by weight of SF6 in the insulating medium 
of the product. These components include but are not limited to medium voltage cast resin instrument 
transformers and high voltage bushings. In medium voltage (up to 52 kV) cast resin instrument transformers, SF6 
is used to fill up micro-cavities in the resin insulation to improve the dielectric quality and durability of the 
product. In High Voltage (above 52 kV) bushings, SF6 is used as the blowing agent for the polyurethane resin in 
certain parts of the insulation system to improve the dielectric quality and durability of the product. 
SF6 emissions solely result from the casting/blowing process for the solid insulation of the product. All SF6 used 
is assumed to be emitted at the manufacturing stage. To estimate emissions from this source, the pure mass-
balance approach for equipment manufacturers (Equation 8.4A) may be used, setting the SF6 contained in new 
equipment equal to zero.  
Emission reduction measures focus on limiting losses/improving rate of recycling by suction devices and/or 
improved casting processes. SF6 in this type of high voltage bushings may be replaced by another blowing agent 
in the future. 
8.2.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Because emission rates can vary not only from country to country but from facility to facility, inventory 
compilers using emission-factor based methods are encouraged to develop and use their own emission factors. 
Surveying a representative sample of equipment manufacturers and utilities within the country is an effective 
way to develop such factors. In general, it is good practice to document the evidence and reasoning supporting 
the selected emission factors, and to review these factors at least every 5 years. 
Factors that influence emission rates include the design of the equipment (which varies depending on when and 
where the equipment was manufactured), SF6-handling practices, availability of state-of-the-art handling 
equipment, SF6 prices, and regulations (e.g., recovery requirements). Variation of any one of these can change 
emission rates over time or among countries. 
Chapter 8: Other Product Manufacture and Use 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
8.15 
TIER 1 METHOD 
Suggested default emission factors have been developed for some regions based on recent research. These 
factors are shown in Tables 8.2-8.4 below.  
It is good practice to select default emission factors from countries and regions with equipment designs and SF6-
handling practices similar to those of the country whose emissions are being estimated. Because Japan and 
Europe supply most of the global demand for electrical equipment, equipment designs are likely to be similar to 
those of either Japan or Europe. With the exception of the factors for the U.S., regional default emission factors 
are those documented for 1995, i.e., before any special industry actions for emission reduction were 
implemented. In Japan in 1995, approximately 70 percent of the SF6 used to test equipment during manufacture 
was recovered, and a similar percentage was recovered during equipment maintenance for equipment rated 110 
kv or higher. (The 70 percent recovery fraction reflected recovery from an initial pressure of about 5 bars 
absolute to a final pressure of 1 to 1.5 bars absolute.) No gas was recovered from equipment rated lower than 
110 kV (Maruyama et al., 2000). In Europe in 1995, gas supply systems for equipment manufacture were usually 
decentralised, and filling tubes were not self-closing. Gas was recovered to approximately 0.05 bars absolute 
during manufacturing and maintenance (Ecofys, 2005).

TIER 2 METHOD 
Emission factors for the Tier 2 method are generally developed on the basis of data collected from representative 
manufacturers and utilities that track emissions by life cycle stage, essentially using the Tier 3, pure mass-
balance method at their facilities for at least one year. (The disposal emission factor should also account for 
emissions that occur downstream of the utility site, as discussed below.) These emissions by life cycle stage are 
then divided by the corresponding SF6 consumption or equipment capacity at that life cycle stage (i.e., SF6 
consumption for manufacturing emissions, total existing equipment capacity for use emissions, and retiring 
Chapter 8: Other Product Manufacture and Use 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
8.17 
equipment capacity for final use and disposal emissions) to develop emission factors. For example, to develop an 
emission factor for manufacturing, total emissions from the survey of manufacturers are summed and then 
divided by the total SF6 consumption of surveyed manufacturers. This emission factor can then be applied to the 
manufacturing sector as a whole, using national SF6 consumption by manufacturers. A similar approach can be 
used to estimate and apply emission factors for equipment use.  
The emission factor for disposal should fully account for three factors: (1) the recovery frequency (the fraction of 
equipment whose charge is recovered), (2) the recovery efficiency (the fraction of charge recovered when 
recovery is performed), and (3) the emissions from recycling and destruction of the recovered gas. The quantities 
in (1) and (2) will be automatically accounted for in emission factors based on use of the Tier 3 mass-balance 
method at representative utilities. However, the quantity in (3) reflects emissions that occur both on site and 
downstream of the utility/user. Thus, it must be accounted for separately. See the Tier 3 Method discussion 
below for guidance on estimating recycling and destruction emission factors.  
The facility-level variant of the Tier 3 approach may also be used to develop emission factors, but these will be 
applied at a more aggregated level, i.e., to equipment manufacturing and use (where the latter includes 
installation, use, and disposal) rather than to each lifecycle stage.  
TIER 3 METHOD 
Because the Tier 3 method encourages the use of emission factors only when emission rates from processes are 
quite low (e.g., 3 percent of nameplate capacity per year or less) or when electrical equipment has only recently 
been introduced into a country, emission factors for this method may be difficult to measure directly using a 
mass-balance approach. To estimate Tier 3 emission factors, therefore, engineering studies may be used, 
identifying potential leak points and loss mechanisms and assigning probabilities and emission rates to these. 
Expected losses from service and maintenance should be factored into overall emission rates, as should losses 
from rare but catastrophic events that result in the loss of most of the equipment’s charge. Past experience with 
similar processes and designs should be considered. To ascertain and verify emission factors for use, surveys of 
equipment in the field may be carried out after several years of use, with the number of years determined by the 
expected leak rate and the limit of detection of the measuring equipment. Manufacturer statistics on equipment 
failure rates should be monitored to help ensure that catastrophic or gradual loss rates are not higher than 
expected. Disposal emissions are extremely sensitive to recovery frequencies (the fraction of equipment whose 
charge is recovered) and to recovery efficiencies (the fraction of charge recovered when recovery is performed, 
which, due to time considerations, may be lower than what is technically achievable). Thus, these should be 
monitored and documented carefully before establishing disposal emission factors.  
Emission factors for recycling of recovered SF6 may be based on professional judgement. Emission factors for 
destruction may be based on the rated destruction efficiency of the destruction technology, assuming that the 
technology is maintained and operated in a way that maintains its rated destruction efficiency. 
8.2.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The activity data necessary to carry out the various estimation methods may be gathered from chemical 
manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, equipment users, and equipment disposers and/or their industry 
associations in the country or the region. The best source(s) of data vary depending upon the method and 
national circumstances.  
TIER 1 METHOD 
SF6 consumption by equipment manufacturers: SF6 consumption by equipment manufacturers can be estimated 
using information from the manufacturers on their purchases of SF6, their returns of SF6 to chemical producers, 
and changes in their inventory of SF6 in containers. If information from equipment manufacturers is unavailable 
or incomplete, information from chemical producers and/or distributors on their sales to equipment 
manufacturers (less any returns) may be used. 
Nameplate capacity of new and retiring equipment: Nameplate capacity can be estimated using one 
or more of the following data sources: (1) information from equipment manufacturers/importers on the total 
nameplate capacity of the equipment they manufacture or import and export, (2) information from utilities on the 
total nameplate capacity of the equipment they install and retire each year, or (3) if information from (1) or (2) is 
not available, information from chemical manufacturers/importers on their sales of SF6 to equipment 
manufacturers. The first two data sources are preferable to the third, because gas sales to equipment 
manufacturers will differ from the nameplate capacity of new equipment installed in the country, particularly if 
equipment imports or exports are significant. In estimating the nameplate capacities of new and retiring 
equipment, inventory compilers should include the nameplate capacity of imported equipment and exclude the 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.18 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
nameplate capacity of exported equipment. (See Section 7.5, Refrigeration, Box 7.1, Accounting for Imports and 
Exports of Refrigerant and Equipment, for a full discussion of how to treat imports and exports in estimating 
these quantities. This guidance is directly applicable to this category.)  
In the case of retiring equipment, capacity or sales information should be historical, starting in the year when the 
current year’s retiring equipment was built. Typical values for the lifetime of electrical equipment range from 30 
to 40 years. If information on the total nameplate capacity of retiring equipment is not available, it can be 
estimated from new nameplate capacity, using the estimated annual growth rate of equipment capacity. In 
estimating the growth rate, it is good practice to consider both the number of pieces of equipment sold each year 
and the average nameplate capacity of the equipment.
3  
The following equation can be used to estimate retiring nameplate capacity, if this information is not available 
directly:  
EQUATION 8.11 
RETIRING NAMEPLATE CAPACITY 
Retiring Nameplate Capacity = New Nameplate Capacity / ( 1 + g )L 
Where: 
L = equipment lifetime 
g = rate of growth 
According to a 2004 global survey, the average annual growth rate of SF6 sales to equipment manufacturers 
between 1970 and 2000 was approximately 9 percent. (Smythe, 2004). In the absence of country-specific 
information, a default factor of 9 percent may be used.  
Total nameplate capacity of installed equipment: The total nameplate capacity of equipment can be 
estimated using the same data sources as are used to estimate the nameplate capacity for new and retiring 
equipment. If data from equipment manufacturers is used, it should include data on sales over the full lifetime of 
the equipment (30 to 40 years).  
TIER 2 METHOD 
Quantities can be estimated as for Tier 1 above. 
TIER 3 METHOD 
To implement the Tier 3 method, information must be gathered at two levels. At the facility level, gas flows 
must be tracked correctly according to the Tier 3 method. At the national level, information from facilities 
(manufacturers, users, and disposers of equipment) must be collected, checked, summed, and if necessary, 
extrapolated to include estimates of emissions from facilities in the country that do not collect data. Guidance 
regarding the information to be tracked by facilities is provided in the descriptions of the Tier 3 method above. 
Gas consumption may be measured by weighing gas cylinders before and after filling or recovery operations or 
at the beginning and end of the year or by using flow meters (e.g., during equipment manufacturing). At the 
national level, trade associations for equipment manufacturers and utilities can be very helpful in disseminating 
knowledge to their members regarding the Tier 3 approach and in helping their members to track and report data 
consistently and transparently. Trade associations can also act as third parties to aggregate confidential or 
sensitive data so that it can be released (in aggregate) to the public. Where trade associations are not active, 
national inventory compilers can facilitate the collection of information at the facility level, as well as the 
reporting and verification of this information, by developing model emission tracking protocols or by adopting 
existing industry protocols that embody the Tier 3 approach. These protocols can then be distributed to the 
manufacturers, users, and disposers of electrical equipment. Electronic protocols such as spreadsheets further 
facilitate the tracking, documentation, and reporting of emissions and minimize opportunities for arithmetic error. 
Because emission rates can vary from region to region and facility to facility, it is good practice to survey as 
many facilities as practical. In addition to manufacturers and utilities, countries should survey industrial sites and 
other non-utility sites if these contribute substantially to emissions from electrical equipment. If the number of 
facilities in a country is large (e.g., over 50), it may be difficult to achieve complete reporting. In these cases, 
countries may estimate emissions from non-reporting facilities by applying the Tier 2 method to these facilities 
                                                           
3  While the number of pieces of equipment sold each year has generally grown, the average nameplate capacity has generally 
declined. 
Chapter 8: Other Product Manufacture and Use 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
8.19 
or by using alternative activity data as described in Chapter 2 of Volume 1, Approaches to Data Collection. 
Sector-specific considerations in selecting and using alternative activity data are discussed below. 
For sealed pressure equipment (which is widely dispersed among industrial users as well as utilities), 
manufacturers and distributors are likely to be the best source of complete information on national bank sizes 
and emission rates. To develop an accurate estimate, inventory compilers should survey manufacturers regarding 
their sales of equipment between the present and the time when currently retiring equipment was installed, or, if 
equipment has not yet begun to be retired, between the present and the time when the equipment was introduced 
into the country.  
Sector-specific considerations in selecting and using alternative activity data 
for Tier 3 
As discussed above, even when implementing a Tier 3 method it may not be possible to obtain data from all 
facilities. To obtain complete coverage of facilities, it is possible to use alternative activity data. For estimating 
emissions from non-reporting manufacturers, it may be possible to use the manufacturing capacity and/or 
collective market share (in terms of functional units) of the non-reporting manufacturers. For estimating 
emissions from non-reporting utilities, possible alternative data sets or drivers include (but are not limited to) the 
length of transmission lines, the combined length of transmission and distribution lines, or the number of 
substations of the non-reporting utilities. Transmission kilometres are likely to be a good predictor of emissions 
where most SF6 is used in high voltage transmission equipment, as in the U.S. (A discussion of how transmission 
kilometres are used to estimate emissions in the U.S. can be found in Volume 1, Chapter 2, Approaches to Data 
Collection.) Where a high percentage of SF6 is used in medium voltage distribution equipment or in gas-
insulated substations, one of the other types of data may be appropriate.  
Wherever alternative data sets are used, it is important to derive emission factors from a representative set of 
facilities to ensure that the resulting estimate of national SF6 emissions is unbiased. Note that more than one 
factor may be appropriate, e.g., for different size utilities or for utilities in urban vs. rural locations. Because SF6 
use and emission patterns can change over time, it is good practice to update the analysis and emission factor(s) 
at least every five years. (For example, emission rates may change as compact and leak-tight equipment replaces 
larger, leakier equipment and as sealed pressure equipment grows in importance.) In some cases, countries may 
be able to make use of emission factors developed in countries with similar electrical grids. In these cases, it is 
good practice to document the similarities between the grids before applying the emission factor from the other 
country.  
8.2.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Completeness for this source category requires accounting for emissions during the manufacture, use, and 
disposal of equipment, and during the recycling or destruction of SF6 recovered from equipment. Where Tier 3 
methods are used, completeness requires that all significant SF6 users (manufacturers and utilities) be identified. 
When facility-level emissions data are not available from all of these users, emission estimates should be 
developed for them using one of the extrapolation methods described in Section 8.2.2.3, Choice of Activity Data. 
In the manufacturing sector, this requires assessing emissions from: 
• 
Manufacture of gas insulated switchgear (GIS), gas circuit breakers (GCB), high voltage gas-insulated lines 
(GIL), outdoor gas-insulated instrument transformers, reclosers, switches, and ring main units of both types 
(sealed and closed pressure systems, respectively up to and above 52 kV), and other equipment including 
but not limited to cast resin instrument transformers and certain types of bushings using SF6 either as gas for 
the casting process or as a blowing agent; 
• 
Manufacturers of gas-insulated power transformers (GIT);  
• 
Minor SF6 users, including equipment remakers and servicing companies;  
• 
The SF6 distribution chain from producers and distributors to manufacturing facilities. 
In the utility and disposal sector, this requires accounting for all SF6 losses associated with: 
• 
New electrical equipment installations; 
• 
Leakage, refill, maintenance, and equipment failures;  
• 
Disposal of discarded electrical equipment;  
• 
Recycling or destruction of SF6 recovered from equipment (but recycling emissions from chemical 
producers should be counted under chemical production, which is covered in Section 3.10 of this volume).

2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
It is good practice to identify and include industrial, military and small-utility applications if these are believed 
to contribute substantially to total emissions from the electrical equipment source category. 
8.2.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
When estimating emissions from equipment users over a time series, it is necessary to consider SF6 emissions 
associated with the full set equipment at users’ sites for the years of interest. Thus, when using approaches based 
on banks and emission-factors (e.g., the Tier 2 approach), countries will require information on the capacity and 
emission rate of equipment purchased and installed for 30 to 40 years preceding the years of interest.  
In the user sector, if historical data are unavailable, good practice is to develop estimates using the top-down 
method, i.e., develop a model based on professional judgement by industry experts and inventory compilers and 
then calibrate as discussed below. Average leak rates for new equipment and the frequency of refill and routine 
maintenance all decreased from 1970 to 1995, and this trend has continued to the present. It is not good practice 
to apply current (post-2000) overall loss rates to historical years. Aggregate loss rates estimated from historical 
sales can be used in this case as well. 
On the manufacturing side, if historical data for developing base year emissions for 1990/1995 are not available, 
the top-down method calibrated to more accurate estimates for current years may be applied. Since SF6 handling 
practices of equipment manufacturers have changed substantially since 1995 (e.g., more gas is recovered), it is 
not good practice to apply current loss rates to historical estimates. Aggregate loss rates determined from global 
and regional sales and emission analyses may assist in providing an unbiased estimate for earlier years. It is good 
practice to recalculate emissions according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5, with all 
assumptions clearly documented. 
8.2.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
When using the Tier 3 method, the resulting emissions estimates will have an accuracy of the order of ± 10 
percent, and are likely to be more accurate than estimates developed using Tier 2 or Tier 1 methods.. If surveys 
are incomplete, the associated uncertainty will be greater. Particular sources of uncertainty may include:  
• 
SF6 exported by equipment manufacturers (either in equipment or separately in containers);  
• 
SF6 imported by foreign equipment manufacturers (either in equipment or in containers); 
• 
SF6 returned to foreign recycling facilities; 
• 
Measurements of mass, density, and pressure (generally accurate to within one or two percent of the total 
quantity massed, but if emission rates are low, this may be a substantial percentage of those rates); 
• 
Emission factors; 
• 
Time lag between emissions and servicing;4  
• 
Lifetime of the equipment;  
• 
Regression error associated with any extrapolative approaches. 
The estimated uncertainties in the default emission factors for the Tier 1 method are shown in Table 8.5, 
Uncertainties for Default Emission Factors for SF6 Emissions from Electrical Equipment. These values are based 
on the variation observed in emission factors in Europe. If the factors in Tables 8.2-8.4 are applied outside the 
countries and/or regions in which they were developed, uncertainties will be greater.

8.2.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
8.2.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, and quality assurance 
procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this 
source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Additional procedures specific to electrical equipment are outlined below: 
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
Inventory compilers should sum the facility-level data used as part of a bottom-up, Tier 3 method and cross-
check the data against national level emissions calculated using country-level data (the Tier 2 method) and/or 
country-level data with the IPCC default emission factors (the Tier 1 method). The Tier 2 method may similarly 
be checked against the Tier 1 method. Countries may also compare their results to those derived using a country-
level mass-balance approach, as described in Equations 7.3 and 7.9 of Chapter 7. If countries do not have 
manufacturing facilities, they may also compare their estimates against potential emissions estimated using 
national apparent consumption data.  
Review of facility-level emissions data 
In all instances where site-specific emissions data are obtained through surveys, inventory compilers should 
compare the emission rates between sites (adjusting for relative size or capacity) to identify significant outliers. 
They should investigate any outliers to determine if the differences can be explained or if there is an error in the 
reported emissions. As noted in Section 8.2.2.3, national inventory compilers can facilitate both the collection 
and verification of information at the facility level by distributing emission tracking protocols that embody the 
Tier 3 approach. Electronic protocols such as spreadsheets are particularly useful, as they minimize opportunities 
for arithmetic error. The calculations included in these protocols (whether electronic or not) can then be checked 
after they are submitted.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.22 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Comparison of emission rates with those of other countries 
Inventory compilers should compare effective emission factors (loss rates) with values reported by other 
countries in the region, or with defaults published in the scientific literature for equipment with a similar design 
and similar level of emissions control. Transparent reporting, as outlined above, is essential for making 
international comparisons. 
8.2.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. 
Some examples of specific documentation and reporting relevant to this source category ensuring transparency 
in reported emissions estimates are provided in Table 8.6, Good Practice Reporting Information for SF6 
Emissions from Electrical Equipment by tier. 
Confidentiality issues may arise where there are limited numbers of manufacturers or utilities. In these cases, 
aggregated reporting for the total electrical equipment sector, or even total national SF6 applications, may be 
necessary. National or regional associations of users and manufacturers may be willing to collect, check, and 
aggregate data, particularly when they have collected such data historically. They can then report the aggregated 
information to the inventory compiler, resolving the problem of confidentiality. If survey responses cannot be 
released as public information, third party review of survey data may be necessary to support data verification 
efforts.

USE OF SF6 AND PFCs IN OTHER PRODUCTS 
8.3.1 
Introduction 
This source category excludes the following source categories that are addressed elsewhere in the 2006 
Guidelines:  
• 
Production of SF6 and PFCs (Section 3.10); 
• 
Production and use of electrical equipment (Section 8.2); 
• 
Primary and secondary production of magnesium and aluminium (Chapter 4); and 
•

(Airborne Warning and Control System), and PFCs used as heat transfer fluids in high-powered electronic 
applications;

• 
‘Adiabatic’ applications utilising the low permeability through rubber of SF6 and some PFCs, e.g., car tires 
and sport shoe soles;  
• 
SF6 used in sound-proof windows; 
• 
PFCs used as heat transfer fluids in commercial and consumer applications; 
• 
PFCs used in cosmetics and in medical applications; 
• 
Other uses e.g. gas-air tracer in research and leak detectors. 
8.3.2 
Methodological issues 
8.3.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
The good practice method is to use either consumption data from users of SF6 or PFCs or top-down import, 
export and consumption data from national SF6 producers and distributors, disaggregated by major type of SF6 or 
PFC application. Acquiring this data will entail a survey of all producers and distributors of SF6 and PFCs to 
identify total net SF6 and PFC consumption. Once the data are obtained, the amount of SF6 and PFC consumed 
by application in this source category should be estimated. 
 
MILITARY APPLICATIONS 
SF6 EMISSIONS FROM OPERATION OF AWACS 
SF6 is used as an insulating medium in the radar systems of military reconnaissance planes of the Boeing E-3A 
type, commonly known as AWACS. The purpose of the SF6 is to prevent electric flashovers in the hollow 
conductors of the antenna, in which high voltages of more than 135 kV prevail. When the plane ascends, SF6 is 
automatically released from the system and into the atmosphere to maintain the appropriate pressure difference 
between the system and the outside air. When the plane descends, SF6 is automatically charged into the system 
from an SF6 container on board. Most emissions occur during the pressure-balancing process on ascent, but 
emissions from system leakage can also occur during other phases of flight or during time on the ground. Annual 
emissions per plane have been estimated to be 740 kg, while the charge of each system is approximately 13 kg.

Tier 1 method – SF6 emissions per plane 
If a country does not have data on SF6 consumption by its AWACS, it may use a per-plane emission factor to 
estimate emissions. An emission factor of 740 kg per plane per year is presented in Table 8.7 below; this figure 
is based on estimates of SF6 emissions from NATO Boeing E-3As. Note that actual emissions per plane are 
strongly influenced by the average number of sorties (take-offs) per plane per year. More frequent sorties will 
raise the emission rate above 740 kg/plane; less frequent sorties will lower it. Leakage rates during flight or 
during time on the ground will also affect the emission rate.

Tier 2 method – user mass-balance method 
The most accurate method for estimating SF6 emissions from AWACS is to track SF6 consumption by the 
systems. To do so, the following equations, which are similar to the utility-level variant of the Tier 3 method for 
electrical equipment, may be used. Note that for AWACS, acquisitions and disbursements of SF6 containers are 
likely to be considerably more important to the result than acquisitions and retirements of operating systems. 
EQUATION 8.13 
EMISSIONS FROM AWACS (USER MASS-BALANCE) 
User Emissions = Decrease in SF6 Inventory + Acquisitions of SF6 – Disbursements of SF6 – Net

Where: 
Decrease in SF6 Inventory = SF6 stored in containers at the beginning of the year – SF6 stored in 
containers at the end of the year  
Acquisitions of SF6 = SF6 purchased from chemical producers or distributors in bulk + SF6 purchased 
from AWACS manufacturers or distributors with or inside of new planes + SF6 returned to site after 
off-site recycling 
Disbursements of SF6 = SF6 contained in AWACS that are transferred to other entities + SF6 returned to 
suppliers + SF6 sent off-site for recycling + SF6 destroyed 
Net Increase in AWACS Fleet Charge = 13 kg • (New AWACS – Retiring AWACS)  
 
SF6 AND PFC EMISSIONS FROM OTHER MILITARY APPLICATIONS 
There is wide range of military applications using PFCs or SF6.5 Military electronics are believed to be an 
important and growing application of PFC heat transfer fluids, which are valued for their stability and dielectric 
properties. The fluids are used in ground and airborne radar (klystrons), avionics, missile guidance systems, 
ECM (Electronic Counter Measures), sonar, amphibious assault vehicles, other surveillance aircraft, lasers, SDI 
(Strategic Defense Initiative), and stealth aircraft. PFCs may also be used to cool electric motors, particularly in 
applications where noise reduction is valued, e.g., in ships and submarines. The specific PFCs used in these 
applications are believed to be similar to those identified as heat transfer fluids in electronics manufacturing in 
Chapter 6. Spray cooling, jet impingement cooling, and pool boiling appear to be the favoured systems for heat 
removal. In all of these cooling applications, the PFC is contained in a closed system, and neither replacement 
nor replenishment of the PFC liquid appears to be required. Thus, the greatest opportunities for emissions are the 
manufacture, maintenance, and, especially, the disposal of the equipment. 
SF6 is used in high-performance ground and airborne radar systems in their hollow conductors for transmission 
of high-frequency energy pulses at high voltages from the klystron. Another application of SF6 is as an oxidant 
of lithium in Stored Chemical Energy Propulsion System (SCEPS), e.g., in naval torpedoes and in infrared 
decoys (Koch, 2004). Apparently, these applications of SF6, like those of the PFC heat transfer fluids 
enumerated above, are generally more or less enclosed, but servicing and testing procedures may lead to 
emission. The use of SF6 for the quieting of torpedo propellers has also been reported (NIST, 1997). 
In addition, SF6 may be emitted as a by-product of the processing of nuclear material for the production of fuel 
and nuclear warheads. SF6 is known to be emitted from neutralising excess fluorine during the production of 
nuclear fuel for civilian applications (AREVA, 2005).

Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.26 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Although it is believed that the total amounts of SF6 and PFCs consumed and emitted in this sector may be 
significant, no data on quantities are publicly available so far. Therefore, inventory compilers should try to 
collect further information from the relevant authorities and, if possible, their suppliers. As noted above, the 
greatest opportunities for emissions from many of these applications appear to be the manufacture, maintenance, 
and disposal of the equipment. Thus, if inventory compilers can acquire information on emission rates during the 
manufacture, maintenance, and disposal of the equipment, along with the quantities of equipment manufactured, 
in use, and disposed, they can use the Tier 2 or Tier 3 method for electrical equipment to estimate emissions. For 
applications with different emissions profiles (e.g., prompt emissions), the appropriate equation from Section 8.2 
may be used.  
 
SF6 EMISSIONS FROM UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH PARTICLE 
ACCELERATORS  
SF6 is used in university and research operated particle accelerators as an insulating gas. Typically, high voltage 
equipment is contained and operated within a vessel filled with SF6 at a pressure exceeding atmospheric pressure. 
Charges range from five kilograms to over ten thousand kilograms, with typical charges falling between 500 and 
3 000 kg. When the equipment requires maintenance, the SF6 is transferred into storage tanks. SF6 losses occur 
primarily during gas recovery and transfer, when pressure relief valves are actuated, and through slow leaks. 
Based on two recent studies annual SF6 losses range between 5 and 7 percent of vessel capacity per year and 
generally depend on the vessel opening frequency plus the efficiency of the recovery and transfer equipment. 
World banked capacity is roughly estimated to be 500 tonnes with annual SF6 emissions of 35 tonnes.  
Switzerland has developed a voluntary program to reduce SF6 emissions from particle accelerators. Suggestions 
and techniques for reducing SF6 emissions from these sources exist.

Tier 1 method – country-level method 
In cases where individual user accelerator charge data is unavailable, one extremely rough method involves 
determining the total number of university and research particle accelerators in the country and using several 
factors to determine the country-level annual emission rate as noted in Equation 8.14. For this Tier 1 method, the 
only data that requires collection is the total number of university and research particle accelerators in the given 
country. 
EQUATION 8.14 
UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH PARTICLE ACCELERATOR EMISSIONS (COUNTRY-LEVEL) 
Emissions = (Number of university and research particle accelerators in the country) • (SF6 Use

Where: 
Number of university and research particle accelerators in the country = The total number of university 
and research particle accelerators in the country. This rough method does not require countries to 
determine the number of accelerators that use SF6. To determine if a country has a particle 
accelerator, go to http://www-elsa.physik.uni-bonn.de/Informationen/accelerator_list.html 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.28 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
SF6 Use Factor = 0.33 Approximately one third of university and research particle accelerators use SF6 as 
an insulator. 
SF6 Charge Factor = 2400 kg, SF6, the average SF6 charge in a university and research particle 
accelerator. 
SF6 university and research particle accelerator Emission Factor = 0.07, the average annual university 
and research particle accelerator emission rate as a fraction of the total charge.  
Tier 2 method – accelerator-level emission-factor approach 
If data on the quantity of SF6 contained within each university and research accelerator are available, a default 
emission factor of 7 percent may be multiplied by the total SF6 charge contained in university and research 
accelerators in the country. The total country SF6 emission rate from university and research accelerators is 
therefore calculated from Equation 8.15.

Individual User Accelerator Charges = SF6 contained within each university and research accelerator. 
Tier 3 method –accelerator-level mass-balance method 
SF6 emissions from university and research facilities operating particle accelerators may be most accurately 
determined at the user level on an accelerator-by-accelerator basis. Emission calculations are estimated by 
tracking accelerator charge as well as SF6 consumption and disposal. As detailed in Equation 8.16, the total 
emissions are equal to the sum of the individual users’ emissions. Note, under this method, as the overall SF6 
emission rate from particle accelerators is small compared to other SF6 uses, the associated SF6 lost in 
manufacturing is considered negligible and is not included in the calculation.

SF6 EMISSIONS FROM INDUSTRIAL AND MEDICAL PARTICLE 
ACCELERATORS  
SF6 is used as an insulating gas in two types of industrial particle accelerators (low and high voltage) and also in 
medical (cancer therapy) particle accelerators, as is the case for university and research particle accelerators. 
However, the emission and charge factors for industrial and medical particle accelerators are different from those 
of university and research accelerators, as discussed below. 
Global banked capacity for industrial particle accelerators is roughly estimated to be 500 tonnes with annual SF6 
emissions of 35 tonnes. Global banked capacity for medical (radiotherapy) particle accelerators is roughly 
estimated to be less than 5 tonnes with annual SF6 emissions of less than 5 tonnes. (Schwarz, 2005).

Tier 3 method – user-level mass-balance method 
To calculate SF6 emissions from industrial and medical particle accelerators, use the same Tier 3 method as the 
university and research facilities. The customer service organisations for manufacturers and distributors of the 
equipment are likely to have information on equipment stocks, imports, and exports, and on the quantities of SF6 
used to fill and refill the equipment.

EMISSIONS FROM OTHER APPLICATIONS OF SF6 AND PFCs  
It is good practice to contact all gas producers/distributors to identify SF6 and PFC users and to investigate the 
gas consumption of source categories other than those mentioned above. The key difference among the 
applications discussed below is the typical delay between the purchase of the SF6 or PFC and the release of the 
chemical. In some cases (e.g., SF6 used in sound-proof glazing, PFCs used as heat transfer fluids), the chemical 
is fairly well contained during the life of the equipment or product, and most emissions are associated with the 
manufacture and disposal of the product. In these cases, the delay between the purchase of the chemical and its 
final emission depends on the lifetime of the product, ranging from three years for tyres and sport-shoes to 25 
years for sound-proof glazing. In other cases (e.g., use of SF6 and PFCs as tracers or in medical applications), the 
chemical is fully emitted within a year of its purchase. If, as a result of an initial survey, applications with 
distinctive delayed emissions appear significant, then good practice is to use a source category-specific emission 
calculation, taking into account the delay in emissions. 
Adiabatic uses 
Adiabatic uses of SF6 and some PFCs exploit the low permeability of these gases through rubber.  Historically, 
SF6 has been the dominant gas in these applications; however, PFCs with similar molecular weights (such as 
C3F8) have recently been used as well. Applications with a delay period of 3 years include or car tyres, sport 
shoe soles and tennis balls (Schwarz et al., 1996). For applications with emissions that are delayed by three years, 
the following formula can be used. 
EQUATION 8.19 
ADIABATIC PROPERTY APPLICATIONS 
Emissions in year t = Sales in year (t – 3) 
 
Sound-proof glazing 
Double-glazed sound-proof windows: Approximately one-third of the total amount of SF6 purchased is released 
during assembly (i.e., filling of the double glass window) (Schwarz/Leisewitz, 1999). For the stock of gas 
remaining inside the window (capacity), an annual leakage rate of 1 percent is assumed (including glass 
breakage). Thus, about 75 percent of initial stock remains at the end of its 25-year lifetime. The application of 
SF6 in windows began in 1975, so disposal is only beginning to occur. Emissions from this source sub-category 
should be calculated using Equations 8.20 to 8.22:  
EQUATION 8.20 
DOUBLE-GLAZED WINDOWS: ASSEMBLY 
Assembly Emissions in year t = 0.33 • SF6 purchased to fill windows assembled in year t 
 
EQUATION 8.21 
DOUBLE-GLAZED WINDOWS: USE 
Leakage Emissions in year t = 0.01 • Capacity of Existing Windows in year t 
 
EQUATION 8.22 
DOUBLE-GLAZED WINDOWS: DISPOSAL 
Disposal Emissions in year t = Amount Left in Window at End of Lifetime in year t • (1 – 
Recovery Factor) 
 
Unless country-specific data are available, a default recovery factor value of zero should be assumed in Equation 
8.22. If no specific information is available for these sub-source categories, good practice is to treat them as 
prompt emissions. 
 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.32 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
PFCs used as heat transfer fluids in consumer and commercial applications 
PFCs are used as heat transfer fluids in a number of high-power-density commercial and consumer electronic 
applications. Commercial applications include cooling for supercomputer, telecommunication, and airport radar 
systems, as well as drive units (rectifiers) on high-speed trains (Burton, 2006). These applications consume much 
smaller volumes of liquid PFCs than electronics manufacturing, but are believed to be significant among ‘niche’ 
applications. Consumer applications include cooling kits for desktop computers that are operated at high voltages 
to increase their processing speed. The specific PFCs used in these applications are believed to be similar to 
those identified as heat transfer fluids in electronics manufacturing in Chapter 6. In all of these applications, the 
liquid PFCs are used in closed modules, indicating that most emissions occur during the manufacture, 
maintenance, and disposal of the product or equipment. Thus, if inventory compilers can acquire information on 
emission rates during the manufacture, maintenance, and disposal of the equipment, along with the quantities of 
equipment manufactured, used, and disposed each year, they can use the Tier 2 or Tier 3 method for electrical 
equipment to estimate emissions. For applications with different emissions profiles (e.g., prompt emissions), the 
appropriate equation from Section 8.2 may be used. 
PFCs used in cosmetic and medical applications 
PFCs with relatively large molecular weights (e.g., C10F18) are used in cosmetic and medical applications, 
exploiting their ability to carry oxygen to living tissue (May, 2006). Cosmetic applications include anti-wrinkle 
creams and are estimated to consume fairly small amounts. Current and potential medical applications include 
storage of pancreatic tissue for transplants (using the ‘two-layer method’), eye surgery (to repair retinal tears), 
pneumonectomy (lung therapy and diagnosis), use as a contrast agent in ultrasonic and MRI examinations, blood 
extension, wound healing, and treatment of diseases of the middle ear. All but the first two medical applications 
involve only small quantities and/or are at the research stage. Storage of pancreatic tissue is a small but growing 
application. Emissions from medical uses are uncertain but are believed to be small. 
In all of these applications, the PFC is believed to be emitted into the atmosphere within one year of its purchase. 
Thus, emissions from these sources can be estimated using Equation 8.23 for prompt emissions.  
Any other uses of SF6 and PFCs 
Other applications for SF6 and PFCs that are not specifically addressed above include their use as tracers (in leak 
detection, indoor and outdoor tracking of air-masses, and oil recovery6) and use of SF6 in the production of 
optical cables (for fluorodoping of glass fibres7). Often the gases or liquids are emitted within one year of 
purchase. In this case, good practice in calculating SF6 and PFC emissions from these ‘prompt’ emissive 
applications is to use the following formula: 
EQUATION 8.23 
PROMPT EMISSIONS 
Emissions in year t = (0.5 • Amount Sold in year t) + (0.5 • Amount Sold in year t – 1) 
 
This equation is similar to the equation for prompt ODS Substitute applications (e.g., aerosols and solvents) 
addressed in Chapter 7 of this volume. The equation covers more than one year because both sales and emissions 
are assumed to be continuous over the year; that is, chemical sold in the middle of year t-1 is not fully emitted 
until the middle of year t. 
8.3.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
For ‘other’ source categories of SF6 and PFCs that contribute substantially to a country’s SF6 and PFCs 
emissions, countries are encouraged to develop country-specific emission factors based on occasional surveys of 
representative subsets of sources. It is good practice to clearly document such emission factors. Default emission 
factors are provided above for AWACS, accelerators, prompt emissive applications and adiabatic applications, 
including windows.  
                                                           
6  D. Vlachogiannis et al. (2005). This paper indicated that some fraction of injected PFCs and SF6 was destroyed during fuel 
combustion, but the magnitude of this fraction (compared to the fraction of injected chemical that escaped before 
combustion) was unclear.

Chapter 8: Other Product Manufacture and Use 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
8.33 
8.3.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
The activity data for these sub-source categories should be consistent with the data used in the calculation of SF6 
emissions from other source categories (e.g., electrical equipment) to ensure that the estimate is complete and 
there is no double counting. For medical linear accelerators, the customer service organisations for 
manufacturers and distributors of the equipment are likely to have information on equipment stocks, imports, and 
exports, and on the quantities of SF6 used to fill and refill the equipment. Guidance regarding possible sources of 
activity data for other sources is provided under the method for each source category. 
8.3.2.4 
COMPLETENESS  
Data per application on import, export and consumption from national SF6 and PFC producers and distributors 
will suffice, provided that (i) all SF6 and PFC producers and distributors are identified, (ii) domestic consumers 
only purchase SF6 and PFCs from national suppliers, and (iii) imports and exports in products (e.g., sport 
attributes) are negligible. It is good practice to check regularly for additional distributors to ensure that no gas is 
imported directly (in bulk) by end-users and that identified products containing SF6 or PFCs are not imported in 
sizeable amounts. 
Alternatively, if top-down data on chemical consumption is not available, countries may use information on the 
number of accelerators, AWACS, windows, etc. in use in the country, applying the emission factors that are 
supplied in the method for each source category. 
8.3.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
For base year estimates, data may be needed for a few years prior to the base year; one year for prompt 
emissions and more years for delayed emission applications. It is good practice to calculate emissions using the 
same method for every year in the time series. Where data are unavailable to support a more rigorous method for 
all years in the time series, it is good practice to recalculate according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, 
Chapter 5. 
8.3.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
If the survey of domestic sales per application by national gas producers and distributors is complete, then the 
accuracy of annual apparent consumption data will be high. The uncertainty in emissions estimates will be 
similarly small when the uses are all prompt emissions. In case of delayed emission applications, the 
uncertainties are: 
• 
Default delay times in adiabatic property applications: 3±1 year; 
• 
Defaults for soundproof windows: 50±10% filling emissions and 1±0.5% leakage/breach emissions. 
If gas consumption data are not available, uncertainties regarding the numbers and usage of accelerators and 
AWACS, etc. become important. 
• 
For accelerators, the total SF6 charge and leak rate determine emissions and associated uncertainty 
• 
For use of SF6 in AWACS, the number of sorties per plane has a significant impact on emissions and 
uncertainty. 
8.3.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
8.3.4.1 
QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6, and an expert review of 
the emissions estimates. Additional quality control checks as outlined in Volume 1, and quality assurance 
procedures may also be applicable, particularly if higher tier methods are used to determine emissions from this 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.34 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
source category. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Additional procedures specific to other sources of SF6 are outlined below:  
Comparison of emissions estimates using different approaches 
Inventory compilers should compare total national potential SF6 and PFC emissions (minus the amount allocated 
to the source categories as per chapters 3.10, 4, 6 and 8.2) to the estimated SF6 and PFC emissions from other 
uses. These adjusted potential national emissions can be used as an upper bound on emissions.  
Activity data check 
Inventory compilers should compare the activity data submitted by different producers and distributors, and, 
adjusting for relative size or capacity of the companies, identify significant outliers. Any outliers should be 
investigated to determine if the differences can be explained or if there is an error in the reported activity. 
Comparison of emission rates with those of other countries 
Inventory compilers should compare the emissions from other SF6 and PFC end-uses included in the national 
inventory with information submitted by other similar countries. For each source, emissions per capita or per 
unit of GDP should be compared with the corresponding emission rates of other countries. If national figures 
appear to be relatively very high or very small, a justification should be provided.  
8.3.4.2 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Section 6.11. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. 
For transparency, it is good practice to report both actual and potential emissions from the source category ‘other 
uses’ separately from other SF6 and PFC emissions. In addition, providing information on the specific 
applications that are included in this source category is useful for comparing (estimates of) national practices 
with other countries, regionally, or globally. In addition, the methods applied and references should be 
documented. For delayed emission sub-source categories, annual emissions, delay times and emission factors per 
type of sub-source category should be reported.

N2O FROM PRODUCT USES 
8.4.1 
Introduction 
Evaporative emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) can arise from various types of product use, including: 
• 
Medical applications (anaesthetic use, analgesic use and veterinary use); 
• 
Use as a propellant in aerosol products, primarily in food industry (pressure-packaged whipped cream, etc); 
• 
Oxidising agent and etchant used in semiconductor manufacturing; 
• 
Oxidising agent used, with acetylene, in atomic absorption spectrometry; 
• 
Production of sodium azide, which is used to inflate airbags; 
• 
Fuel oxidant in auto racing; and 
• 
Oxidising agent in blowtorches used by jewelers and others. 
In general, medical applications and use as a propellant in aerosol products are likely to be larger sources than 
others. It is good practice to estimate and report N2O emissions from these sources. Inventory compilers are 
encouraged to estimate and report N2O emissions from the other sources as well, if data are available. 
MEDICAL APPLICATIONS 
Anaesthetic use of N2O 
N2O for anaesthetic use is supplied in steel cylinders containing a minimum of 98 percent N2O. N2O is used 
during anaesthesia for two reasons: a) as an anaesthetic and analgesic and as b) a carrier gas for volatile 
fluorinated hydrocarbon anaesthetics such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. The anaesthetic effect of 
N2O is additive to that of the fluorinated hydrocarbon agents.  
Not all anaesthetics require the use of N2O, and the use of N2O is contra-indicated in a small number of medical 
situations. The carrier gas during anaesthesia may be either N2O and oxygen or a mixture of air and oxygen, in 
which case N2O is avoided. 
Inhaled anaesthetic agents are increasingly administered via breathing systems which re-circulate the exhaled 
breath of the patient through a canister of carbon dioxide absorbent before directing the gases back to the patient. 
Using this method the flow of carrier gas can be reduced considerably after the first few minutes of anaesthesia 
when uptake by the patient is high. This technique is known as Low Flow Anaesthesia. Low Flow Anaesthesia 
has the advantage of reducing emissions as well as reducing cost. 
Some anaesthetics may avoid both N2O and the fluorinated hydrocarbon agents completely by employing a 
technique in which an anaesthetic drug is continuously infused into a vein throughout the surgical procedure. 
This technique is known as Total Intravenous Anaesthesia. 
Analgesic use of N2O 
Inhaled N2O is used to provide pain relief in certain situations. For example, it is supplied in steel cylinders 
containing pre-mixed N2O 50 percent and oxygen 50 percent as premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen mixtures in 
the UK. Premixed nitrous oxide and oxygen mixtures are used to provide pain relief in childbirth, and for painful 
procedures of short duration, e.g. for dressings to be changed in burns patients. Premixed nitrous oxide and 
oxygen mixtures are not used in countries with a very cold climate because the mixture can separate if the 
cylinders are stored below –6 degrees centigrade, with the consequent risk of administering pure nitrous oxide to 
patients with no oxygen. 
Veterinary use of N2O 
N2O is also used during animal anaesthesia. Administration methods are similar to those used in human 
anaesthesia.  
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.36 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
USE AS A PROPELLANT IN AEROSOL PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY IN FOOD 
INDUSTRY 
N2O is also used as a propellant in aerosol products primarily in food industry. Typical usage is to make whipped 
cream, where cartridges filled with N2O are used to blow the cream into foam. 
8.4.2 
Methodological issues 
8.4.2.1 
CHOICE OF METHOD 
It is good practice to estimate N2O emissions from data of quantity of N2O supplied that are obtained from 
manufacturers and distributors of N2O products according to Equation 8.24 below. There will be a time delay 
between manufacture, delivery and use but this is probably small in the case of medical applications because 
hospitals normally receive frequent deliveries to avoid maintaining large stores. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
assume that the N2O products supplied will be used in one year. In the case of use as a propellant in aerosol 
products, there is no reliable data that prove there is a significant time delay between manufacture, delivery and 
use. Such being the case, it is considered practical to assume that the N2O products supplied will be used in one 
year. Equation 8.24 covers more than one year because both supply and use are assumed to be continuous over 
the year; that is, N2O supplied in the middle of year t–1 is not fully used and emitted until the middle of year t. 
Different tiers could not be defined for this source category, because there is no other reliable estimation method. 
For example, in the case of medical applications, estimations from numbers of anaesthetics given, number of 
surgical beds or hours of anaesthesia could be considered but these methods are likely to be inaccurate. (See 
Section 8.4.2.3, Choice of Activity Data.)

8.4.2.2 
CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
MEDICAL APPLICATIONS 
It is assumed that none of the administered N2O is chemically changed by the body, and all is returned to the 
atmosphere. It is reasonable to assume an emission factor of 1.0. 
USE AS A PROPELLANT IN AEROSOL PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY IN FOOD 
INDUSTRY 
For N2O used as a propellant in pressurized and aerosol food products, none of the N2O is reacted during the 
process and all of the N2O is emitted to the atmosphere resulting in an emissions factor of 1.0 for this source. 
OTHERS 
For the other types of product use, it may not be appropriate to assume an emissions factor of 1.0. In case the 
inventory compilers estimate and report N2O emissions arising from product use other than medical applications 
and use as a propellant in aerosol products, they are encouraged to derive reasonable emission factors for that 
source from literature or measurements. 
Chapter 8: Other Product Manufacture and Use 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
8.37 
8.4.2.3 
CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
MEDICAL APPLICATIONS 
Total quantity of N2O supplied by application type should be obtained from manufacturers and distributors of 
N2O products. Alternatively, for medical applications, quantity of N2O usage may be obtained from the 
pharmacy department in individual hospitals that usually have records of the number and capacity of nitrous 
oxide cylinders purchased per annum. 
The duration of hospital stay following a surgical procedure varies considerably from less than one day to 
several days or weeks. Estimates of the number of anaesthetics administered which are calculated from the 
surgical bed occupancy are likely to be inaccurate. 
Because N2O is used in only a proportion of anaesthetics its use cannot be estimated reliably from the number of 
anaesthetics given.  
The flow of N2O (L/min) delivered by the anaesthetic apparatus may be varied by the anaesthetist during the 
course of surgery, typically between zero and 6 L/min. Because of this considerable variability, estimates of 
consumption based on duration of anaesthesia are likely to be inaccurate. 
The proportion of anaesthetics in which N2O is used varies between countries and between individual 
anaesthetists in a given country. Over the recent years there appears to be a general reduction in the proportion of 
anaesthetics which incorporate N2O but data are sparse. 
USE AS A PROPELLANT IN AEROSOL PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY IN FOOD 
INDUSTRY 
Total quantity of N2O supplied by application type should be obtained from manufacturers and distributors of 
N2O products. 
8.4.2.4 
COMPLETENESS 
Data per application on import, export and consumption from national N2O manufacturers and distributors will 
suffice, provided that (i) all N2O manufacturers and distributors are identified, (ii) domestic consumers only 
purchase N2O from national suppliers, and (iii) imports and exports in products (e.g. sport attributes) are 
negligible. It is good practice to check regularly for additional distributors to ensure that no N2O is imported 
directly (in bulk) by end users and that identified products containing N2O are not imported in sizeable amounts. 
8.4.2.5 
DEVELOPING A CONSISTENT TIME SERIES 
It is good practice to calculate emissions of N2O using the same method for every year in the time series. Where 
data are unavailable to support a more rigorous method for all years in the time series, it is good practice to 
recalculate according to the guidance provided in Volume 1, Chapter 5. 
8.4.3 
Uncertainty assessment 
8.4.3.1 
EMISSION FACTOR UNCERTAINTIES 
In the published literature it is widely assumed that none of the N2O inhaled by a patient during anaesthesia is 
metabolised. N2O is taken up continuously from the lungs as dissolved N2O in blood. The portion which is not 
taken up is exhaled in the next breath. Uptake by the patient is high initially and falls progressively in a near-
exponential fashion over time. It is reasonable to assume that all the administered N2O is eventually returned to 
the atmosphere and the emission factor is 1.0. This is a pragmatic assumption because there are no reliable data. 
Any error in the emission factor is likely to be extremely small in comparison with other uncertainties. 
Also in the case of use as a propellant in aerosol products, N2O is not likely to be reacted during the process. 
Therefore, it is a pragmatic assumption that emission factor is 1.0, and any error in the emission factor is likely 
to be extremely small in comparison with other uncertainties. 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use 
8.38 
2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
In case the inventory compilers estimate and report N2O emissions arising from product use other than medical 
applications and use as a propellant in aerosol products, emission factor uncertainties may need to be carefully 
considered. 
8.4.3.2 
ACTIVITY DATA UNCERTAINTIES 
The uncertainties in quantity of N2O supplied by application type obtained from manufacturers and distributors 
of N2O products may vary widely from country to country. If the uncertainty estimates are obtainable from the 
manufacturers and distributors, those estimates should be used. Otherwise, activity data uncertainties should be 
estimated by expert judgement. 
8.4.4 
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC), 
Reporting and Documentation 
It is good practice to document and archive all information required to produce the national emissions inventory 
estimates as outlined in Volume 1, Chapter 6. It is not practical to include all documentation in the national 
inventory report. However, the inventory should include summaries of methods used and references to source 
data such that the reported emissions estimates are transparent and steps in their calculation may be retraced. 
For transparency, providing information on the specific applications that are included in this source category is 
useful for comparing (estimates of) national practices with other countries, regionally, or globally. In addition, 
the methods applied and references should be documented.  
It is good practice to conduct quality control checks and quality assurance procedures as outlined in Volume 1, 
Chapter 6. Inventory compilers are encouraged to use higher tier QA/QC for key categories as identified in 
Volume 1, Chapter 4. 
Additional procedures specific to this source category are outlined below: 
Activity data check 
Inventory compilers should compare the activity data submitted by different manufacturers and distributors of 
N2O, and, adjusting for relative size or capacity of the companies, to identify significant outliers. Any outliers 
should be investigated to determine if the differences can be explained or if there is an error in the reported 
activity. 
Comparison of emissions with other countries 
Inventory compilers should compare the N2O emissions from types of product use included in the national 
inventory with information submitted by other similar countries. For each source, emissions per capita or per 
unit of GDP with other countries should be compared. If national figures appear to be relatively very high or 
very small, a justification should be provided.

Annex 8A 
Examples of Tier 3 national SF6 inventory 
systems 
Figures 8A.1 and 8A.2 illustrate the Tier 3 Hybrid approach as it is currently applied in Germany for closed 
pressure (high voltage) and sealed-pressure (medium voltage) equipment (Schwarz, 2006). In the diagram, ‘MB’ 
indicates processes or life cycle stages for which the mass-balance approach is used, while ‘EF’ indicates 
processes and life cycle stages for which emission factors are used. For example, in manufacturing, the mass-
balance approach is used to estimate emissions from the filling of gas-insulated switchgear, while emission 
factors are used to estimate emissions from the filling of bushings, instrument transformers, and circuit breakers. 
In Germany, the latter processes have emission rates of 1 percent or less, making emissions difficult to measure 
using mass-balance methods. Note that this diagram is intended to be an example only; when implementing the 
Tier 3 approach, countries are encouraged to choose approaches and emission factors appropriate to their 
national circumstances.
