6.1
Introduction
This module provides methodologies for estimating emissions of methane
(CH4) from solid waste disposal sites, CH4 emissions from wastewater
handling and N2O from human sewage.
6.2
Land Disposal of Solid Waste
This section covers estimation of methane emissions from solid waste
disposal sites.
6 . 2 . 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n
Anaerobic decomposition of organic matter by methanogenic bacteria in
solid waste disposal sites results in the release of CH4 to the atmosphere.
This source is estimated to account for about 5 to 20 per cent of global
anthropogenic CH4 emissions (US EPA, 1994; IPCC, 1992).
The methodology provides a classification of ‘solid waste disposal site’
(SWDSs) into “managed” and “unmanaged” sites through a knowledge of
the extent and type of active site management carried out.  The
classification is used to apply a methane correction factor (MCF) to account
for the methane generation potential of the site.
6 . 2 . 2 D a t a  S o u r c e s
Countries are encouraged to use their own data where available.  Default
values, given in the tables, should be used when such data are not available.
Population statistics: Countries that include areas where no organised
waste collection or disposal takes place (usually rural areas) should use
values for the urban population only, when asked to provide population
data.  Waste in rural areas is typically scattered on the land rather than in
SWDSs and hence it tends to decay aerobically generating extremely low, if
any, CH4 emissions.
Waste statistics: Data on Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) generation rates
and on the percentage of MSW disposed to SWDSs are available for many
countries, and these should be used when available.  Default values are given
in Table 6-1.
The different waste types that are here included in MSW are:
1 Household Waste;
2 Yard/Garden Waste; and
3 Commercial/Market Waste
In some countries, significant quantities of organic industrial solid waste is
generated.  The default values provided in Table 6-1 should not include

industrial solid waste.  If a significant quantity of organic industrial solid
waste  is generated and disposed of in SWDSs, care should be taken to
determine the appropriate per capita solid waste generation rate and
Degradable Organic Carbon value.
The Degradable Organic Carbon (DOC) content of the waste is here
defined as the carbon content of paper and textiles; garden and park waste
and other (non-food) putrescibles; food waste; and other organic
biodegradable waste.  DOC content may be determined by one of three
methods:
• By using your own national data;
• By calculation from a knowledge of your country's waste composition
and using the default DOC values given in Table 6-3 for each type of
waste; or
• By using the default values given in Table 6-1.
Note that values given in Tables 6-1 and 6-3 are, in general, for wet (or
fresh) waste.
It is critical that the DOC value corresponds to the waste generation/
disposal rate on which the methane estimate is based.  For example, a
country that includes industrial waste in its MSW estimate should ensure
that the DOC value used reflects this component of the waste stream.
Categories of waste disposal sites: Sites are classified as managed or
unmanaged SWDSs.  A managed solid waste disposal site must have
controlled placement of waste (i.e., waste directed to specific deposition
areas, a degree of control of scavenging and a degree of control of fires)
and will include at least one of the following: cover material; mechanical
compacting; or levelling of the waste.  All other solid waste disposal sites
that do not fall into the above category are defined as unmanaged sites.
Unmanaged sites are further divided as deep (≥5m depth) or shallow (<5m
depth), to allow for their CH4 generation potential.
The methodology requires countries to provide data or estimates of the
quantity of waste that is disposed to each of the three categories of
SWDSs.  It is acknowledged that some countries may find it difficult to
provide this information.  In such cases, Guidelines users are encouraged to
consult with national waste experts to come to a reasoned consensus on
the status of waste management in a country.
Note that the information requires data on the quantity (mass) of waste
deposited in each of the categories, and not the number of waste disposal
sites in each of the categories.  If the breakdown of waste in each category
is not known, the default value given in Table 6-1 should be used.

on:

the amount of waste deposited in the different categories of
SWDSs;

way that CH4 emissions are extremely low.  Enter this value (number of
persons) into column A.
2 Enter the Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Generation Rate (in
kg/capita/day) into column B.
  
MSW is here defined as:
 • household waste;
 • yard/garden waste; and
 • commercial/market waste.
 
If your country MSW contains significant quantities of other organic
waste, such as industrial organic solid waste, then care should be taken
to select an appropriate per capita waste generation rate.
 
You should provide your own data if available.  Default values (for MSW
as defined above) for some specific countries are given in Table 6-1.
3 Multiply the value in column A with the value in column B.  Multiply the
result by 365 to convert from the daily rate to give the Annual Amount
of MSW Generated.  Divide the total by 106 to convert kg to Gg and
enter the result in column C.
4 Enter the Fraction of MSW Disposed of to SWDSs into column D.  Use
your own data if available, otherwise use the default values that are given
in Table 6-1.
5 Multiply the value in column C by the value in column D to give the
Total Annual MSW Disposed to SWDSs.  Enter the result in gigagrams
of MSW in column E.
6 Enter the figure from column E into column A of the main Worksheet
(Worksheet 6-1).
 
Worksheet 6-1B (Supplemental):  COUNTRY WASTE DISPOSAL DATA
Use Worksheet 6-1B if country or default data are not available on MSW
Generation Rate or Fraction of MSW Disposed to SWDSs .
1 Define the Population whose Waste goes to SWDSs for the inventory
year.  Enter the result in column A.  For developed countries this figure
is likely to be the total country population.  For developing countries
and countries with economies in transition, this may be the total urban
population only, because the rural population is assumed to dispose of
waste in such a way that CH4 emissions are extremely low.  Enter this
value (number of persons) into column A.
2 Enter the appropriate annual MSW Disposal Rate to SWDSs
(kg/capita/day) from Table 6-1 into column B.  If a default value for your
country is not available, choose the most appropriate default value
provided in the Table.  Choose a default value from a country that most
closely reflects your country’s waste disposal practices and prevailing
environmental conditions.  (This may be the country that is
geographically closest to your country.)

1 Estimate the Proportion of Waste (by weight) of Each Type of SWDSs
for the Total Annual MSW Disposed to SWDSs (i.e., the value in column
A of Worksheet 6-1).  These types of site are listed and defined in Table
6-2.
 
Enter these values into column W of Worksheet 6-1C to correspond
with the values x, y and z shown in Table 6-2.  [Check that x+y+z=1].
If you do not know values for x, y and z, then assume that all the waste
is disposed to unmanaged sites and do not enter any values for x, y or z.
Instead, enter the default value of 1 in the bottom of column W (as
shown in Table 6-2).
2 Enter the  Methane Correction Factors in column X for managed and
unmanaged sites to correspond with the values a, b and c shown in
Table 6-2.
3 Multiply the value in column W by the value in column X to give the
Weighted Average MCF for Each Type of Solid Waste Disposal Site.
Enter the result in column Y.
 
If country specific values are not available, use default values provided in
Table 6-2.  If you do not know values for a, b and c, enter the default
value of 0.6 (Table 6-2) in the bottom of column X.
4 Sum up the three values in column Y to give the total Weighted Average
MCF for Each Type of SWDS.  Enter the result in the bottom of
column Y.
 
If you have used the default value of 1 in column W, and the MCF
default value of 0.6, the Weighted Average MCF for Each Type of SWDS
is 1 x 0.6 = 0.6.  Enter 0.6 in the bottom of column Z.
Enter the total value in the bottom of column Y into column B of the main

1 Estimate the Fraction of Degradable Organic Carbon (DOC) in the
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) which is disposed of in SWDSs.  This can
be done:
• by using your own national data;
• by calculation using a knowledge of waste composition in your
country and the default DOC values of each fraction of waste given
in Table 6-3; or,
• by using the default values given in Table 6-1.
Use local data where these are available, and document your sources if you
do so.

2 Enter the Fraction of DOC which Actually Degrades into column D.
This is the fraction of the total DOC which actually degrades in a waste
disposal site.  The decomposition of DOC does not occur completely
and some of the potentially degradable material always remains in the
site even over a very long period of time.  Dissimilation is currently
under review, but the default value of 0.77 should be entered until
further information is available.
3 Enter the Fraction of Carbon Released as Methane in column E.  The
default value is 0.5.  If you have locally available data for this fraction
then it should be used.  Document your sources if you do so.
4 Calculate the Potential Methane Generation Rate per Unit of Waste by
multiplying together the values in columns C, D, and E with the
Conversion Ratio which converts carbon to CH4 in column F (16/12).
Enter the result into column G.

either through gas flaring or through energy recovery schemes.  Enter
the result in column K.
 
No default data are available.  Use locally available figures for the
amounts recovered if these are available.  Document your sources if you
do so.
 
Further details about factors to take into account and ways of calculating
methane oxidised by flaring or use are given in the Reference Manual.
3 Subtract the values in column K from the values in column J to give Net
Annual Methane Generation.  Enter the result in column L.
4 Enter the value One Minus the Methane Oxidation Correction Factor in
column M.  (The default value is 1-0=1).
5 Multiply the values in columns L and M to give the Net Annual Methane
Emissions.  Enter the result, in gigagrams of CH4, into column N.

Methane Emissions from Wastewater
Handling
6 . 3 . 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n
The handling of wastewater streams with high contents of organic material,
including domestic and commercial wastewater and some industrial
wastewater streams, can emit significant amounts of methane (Table 6-4).
Methane emissions from industrial wastewater are estimated to range from
26 to 40 Tg, while domestic and commercial sources emit approximately
2 Tg/yr.  Together, they account for 8 to 11 per cent of global methane
emissions (IPCC, 1995).
There are two basic types of wastewater handling, emissions from which
should be calculated separately.  These are:
• Domestic and commercial wastewater
• Industrial wastewater
The principal factor that determines methane generation potential of
wastewater is the amount of organic material in the wastewater stream.
For domestic and commercial wastewater and sludge, this is indicated by
the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD); for industrial wastewater, the
Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is used.  The BOD indicates the amount
of carbon that is aerobically biodegradable, whereas the COD indicates the
total amount of carbon, biodegradable and non-biodegradable, that is
available for oxidation.  This is a change from the previous methodology
(IPCC, 1995), which used BOD as the organic material parameter in both
domestic/commercial and industrial wastewater streams.
An important addition to the previous methodology (IPCC, 1995) is the
incorporation of emissions from sludge.  Sludge is produced as a by-product
of certain wastewater handling systems, and can produce methane under
anaerobic conditions.

Countries are encouraged to use their own data where available.
Otherwise, default values are given in the Tables.
Population: If wastewater produced in rural areas is managed without
formal handling and/or treatment systems, then countries may consider only
the urban population in estimating this emissions source.
Degradable Organic Component: If national or source-specific BOD
and COD output values are not available, the regional default values
(Table 6-5) should be used.  Consultation with national wastewater experts
is suggested.

The methodology considers emissions from wastewater and from sludge.
For each the method consists of three parts: total organic material;
emission factors; and emissions estimates.  The organic material in the
wastewater or sludge, measured as BOD or COD, is multiplied by an
average emission factor for each wastewater or sludge source to arrive at
an emissions estimate.
