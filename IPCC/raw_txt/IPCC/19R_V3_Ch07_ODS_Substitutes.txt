SUSBSTITUTES FOR OZONE DEPLETING 
SUBSTANCES 
Users are expected to go to Mapping Tables in Annex 5, before reading this chapter. This is required to 
correctly understand both the refinements made and how the elements in this chapter relate to the corresponding 
chapter in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines.  
 
7.1 
INTRODUCTION 
7.1.1 
Chemicals and relevant application areas covered 
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and, to a very limited extent, perfluorocarbons (PFCs), are serving as alternatives to 
ozone depleting substances (ODS) being phased out under the Montreal Protocol. Current and expected 
application areas of HFCs and PFCs include (IPCC/TEAP, 2005 and UNEP-TEAP 2016a/b): 
• 
refrigeration and air conditioning; 
• 
fire suppression and explosion protection; 
• 
aerosols; 
• 
solvent cleaning; 
• 
foam blowing; and 
• 
other applications1. 
These major groupings of current and expected usage are referred to in this chapter as applications within the 
ODS substitutes category. This introduction (Section 7.1) provides a general framework for estimating emissions 
from ODS substitutes, and subsequent sections (Sections 7.2 through 7.7) provide more specialised guidance on 
the individual applications introduced above. Some of these applications themselves encompass products or uses 
with diverse emission characteristics, and countries will produce more rigorous estimates if they account for this 
diversity through the adoption of disaggregated assessments (higher tier). Additionally, the use of HFCs and 
PFCs in some applications, specifically rigid foam (typically closed-cell foam), refrigeration and fire 
suppression, can lead to the development of long-lived banks2 of material. The emission patterns from these uses 
can be particularly complex and methods employing disaggregated data sets are essential to generate accurate 
emissions estimates. Other applications, such as aerosols and solvent cleaning may have short-term inventories 
of stock but, in the context of emission estimation, can still be considered as sources of prompt emission. This 
statement also applies to flexible foams (typically open-cell foam). 
HFCs are chemicals containing only hydrogen, carbon, and fluorine. Prior to the Montreal Protocol and the 
phase-out of various ODS, the only HFCs produced were HFC-152a, which is a component of the refrigerant 
blend R-500, and HFC-23, a low temperature refrigerant which is a by-product of HCFC-223 production. HFC-
134a entered production in 1991 and a variety of other HFCs have since been introduced and are now being used 
as ODS substitutes (IPCC/TEAP, 2005) among other applications. When collecting data on HFC and PFC 
consumption for reporting purposes, care needs to be taken to include those HFCs in blends, but, at the same 
time, to avoid including those components of a blend which are not required to be reported (e.g., CFCs and 
HCFCs). 
HFCs and PFCs have high global warming potentials (GWPs) and, in the case of PFCs, long atmospheric 
residence times. Table 7.1 gives an overview of the most important HFCs and PFCs, including their main 
 
1  HFCs and PFCs may also be used as ODS substitutes in sterilisation equipment, for tobacco expansion applications, and as 
solvents in the manufacture of adhesives, coating and inks. 
2 A bank is in this context the amount of ODS-substitutes stored in products (applications) in a country.

application areas. The various HFCs and PFCs have very different potencies as greenhouse gases. PFCs have 
particularly high GWPs regardless of the integrated time horizon adopted because of their long atmospheric 
lifetimes. The consumption patterns relating to individual gases must be known, therefore, or estimated with 
reasonable accuracy, to achieve useful assessments for the contribution to global warming from emissions of 
these groups of chemicals. 
As CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform, and, ultimately, HCFCs are being finally phased out4, 
HFCs are being selectively used as replacements. PFCs are also being used, but only to a limited extent. HFC 
use is expected to continue to grow, at least in the short term (UNEP-TEAP, 2016a/b). 
Since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were finalized, a major change has occurred in the policy framework regulating 
HFCs. Formerly, HFCs, which do not directly deplete O3, were not regulated under the Montreal Protocol. 
However, during the 28th meeting of the parties (MOP28) held in Kigali (Rwanda) in October 2016, 197 
countries adopted an amendment to phase down HFCs. The parties committed to cut the GWP-weighted 
production and consumption of HFCs by more than 80 percent over the next 30 years. Developed countries will 
begin reducing HFC consumption in 2019 and developing countries will follow with a freeze of HFC 
consumption levels between 2024 and 2028. A small group including the world’s hottest countries (India, 
Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait) will freeze HFC use by 2028. These production and consumption limits 
are expected to drive changes in the quantities and types of HFCs used in ODS substitute applications. To ensure 
that their HFC emissions inventories remain accurate, inventory compilers should familiarize themselves with 
the HFC limits in their countries and plan to gather data on the associated changes in HFC use and emissions.

MAIN APPLICATION AREAS FOR HFCS AND PFCS AS ODS SUBSTITUTES1 
Source: IPCC (1996), IPCC (2001), IPCC/TEAP (2005), UNEP-TEAP (2016a) 
1 Several applications use HFCs and PFCs as components of blends.  The other components of these blends are sometimes ODSs and/or non-
greenhouse gases. Several HFCs, PFCs and blends are sold under various trade names; only generic designations are used in this chapter.  
2 Other applications include sterilisation equipment, tobacco expansion applications, plasma etching of electronic chips (PFC-116) and as 
solvents in the manufacture of adhesive coatings and inks (Kroeze, 1995; U.S. EPA, 1992a).  Note that although the use of PFCs for plasma 
etching is mentioned as an example in footnotes 2 and 3 to this table, the methodology for estimating emissions is described in Chapter 6 of 
Volume 3: Electronics Industry Emissions.   
3 PFC-14 (chemically CF4) is used as a minor component of a proprietary blend. Its main use is for semiconductor etching. 
4 PFC-51-14 is an inert material, which has little or nil ability to dissolve soils. It can be used as a carrier for other solvents or to dissolve and 
deposit disk drive lubricants. PFCs are also used to test that sealed components are hermetically sealed.  
 
7.1.2 
General methodological issues for all ODS substitute 
applications 
7.1.2.1 OVERVIEW OF ODS SUBSTITUTE ISSUES 
No refinement. 
7.1.2.2 CHOICE OF METHOD 
As already described, emissions of ODS substitutes can be estimated in a variety of ways with varying degrees 
of complexity and data intensity. This chapter provides less data-intensive Tier 1 methods, typically based on 
low levels of disaggregation, and more data-intensive Tier 2 methods, which require higher levels of 
disaggregation. A third Tier (Tier 3), based on actual monitoring and measurement of emissions from point 
sources, is technically possible for specific sub-applications but this is rarely, if ever, employed for ODS 
substitutes, because the individual point sources are widely disparate. Accordingly, Tier 3 methods are not 
addressed further in this chapter. 
TIER 1 METHODS 
Tier 1 methods tend to be less data-intensive and less complex than Tier 2 because emission estimates are 
usually carried out at the application level rather than for individual products or equipment types. However, the 
approaches proposed vary considerably depending on the characteristics of the specific application. There can be 
Tier 1a approaches, Tier 1b approaches and, sometimes, combinations of the two (Tier 1 a/b). The latter is often 
the case where data are in short supply. Effectively, the output of a Tier 1a approach can be cross-checked using 
a Tier 1b method. In general, however, the simple methods tend to be based primarily on a Tier 1a approach 
(emission-factor approach) with the default emission factor being up to 100 percent for prompt release 
applications. 
For simpler Tier 1 approaches, the chemical sales data at the application level is usually sufficient. However, 
separating out individual components of blends can still represent a considerable challenge. Irrespective of the 
Tier 1 methodology chosen, countries will need to report emissions of individual HFCs and PFCs. Information 
on the practical use of the various commercial types of HFC/PFC refrigerants, blowing agents, solvents, etc. will 
therefore be required. Many of these products are mixtures of two or more HFCs and/or PFCs, and the 
composition of fluids for similar purposes may vary according to individual formulas developed by different 
chemical companies. 
Tier 1a – Emission-factor approach at the application level 
Tier 1a relies on the availability of basic activity data at the application level, rather than at the level of 
equipment or product type (sub-application). This activity data may consist of annual chemical consumption data 
and, for applications exhibiting delayed emissions, banks derived therefrom. Once activity data have been 
established at the application level, composite emission factors (see Section 7.1.2.3) are then also applied at the 
application level. These more aggregated emission factors (e.g., all rigid foams) can be a composite or weighted 
average of the emission factors developed for Tier 2a covering individual equipment or product types, or can be 
a validated approximation approach (e.g., Gamlen et al. 1986).   
The calculation formula for Net Consumption within the Tier 1a method is as follows:

Net Consumption values for each HFC or PFC are then used to calculate annual emissions for applications 
exhibiting prompt emissions as follows:

Composite EF

•
=
 
Where: 
Net Consumption  
= net consumption for the application 
Composite EF  
= composite emission factor for the application 
Note that, as discussed in the Choice of Activity Data section, inventory compilers may have access to chemical 
consumption data at the aggregate level rather than by application. In this case, it will be necessary as an early 
step to determine the share of total consumption represented by each application. 
In equation 7.1, Production refers to production of new chemical. Reprocessing of recovered fluid should not be 
included in consumption estimates. Imports and Exports include bulk chemicals but, for a Tier 1 method is 
unlikely to contain the quantity of chemical contained in products, such as refrigerators, air-conditioners, 
packaging materials, insulating foams, fire extinguishers etc. unless regional allocation system or other method 
of approximation has been used. The term composite emission factor refers to an emissions rate that summarises 
the emissions rates of different types of equipment, product or, more generally, sub-applications within an ODS 
application area. Composite emission factors should account for assembly, operation and, where relevant in the 
time-series, disposal emissions. 
Although destruction of virgin HFCs and PFCs is not currently practised widely, and may be technically difficult 
in some cases (UNEP TEAP Task Force on Destruction Technologies (UNEP-TEAP, 2002)), it should be 
included as a potential option to reduce consumption. It should be noted that destruction of virgin chemicals, as 
considered here, is distinct from the destruction of HFCs and PFCs in the end-of-life phase, which is strictly an 
emission reduction measure. By-product emissions during HFC/PFC production and fugitive emissions related 
to production and distribution have to be calculated separately. 
Even in simple Tier 1a methods, it is usually necessary to account for the potential development of banks, where 
these can occur. Banks are the amounts of chemical that have accumulated throughout the lifecycle, either in  
supply chains, products, equipment or even waste streams but which, as of the end of the most recent year, has 
not been emitted. At the application level, banks can be estimated using relatively straight-forward algorithms 
and assumptions provided that the historic Net Consumption is known for each year following the introduction 
of the substance or, where this period exceeds the average lifetime of the product or equipment, over that 
average lifetime. Relevant application level emission factors are then applied to the banks to deal with emissions 
during the lifetime of the products or equipment. This same process is carried out for Tier 2a methods but, in that 
case, at the sub-application level. More general information on banks is contained in Section 7.1.2.1. 
In cases where banks occur, Equation 7.2a is then modified to the following:

Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use  
 
 
7.10 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
Composite emission factors are determined by taking an average of the applicable sub-application emission 
factors, weighted according to the activity in each sub-application. Sub-application emission factors can be 
country-specific where known or default. In practice, if sub-application data are known, inventory compilers 
would opt for a Tier 2 (disaggregated approach). If only application level data are known, representative 
composite emission factors from other studies or default composite emission factors provided in this chapter can 
be used. 
Tier 1b – Mass-balance approach at the application level 
The mass balance approach also estimates emissions from assembly, operation, and disposal, but does not rely 
on emission factors. Instead, the method uses measured consumption (i.e., sales) of each chemical in the country 
or facility being considered. It is generally limited to ODS Substitutes contained in pressurised systems. The 
general equation is as follows5:

Industry needs to purchase new chemical from manufacturers in order to replace leakage (i.e., emissions) from 
the current equipment stock, or the equipment will not function properly. If the equipment stock did not change 
from year to year, then annual chemical consumption alone would provide a reasonable estimate of actual 
leakage or emissions. The total equipment stock, and the chemical charge it contains, however, does change 
from year to year. Some amount of new equipment containing a chemical charge is introduced each year, and 
some amount of old equipment that was charged originally is retired each year. If the total chemical charge 
contained in all equipment is increasing as a result of this annual turnover, then total annual chemical 
consumption will overestimate emissions (i.e., the charge contained in new equipment is greater than the original 
charge of the retired equipment). Conversely, if the total chemical charge in all equipment is decreasing, then 
total annual chemical consumption will underestimate emissions. 
In order to make good use of data on annual sales of new chemical, it is therefore also necessary to estimate the 
total charge contained in new equipment, and the original charge contained in retiring equipment. The total 
charge of new equipment minus the original total charge of retiring equipment represents the net change in the 
charge of the equipment stock. (Using the mass balance approach, it is not necessary to know the total amount of 
each chemical in equipment stock in order to calculate emissions.) Where the net change is positive, some of the 
new chemical is being used to satisfy the increase in the total charge, and therefore cannot be said to replace 
emissions from the previous year.  
Industry also requires new chemical to replace destroyed gas and for stockpiles. Additionally, not all equipment 
will be serviced annually. Terms can be added to the general equation to account for these factors but are not 
typically adopted within simple Tier 1b methods.   
This approach is most directly applicable to the pressure equipment used in refrigeration and air conditioning, 
and fire protection applications because these are where chemical sales are most typically used to offset 
operational emissions. However, since the basic method is relatively simple to apply, it is more typical to extend 
the approach to the sub-application level (i.e., a Tier 2b method). Further elaboration and modification of this 
approach is provided in the description of each application. In practice, Tier 1b methods are most commonly 
used as a further cross-check to Tier 1a methods. Where basic Net Consumption data is lacking, regional and 
international databases and models have been developed that allocate regional chemical sales for different end 
uses (sub-applications) at a country level. These can therefore be used to source relevant data. 
Tier 2 methods – applied at the sub-application level 
There are two versions of the Tier 2 method, both of which result in emission calculations for each individual 
chemical and distinct types of products or equipment at the sub-application level or within a sub-application. The 
individual chemicals and products/equipment within the sub-application form the matrix referred to earlier in 
this section and their analysis is comparable with methods currently applied by the Alternative Fluorocarbons 
Environmental Acceptability Study (AFEAS) for CFCs, HCFCs and HFCs (McCulloch, Midgley and Ashford, 
2001 and 2003; Ashford, Clodic, Kuijpers and McCulloch, 2004).   
 
5  Boundary conditions: If there is no net change in the total equipment charge, then annual sales are equal to emissions. If 
the net change in the total equipment charge is equal to annual sales, then emissions are zero. 
 Chapter 7: Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for Ozone Depleting Substances 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
7.11 
Both versions of the Tier 2 methodology follow two general steps: 
a) 
Calculation or estimation of the time series of net consumption of each individual HFC and PFC 
chemical at a relatively detailed product and equipment level to establish the consumption basis for 
emission calculations. (e.g., refrigerators, other stationary refrigeration/AC equipment, appliance 
foams, insulated panels, pipe insulation, etc.) 
b) 
Estimation of emissions using the activity data and resulting bank calculations derived from step (i), 
and either emission factors that reflect the unique emission characteristics related to various 
processes, products and equipment (Tier 2a) or, relevant new and retiring equipment information at 
the sub-application level to support a mass balance approach. (Tier 2b). 
The difference between Tier 2a and Tier 2b is the same as that for Tier 1a and Tier 1b – namely Tier 2a methods 
use an emission-factor approach while Tier 2b methods follow a mass-balance approach. Both, however, need to 
be operated at a level of disaggregation appropriate to a Tier 2 method, typically at least at the sub-application 
level. 
If the requisite data are available, a Tier 2 method is preferred for estimating emissions from ODS substitutes, 
particularly where the sub-applications within an overall application area are relatively heterogeneous. Some 
countries may already have the relevant information available to apply a Tier 2 methodology. Other countries 
might not have access to data for Tier 2 at present, but they are encouraged to establish routines to collect either 
country-specific or globally or regionally-derived activity data by chemical and sub-application within an 
application area (e.g., different types of refrigeration and air conditioning sub-applications). Tier 1, in contrast, 
requires data collection at a more aggregated application level (e.g., refrigeration and air conditioning in its 
totality).  
As a first step in using the Tier 2 method, countries may wish to make first order approximation of the 
information needed for step (i). This will give direction to more focused data collection efforts in certain 
application areas or sub-categories. Table 7.3 gives the consumption distribution for all application areas in 2015 
for the Article 5 (mainly developing countries) and Non-Article 5 Parties (developed countries) to the Montreal 
Protocol. The distribution is based on estimated consumption of ODS-substitutes in metric tonnes (UNEP-TEAP 
2016b).  
Table 7.3a and 7.3b gives the consumption of ODS-substitutes for the application category Refrigeration and Air 
Conditioning in 2015 for Article 5 and Non-Article 5 Parties, by substance and sub-application.  
Table 7.3c shows the share of total consumption used for manufacturing (filling of new equipment) and servicing 
(refilling of operating equipment). 
Good practice guidance in this section deals with variations of the Tier 2 method. Tier 1 methods, covered 
previously, are generally seen as default methods where the application is not a key category and data 
availability is limited. (Exceptionally, for Fire Protection, Tier 1a method with country-specific activity data and 
emission factor will be used in the case it is identified as key category.) Each sub-section of Sections 7.2 to 7.7 
discusses how to apply these methods to specific ODS applications, reviews existing data sources, and identifies 
gaps therein.

Tier 2a – Emission-factor approach 
The country-specific data required for a Tier 2a approach are derived from the number of products and end-uses 
relevant to each sub-application in which ODS substitutes are contained and from which ODS substitutes are 
ultimately emitted. This approach seeks information on the number of equipment units or products that use these 
chemicals, average chemical charges, average service life, emission rates, recycling, disposal, and other pertinent 
parameters. This information is generally collected at the level of distinct groups of products or equipment (e.g., 
for rigid foams: integral skin, continuous panel, discontinuous panel, appliance, injected foam products and 
others). Annual emissions are then estimated as a function of these parameters through the life of the units or 
products by the application of emission factors that are relevant to the lifecycle phases. Since equipment and 
other products vary significantly in the amount of chemical used, service life, and emission rates, the 
characterisation of this equipment can be a resource intensive task. The longer-lived the end-use equipment or

product, and the more diverse the types of equipment or product within a particular sub-application, the more 
complex the sourced data approach has to be in order to account for emissions. However, the approach can 
provide an accurate estimate of emissions if the data called for by the following equation are available for all 
relevant types and vintages of equipment or product:

Manufacturing or Assembly Emissions occur as fugitives when new equipment is filled for the first time with a 
chemical or when a product is manufactured. Operational Emissions from equipment and products occur as 
leaks or by diffusion during the use phase of the product or equipment (including servicing). In some cases, there 
can even be intentional releases during operation. Finally, Disposal Emissions can occur when the equipment or 
product reaches its end-of-life and is decommissioned and disposed of. In this case, the remaining HFC/PFC in 
the product or equipment may escape to the atmosphere, be recycled, or possibly destroyed. 
As with the Tier 1a method, there is a need to make provision for the development of banks in some applications. 
This can lead to complex multiple calculations at the sub-application level, since the dynamics of banks may 
vary considerably. However, because the individual algorithms rely on a simple sequential calculation of non-
emitted consumption (i.e., consumption – emissions for each successive year), excellent emission assessments 
can result from a well-constructed and well-maintained national model.  
The need to update equipment and product inventories on an annual basis can be a major implementation 
challenge for inventory compilers with limited resources. This challenge is made somewhat easier because it 
may not be necessary to collect annual chemical consumption if a comprehensive set of other market parameters 
is available (e.g., number of domestic refrigerators produced, etc.) In some countries or regions, trade 
associations can be a significant source of such data. Otherwise, specific market research may be necessary. 
Where such market parameters are the primary source of activity data, the potential magnitude of errors that can 
be introduced by small discrepancies at unit level makes it good practice to carry out a chemical consumption 
data cross-check to act as a means of providing quality assurance. The relevant QA/QC sections of this chapter 
give guidance on how to conduct such cross-checks for each relevant application. 
In order to limit the burden of data management for both annual consumption data and the status of banks, it is 
possible to access international and regional databases of such information to gain the necessary inputs of 
globally or regionally validated data to maintain a national model. These databases can also help to overcome 
any confidentiality barriers that may exist in collecting and/or publishing data at a national level, particularly 
where the number of suppliers is low. More information on the use of such databases is contained in Section 
7.1.2.4 and Box 7.1. 
Even where comprehensive country-specific activity data exists at a country level, it is good practice to 
benchmark outputs against assessments made from databases of globally or regionally derived data. This need 
not be done on an annual basis but could reasonably be conducted every 2-3 years. Significant discrepancies can 
then be analysed and suitable actions taken to reconcile differences. 
Tier 2b – Mass-balance approach 
Tier 2 mass-balance approaches are similar to those described for Tier 1b, except that the process is applied at 
the sub-application level. This is a particularly valuable approach for the refrigeration sector where there are a 
significant number of relatively heterogeneous sub-applications. As is also the case for Tier 1 methods, it is not 
uncommon to see mass-balance approaches used in combination with emission-factor approaches to ensure that 
the outputs achieved are as robust as possible. Such approaches can realistically be described as hybrid Tier 2a/b 
methods and they will be identified as such, where they occur in the relevant application-specific sections that 
follow.  
Since mass-balance approaches also require activity data at the sub-application level, it may be more resource- 
efficient to use global or regional databases to obtain appropriate globally or regionally validated data.  The same 
criteria for selection as set out for Tier 2a methods also apply for Tier 2b methods. Accordingly, equal care 
should be taken in selecting validated datasets.

REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING 
7.5.1 
Chemicals covered in this application area  
 
Refrigeration and air-conditioning (RAC) systems may be classified in up to six sub-application domains or 
categories (UNEP-RTOC, 2003), although fewer sub-applications may be used in some countries. These 
categories correspond to sub-applications that may differ by location and purpose, and are listed below: 
a) 
Domestic (i.e., household) refrigeration, 
b) 
Commercial refrigeration including different types of equipment, from vending machines to 
centralised refrigeration systems in supermarkets, 
c) 
Industrial processes including chillers, cold storage, and industrial heat pumps used in the food, 
petrochemical and other industries, 
d) 
Transport refrigeration including equipment and systems used in refrigerated trucks, containers, 
reefers, and wagons, 
e) 
Stationary air conditioning including air-to-air systems, heat pumps, and chillers6 for building and 
residential applications, 
f) 
Mobile air-conditioning systems used in passenger cars, truck cabins, buses, and trains.7 
For all these sub-applications, different HFCs are progressively replacing CFCs and HCFCs. For example, in 
developed and several developing countries, HFC-134a has replaced CFC-12 in domestic refrigeration, high-
pressure chillers and mobile air conditioning systems, and blends of HFCs such as R-407C (HFC-32/HFC-
125/HFC-134a) and R-410A (HFC-32/HFC-125) are replacing HCFC-22 mainly in stationary air conditioning. 
HFC blends R-404A (HFC-125/HFC-143a/HFC-134a) and R-507A (HFC-125/HFC-143a) have replaced R-502 
(CFC-22/CFC-115) and HCFC-22 in commercial refrigeration. Other, non-HFC substances are also used to 
replace CFCs and HCFCs such as iso-butane (HC-600a) in domestic refrigeration or ammonia in industrial 
refrigeration. 
A large number of blends containing HFCs and/or PFCs are being used in Refrigeration and Air Conditioning 
applications. Table 7.8 shows some of these blends. A more comprehensive list can be obtained at the UNEP 
Ozone Secretariat web site (https://ozone.unep.org/sites/default/files/Data-Reporting-Instructions-English.2019-
03-20.pdf) or by contacting The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers 
(ASHRAE). 
 
 
 
 
6 Comfort air conditioning in large commercial buildings (including hotels, offices, hospitals, universities, etc.) is commonly 
provided by water chillers coupled with an air handling and distribution system.  
7 The sub-application of mobile air conditioning systems is likely to represent the largest share of HFC emissions within the 
Refrigeration and Air Conditioning application for many countries.  See Section 7.5.2.4, Applying Tier 2 Methods – The 
Example Of Mobile Air Conditioning (MAC), for an example of how to calculate these emissions. The reader will see that 
limited information is needed to approximate these emissions, and essentially becomes a simple multiplication of an 
average emission factor and the number of cars with HFC air conditioning, and possibly adding emissions relating to 
container management, charging and end-of-life.

7.5.2 
Methodological issues 
7.5.2.1 CHOICE OF METHOD 
As discussed in the introductory section to this chapter, both Tier 1 and Tier 2 result in estimates of actual 
emissions rather than estimates of potential emissions. Actual estimates, which account for the lag between 
consumption and emissions, are particularly important for both the refrigeration and air conditioning sector 
because of the potentially long retention of refrigerants in products and equipment utilised in these applications.  
The options available to the refrigeration and air conditioning application are shown in the decision tree shown 
in Figure 7.6.  
 
TIER 1 
Tier 1 a/b 
It is expected that the refrigeration and air conditioning will be a key category for many countries. The 
implication of this conclusion from Table 7.2 and the decision tree in Figure 7.6 is that either country-specific or 
globally or regionally derived activity data will be required at the sub-application (disaggregated) level in order 
to complete the reporting task. However, in the rare instances that the refrigeration and air conditioning 
application is much less significant, there should be available a suitable Tier 1 method for aggregated data. 
From experience of studying the dynamics of refrigerant consumption and banks in several countries (UNEP-
RTOC, 2003; Ashford, Clodic, Kuijpers and McCulloch, 2004; and supporting materials), it is possible to derive 
assumptions that allow for the assessment of the use of refrigerant that may help in assessing sales of a given 
refrigerant at a country level. Such a hybrid Tier 1a/b approach may use the following assumptions:  
1. Servicing of equipment containing the refrigerant does not commence until 3 years after the equipment is 
installed. 
2. Emissions from banked refrigerants average 15 percent annually across the whole RAC application area. 
This assumption is estimated to be a weighed average across all sub-applications, for which default emission 
factors are shown in Table 7.9. 
3. In a mature market two thirds of the sales of a refrigerant are used for servicing and one third is used to 
charge new equipment. A mature market is one in which ODS substitute-employing refrigeration equipment 
is in wide use, and there are relationships between suppliers and users to purchase and service equipment.  
4. The average equipment lifetime is 15 years. This assumption is also estimated to be a weighed average 
across all sub-applications. 
5. The complete transition to a new refrigerant technology will take place over a 10 year period. From 
experiences to date, this assumption is believed to be valid for a single chemical in a single country. 
With these assumptions in place, it is possible to derive emissions, if the following data can be provided:  
• 
Sales of a specific refrigerant in the year to be reported 
• 
Year of introduction of the refrigerant 
• 
Growth rate in sales of new equipment (usually assumed linear across the period of assessment) 
• 
Assumed percentage of new equipment exported 
• 
Assumed percentage of new equipment imported 
The Tier 1a/b method then back-calculates the development of banks of a refrigerant from the current reporting 
year to the year of its introduction. In mapping this period, the method also models the transition from sales to 
new equipment (100 percent initially) to the mature market position assumed based on experience to be 33 
percent to new equipment and 67 percent to servicing requirements. It is assumed that the transition to new 
refrigerant technology is reflected identically in any imported equipment.

The following spreadsheet example indicates how the Tier 1a/b method would estimate a seven-year time series 
of emissions of the selected refrigerant, following its initial introduction in 1998, with the knowledge that there 
were sales of 1 000 tonnes in 2005. The spreadsheet contained in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines CDROM mirrors 
this calculation, and globally or regionally derived datasets8 at both application and consolidated sub-application 
levels should be available at a country level to assist in completion of this spreadsheet. 
 
8 As noted in Box 7.1, inclusion in the IPCC Emission Factor Database (EFDB) will indicate general adherence to due 
process, but it is good practice for countries to ensure that all data taken from the EFDB are appropriate for their national 
circumstances.

In this hypothetical example, the production of a specific refrigerant are 800 tonnes with an additional 200 
tonnes in imported equipment, in 2005 making a total consumption of 1 000 tonnes. Based on this consumption 
figure and knowledge of the year of introduction of the refrigerant, it can be seen that the Tier 1a/b method 
predicts emissions of 461 tonnes based on the development of banks over the previous seven years. The bank in 
2005 is estimated at 3 071 tonnes.  
It should be noted that, while such methods allow for the estimation of emissions when data are difficult to 
obtain, it is still necessary to have an accurate assessment of country-specific or globally or regionally derived 
net consumption activity data. When the content of Table 7.8 is considered (particularly when some of these 
blends may be being imported in equipment) it is clear that there needs to be considerable knowledge of 
technology selection in the market. Refrigerant suppliers should be able to assist inventory compilers in this area, 
but the burden of developing high quality activity datasets may lead inventory compilers to the conclusion that 
Tier 2 options provide more value with little extra work. Indeed, where globally or regionally validated data 
activity is sought, this will normally be a reconstitution of disaggregated data originally at the sub-application 
level, so it might be most logical to take full advantage of that versatility and pursue a Tier 2 approach from the 
outset. 
 
TIER 2 
Overview 
The Tier 2a methodology: 
a) 
Takes into account the phase out or the phase down of CFCs and HCFCs depending on the Montreal 
Protocol schedule and possible national or regional regulations, in order to establish the refrigerant 
choice for all applications; 
b) 
Defines the typical refrigerant charge and the equipment lifetime per sub-application; 
c) 
Defines the emission factors for refrigerant charge, during operation, at servicing and at end-of-life. 
Calculation of emissions throughout the equipment lifetime requires deriving the total stock of equipment 
independent of their vintage. In doing so the refrigerant bank is established per sub-application.

2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
In order to achieve consistency it is suggested to derive the annual market of refrigerants from the refrigerant 
quantities charged in the brand new equipment and from the refrigerant quantities used for servicing of the total 
stock of equipment. 
The Tier 2b mass-balance approach relies on a knowledge of the annual sales of refrigerant, refrigerant destroyed 
and any changes in equipment stock that occur (i.e., new equipment sales and equipment decommissioned) on a 
sub-application basis. It does not require an absolute knowledge of equipment stocks or emission factors relating 
to each refrigeration and air conditioning sub-application.   
Examples of how the Tier 2 methodology may be applied are given in the remainder of this section. 
Tier 2b - Mass-balance approach 
The mass-balance approach is particularly applicable to the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning application 
because of the significant servicing component required to maintain equipment. The general approach to Tier 2b 
is introduced in Chapter 1 of Volume 3. 
For the mass-balance approach, the four emission stages (charging, operation servicing and end-of-life) 
identified above are addressed in the following simplified equation:  
EQUATION 7.9 
DETERMINATION OF REFRIGERANT EMISSIONS BY MASS BALANCE 
Amount of Intentional Destruction
Total Charge of Retiring Equipment
Original
Total Charge of New Equipment
Annual Sales of New Refrigerant
Emissions
−
+
−
=
 
 
Annual Sales of New Refrigerant is the amount of a chemical introduced into the refrigeration sector in a 
particular country in a given year. It includes all chemical used to fill or refill equipment, whether the chemical is 
charged into equipment at the factory, charged into equipment after installation, or used to recharge equipment at 
servicing. It does not include recycled or reclaimed chemical. 
Total Charge of New Equipment is the sum of the full charges of all the new equipment that is sold in the 
country in a given year. It includes both the chemical required to fill equipment in the factory and the chemical 
required to fill the equipment after installation. It does not include charging emissions or chemical used to 
recharge equipment at servicing. 
Original Total Charge of Retiring Equipment is the sum of the full charges of all the retiring equipment 
decommissioned in a country in a given year. It assumes that the equipment will have been serviced right up to 
its decommissioning and will therefore contain its original charge.  
Amount of Intentional Destruction is that quantity of the chemical duly destroyed by a recognised destruction 
technology. 
In each country there is a stock of existing refrigeration equipment that contains an existing stock of refrigerant 
chemical (bank). Therefore, annual sales of new chemical refrigerant must be used for one of three purposes: 
• 
To increase the size of the existing chemical stock (bank) in use (including retrofitting equipment from a 
previous chemical to the given chemical); 
• 
To replace that fraction of last year’s stock of chemical that was emitted to the atmosphere (through, for 
example, leaks or servicing losses); 
• 
To provide supply-chain priming or stockpiles. 
Since the third item in this list is rarely required in a steady-state market, it is not included in Equation 7.9. 
Terms to account for stockpiling and retrofitting could be added to Equation 7.9 if such situations exist.  
The difference between the total quantity of gas sold and the quantity of that gas used to increase the size of the 
chemical stock equals the amount of chemical emitted to the atmosphere. The increase in the size of the chemical 
stock is equal to the difference between the total charges of the new and retiring equipment. 
By using data on current and historical sales of gas, rather than emission factors referenced from literature, the 
equation reflects assembly, operation, and disposal emissions at the time and place where they occur. Default 
emission factors may not be accurate because emissions rates may vary considerably from country to country 
and even within a single country.  
As discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.5 of Volume 3, one drawback of the mass-balance approach is that it can 
underestimate emissions when equipment stocks are growing, because there is a lag between the time the 
emissions occur and the time they are detected (through equipment servicing). This underestimate will be 
 Chapter 7: Emissions of Fluorinated Substitutes for Ozone Depleting Substances 
 
 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
7.23 
relatively large in countries where HFCs have been used in equipment for less than ten years, because much of 
the equipment will have leaked without ever being serviced. Thus, countries where HFCs have been used for less 
than ten years are encouraged to estimate emissions using alternative approaches. In general, the longer HFCs 
are used in a country, the smaller the underestimate associated with the mass-balance approach. Once equipment 
containing HFCs begins to retire, the underestimate declines to a low level. 
Equation 7.9 can be applied either to individual types of equipment (sub-applications), or more generally to all 
air conditioning and refrigeration equipment in a country (i.e., Tier 1b), depending on the level of disaggregation 
of available data. If disaggregated data are available, emissions estimates developed for each type of equipment 
and chemical are summed to determine total emissions for the application.  
Tier 2a – Emission-factor approach 
In a Tier 2a calculation, refrigerant emissions at a year t from each of the six9 sub-applications of refrigeration 
and air conditioning systems are calculated separately. These emissions result from:  
• 
Econtainers,t = emissions related to the management of refrigerant containers 
• 
Echarge,t = emissions related to the refrigerant charge: connection and disconnection of the refrigerant 
container and the new equipment to be charged 
• 
Elifetime,t = annual emissions from the banks of refrigerants associated with the six sub-applications during 
operation (fugitive emissions and ruptures) and servicing 
• 
Eend-of-life,t = emissions at system disposal 
All these quantities are expressed in kilograms and have to be calculated for each type of HFC used in the six 
different sub-applications.

Methods for estimating average emission rates for the above-mentioned sectors are outlined below and need to 
be calculated on a refrigerant by refrigerant basis for all equipment regardless of their vintage. If information on 
container and charging emissions is not available, inventory compilers can estimate these losses as a percent of 
the bank and revise the lifetime (operation plus servicing) emission factor in Equation 7.13 below to account for 
such losses. 
Refrigerant management of containers 
The emissions related to the refrigerant container management comprises all the emissions related to the 
refrigerant transfers from bulk containers (typically 40 tonnes) down to small capacities where the mass varies 
from 0.5 kg (disposable cans) to 1 tonne (containers) and also from the remaining quantities - the so-called 
refrigerant heels (vapour and /or liquid) - left in the various containers, which are recovered or emitted.

application), percent 
Note: the emissions related to the process of connecting and disconnecting during servicing are covered in 
Equation 7.13. 
The amount charged (Mt) should include all systems which are charged in the country, including those which are 
produced for export. Systems that are imported pre-charged should not be considered. 
Typical range for the emission factor k varies from 0.1 to 3 percent. The emissions during the charging process 
are very different for factory assembled systems where the emissions are low (see Table 7.9) than for field-
erected systems where emissions can be up to 2 percent. 
Emissions during lifetime (operation and servicing) 
Annual leakage from the refrigerant banks represent fugitive emissions, i.e., leaks from fittings, joints, shaft seals, 
etc. but also ruptures of pipes or heat exchangers leading to partial or full release of refrigerant to the atmosphere. 
Besides component failures, such as compressor burn-out, equipment is serviced mainly when the refrigerating 
capacity is too low due to loss of refrigerant from fugitive emissions. Depending on the application, servicing 
will be done for instance every year or every three years, or sometimes not at all during the entire lifetime such 
as in domestic refrigeration sub-applications. For some sub-applications, leaks have to be fixed during servicing 
and refrigerant recovery may be necessary, so the recovery efficiency has to be taken into account when 
estimating emission factors. In addition, knowing the annual refrigerant needs for servicing per sub-application 
allows the determination of the national refrigerant market by adding the refrigerant quantities charged in new 
equipment (see Paragraph Quality assurance/Quality control). The following calculation formula applies:

In calculating the refrigerant bank (Bt) all systems in operation in the country (produced domestically and 
imported) have to be considered on a sub-application by sub-application basis. 
Examples of typical leakage rates (x) for various types of equipment describing the respective refrigeration sub-
applications are given in Table 7.9. 
Emissions at end-of-life 
The amount of refrigerant released from scrapped systems depends on the amount of refrigerant left at the time 
of disposal, and the portion recovered. From a technical point of view, the major part of the remaining fluid can 
be recovered, but recovery at end-of-life depends on regulations, financial incentives, and environmental 
consciousness. 
The following calculation formula (Equation 7.14) is applicable to estimate emissions at system disposal:

A basic calculation tool in the form of MS Excel worksheet “Calculation Example for 2F1” can be 
downloaded at the IPCC web site (https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html).  
2. Activity Data 
Collect the data required as inputs to the calculations: 
• 
Consumption of specific HFCs or other ODS substitutes, at least in the year to be reported 
• 
Year of introduction of the refrigerant 
• 
Growth rate in sales of new equipment 
Look for data in, for example, Refrigerant Management Plans (RMPs), HCFC Phase-out 
Management Plans (HPMPs) or data reported under the Montreal Protocol. To get an idea of the 
most important gas types and application areas, see Tables 7.3a-d. 
3. Emission Factors 
Identify and apply the appropriate emission factors. The IPCC Worksheet contains the default Tier 
1 emission factor. Modify the default emission factor according to country-specific conditions if 
information on these conditions is available. 
 
TIER 2a 
Where refrigeration and air conditioning is a key category, a Tier 2 approach should be used to 
estimate emissions. Building a good quality Tier 2 inventory for refrigerants is demanding, so 
setting up a plan for gradual improvement over time is recommended. 
1. Calculation tools 
The spreadsheet "Calculation example for 2F1 (Tier 2)" of the 2019 Refinement can be used. Most 
countries have however built their own models, which are adapted to national conditions and to the 
data they have available.   
2. Activity data 
For the Tier 2 approach HFC consumption needs to be collected or estimated for each of the six 
sub-applications listed in Section 7.5.1.  
Box 7.2b and Box 7.2c gives information on what data needs to be collected. 
Data sources are described in Box 7.3a. 
3. Emission factors 
Table 7.9 provides ranges of default factors for the sub-applications if country-specific factors are 
not available. Choose from the ranges according to country-specific conditions and document the 
reasons for the choices. In general, the emission factors in the low end of the ranges apply for 
developed countries or those that have a voluntary or mandatory system in place to limit emissions 
during equipment service, use and disposal. Further discussion on the choice of emission factors is 
found in section 7.5.2.2.

THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF  AN EMISSION INVENTORY FOR R/AC 
Emissions of HFCs from refrigeration and air conditioning (R/AC) equipment are closely related 
to the amounts and types of chemicals in the bank of a country. A "bank” is the amount of HFCs 
and other fluorinated ODS-substitutes contained in equipment in use. It is therefore important for 
the inventory compiler to keep track of the bank and the flows of chemicals into and out of the 
bank. The following equation summarizes how the bank changes over the year due to emissions 
and other flows. More details are given in the spreadsheet "Calculation example for 2F1 (Tier 2)".   
Estimation of annual refrigerant bank  
Banky = Banky-1 + Additiony - Removaly 
Where: 
             Banky = Refrigerant bank on December 31st of year y, kg 
             Banky-1 = Refrigerant bank on December 31st of year y-1/January 1st of year y, kg 
             Additiony  = Addition of new substances year y, kg 
             Removaly = Removal of substances exported, emitted or destroyed year y, kg 
The figure below illustrates these relationships.

THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF  AN EMISSION INVENTORY FOR R/AC 
The Bank of HFCs 
The starting point for the annual estimates is a snapshot of the bank of HFCs at the end of the 
previous year/beginning of the current year.  
The bank is the amount of HFCs contained in equipment in use in a country, and a snapshot of the 
bank means that for each of the relevant sub-applications, you need to have an estimate of the 
types and amounts of HFCs it contains. For instance, you need to quantify the amount of HFC-
134a in air conditioning units in cars, the amount of the blend R-410A in air conditioning used in 
buildings, R-404A used for refrigeration in supermarkets etc. See the list of chemicals and the 
equipment (sub-applications) in which they are normally contained in Table 7.1.  Note that in a 
given year, equipment may contain substances other than HFCs. If this is the case, you need to 
estimate the share of HFCs in relation to the other substances (e.g. HCFC, NH3, etc.).   
If you start the calculations at the beginning of the first year of HFCs entering the market in your 
country, there is no bank of chemicals and the bank at January 1st of year y = 0.  
If you start making the inventory when HFCs are already in use in your country, you will have to 
spend time putting together information on what the bank currently looks like. See Box 7.2c on 
how to estimate the bank if the starting point of the inventory is not the first year of using HFC, i.e. 
when the bank at January 1st of year y > 0.  
In the future, this kind of snapshot of the equipment population (bank) will be one of the outputs 
from the calculation model you run every year. 
 
The flows of HFCs into and out of the bank 
The bank will develop year by year depending on the amounts of HFC added to and removed from 
the bank. In order to keep track of the development of the bank, you need to collect data on or 
estimate these flows:  
 
Flow of HFCs into the bank 
HFC is mainly added to the bank through two processes:  New equipment containing HFCs and 
the servicing (refilling) of equipment in use.  
A common approach for quantifying the sum of the amount of HFC contained in new equipment 
added to the bank and the amount used for servicing, is to collect data on domestic sales of HFCs 
both in bulk and in equipment. Domestic sale is then the sum of production and imports, minus 
exports. If HFC is recovered in a country, this also needs to be taken into account, as the amount 
of HFCs recycled remains in the bank. 
Only a few countries produce HFCs. This means that when collecting data for domestic sales of 
HFCs in bulk, most inventory compilers will solely need to quantify the imports. Ideally, you want 
to know the amount of each kind of HFC imported to your country, and what kind of sub-
application it will be used in. You also need to collect data on (or estimate), the amount of HFC 
used for filling (production) of new equipment as opposed to the servicing of equipment already in 
use.  
New equipment 
HFC in new equipment is added to the bank when equipment is filled in the country or imported 
prefilled. HFC in exported equipment should not be added to the bank. See the spreadsheet 
"Calculation example for 2F1 (Tier 2)" for a detailed description on how to estimate the amount of 
HFCs entering the bank through new equipment and the emissions from this flow of chemicals.

BOX 7.2B (NEW) (CONTINUED) 
THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF  AN EMISSION INVENTORY FOR R/AC 
For example, if your country does not produce HFC-134a or manufacture cars (i.e. fill air 
conditioning units of new cars with this chemical), the annual addition of HFC-134a through new 
cars will only consist of the amount contained in imported cars. If your country does manufacture 
cars, but does not produce HFCs, the annual addition in new equipment will consist of HFC-134a 
contained in imported cars and the amount of HFC-134a imported in bulk for filling 
(manufacturing) of new cars, minus the amount contained in exported cars. 
See box 7.3a for tips on where to find data. 
 
• 
Refilling/servicing of equipment 
When existing equipment is being serviced and refilled with HFC, this will add to the bank. If data 
on servicing is difficult to obtain, a way of quantifying the amount used for this purpose is to 
assume it to be equal to the amount of chemicals emitted from operating equipment the previous 
year, taking into account that it should not exceed the amount of HFCs available in bulk. Another 
way to estimate the amount of HFCs used for servicing and refilling of equipment is to assume that 
it equals the estimated domestic sales minus the amount used for filling of new equipment. 
 
Flow of HFCs out of the bank 
HFC will mainly leave the bank through two processes: Emissions from the bank and through 
retired equipment. 
• 
Emissions during equipment lifetime 
Leakage of HFC from equipment in use, and hence emissions to the atmosphere, will remove 
chemicals from the bank. In the emission factor approach, this amount is estimated by applying an 
average emission factor per sub-application of equipment to the corresponding amount in the bank 
(equation 7.13). See Table 7.9 for default emission factors if national factors are not available. 
Note that the emission factors in Table 7.9 encompass annual leakage rates as well as emissions 
during service. 
 
• 
Retired equipment 
HFCs will also be removed from the bank when equipment is retired and scrapped or exported. 
Recycled HFC in the country will remain in the bank. The amount of HFCs in retired equipment is 
normally estimated based on average charge and the share of chemical remaining according to 
Table 7.9 and equation 7.14. 
The fate of the HFCs contained in the retired equipment will also need to be quantified, often by a 
combination of data collection, assumptions and emission factors. It can be reclaimed and reused, 
destroyed or emitted. The used equipment containing HFC can also be exported to other countries. 
See "Calculation example for 2F1 (Tier 2)" for a more detailed description of the possible 
fates/flows and how to quantify them.

HOW TO BUILD THE BANK OF HFC 
As described in Box 7.2B, it is essential to know the contents and structure of the bank of HFCs in 
order to estimate the emissions. In many cases this means that you need to quantify the bank from 
the year when HFCs were first used in a country up to the current year. There are two common 
ways of building the bank and the development back in time: 
1. Collecting historic data on domestic sales and flows of HFCs, starting at bank=0 
If data on domestic sales for all years since the HFCs were first introduced is available, this can be 
used to move forward from zero to the current bank by tracking the flow of chemicals into and out 
of the bank every year. This methodology is described in Box 7.2b. 
 
2. Counting the number of equipment currently in place and interpolate back to bank=0 
An alternative way of estimating the bank is to count the number of equipment units currently in 
place in a country and combine this with the average amount and type of HFCs contained in each 
type of equipment. This will provide an estimate of the current bank.   
The historic development of the bank can be estimated by interpolation, i.e. filling in the holes in 
the time series between the year of introduction of HFC to the current situation (current amount in 
the bank). Refer to Volume 1, Chapter 5 for information on interpolation and other splicing 
techniques. 
 
The following information on each of the relevant sub-applications need to be collected: 
• 
The number of equipment units currently installed 
• 
The average amount and type of HFC contained in each type of equipment 
• 
The year of introduction, i.e. when HFC were first used in this kind of equipment in the 
country 
 
Box 7.3a holds information on relevant data sources. For instance, the numbers of some kinds of 
equipment, like cars, might be available from national statistics or from a national register used for 
taxation. Industrial organizations often have statistics on mass-produced types of equipment, like 
numbers of household refrigerators, small air conditioning units, heat pumps and cars. If not, they 
might help you to estimate the sizes of markets, and hence consumption.  
It is often challenging to get information on the number of large refrigeration and air conditioning 
systems. You might need to estimate this using information on the number of, for instance, large 
office buildings, hospitals, universities etc. in your country. Then you need to combine this with 
information on the typical number and types of air conditioning units per building. Again, 
industrial associations can often be helpful in getting this sort of information.  
You need to collect information on the year each relevant kind of ODS-substitute was first used in 
each relevant type of equipment (sub-application) in your country (for instance, the year HFC-
134a was first used in mobile air conditioning in your country). If this information is not available, 
you can make reasonable assumptions based on, for example, the ODS phase-out schedule in your 
country and/or substitution patterns in countries similar to yours.  
Then, choose a method to fill in the years between year 0 and the current year. If you have no 
information on the development of the bank, a simple linear interpolation should be used. 
Otherwise, if some kind of information on the development is available, like the annual growth in 
sales of cars with air conditioning, this data can be used to model the bank year by year.

7.5.2.2 CHOICE OF EMISSION FACTORS 
Tier 1a/b method 
As explained within Section 7.5.2.1, Choice of Method, a composite emission factor is required to complete a 
Tier 1 method. Since the sub-applications within the refrigeration and air conditioning application are relatively 
heterogeneous, the validity of any single composite emission factor must be in doubt unless it takes into 
consideration the particular mix of sub-applications in the country. It is therefore good practice to develop 
composite emission factors on the basis of research within the country. The over-arching default emissions factor 
of 15 percent of the bank annually is used in the example of spreadsheet calculation, available at the IPCC web 
site: https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol3.html.  
Tier 2a method 
Good practice for choosing emission factors is to use country-specific data, based on information provided by 
equipment manufacturers, service providers, disposal companies, and independent studies. When national data 
are unavailable, inventory compilers should use the default emission factors shown in Table 7.9, Default 
Estimates for Charge, Lifetime and Emission Factors, which summarises best estimates of equipment charge, 
lifetime, emission factors during useful life, and parameters for end-of-life emissions.  If data used to calculate 
the refrigerant bank cannot be broken down into the sub-applications as in Table 7.9, it is good practice to divide 
the bank by type of equipment using expert judgement, and calculate composite emission factors weighted 
according to that relative share, as described for Tier 1a/b.  
Since the 2006 IPCC Guidelines were published, only a few new studies on leakage rates from stationary 
refrigeration and AC and mobile AC for some developed countries or regions have been published. The studies 
covering stationary refrigeration and AC indicate that the default values in Table 7.9 are still valid and thus are 
retained. For mobile AC, Table 7.9 is updated to include separate information on charge and annual emission 
factor during operating lifetime for maritime, railways, busses and other mobile ACs, based on Schwarz and 
Rhiemeier (2007) and Gallagher et al (2014).  
The values in Table 7.9 are provided as ranges rather than point estimates. Inventory compilers should choose 
from the range according to country-specific conditions and document the reasons for their choices. The lower 
end of the lifetime and emission factor ranges is expected to be applicable to developed countries and to 
countries that have a mandatory or voluntary system in place to limit emissions during equipment service and 
use. The upper end of each range is expected to be applicable to developing countries without systems for 
limiting emissions.  
Studies of emission rates in Japan for 2008 (Nomura Research Institute, Ltd, 2012), California for 2008 
(Gallagher, et. al., 2014) and Germany for 2009-2013 (Umweltbundesamt, 2015) confirmed that the average 
emission factors in these countries were close to the lower range for most sub-application categories within the 
application area of Stationary Refrigeration and Air Conditioning. These factors are given in Table 7A.1-7A.3 in 
Annex 7A.1 and are intended to serve as examples of emission rates for developed countries. Only countries 
with similar systems and regulations or incentives in place should consider using these factors for relevant years.  
For mobile air conditioning, emissions can occur during the useful life and during and after disposal of the 
equipment. Emission sources during the useful life include regular leaks (e.g. from seals), irregular leaks (e.g. 
due to accidents), and emissions during service (maintenance and refilling). The share of emissions from 
irregular leaks can be particularly large from passenger cars compared to other mobile vehicles as they are more 
likely to end up in accidents leading to eruption of the AC system. The default ranges in Table 7.9 encompass 
emissions from all stages. Several newer studies indicate that annual emission rates for modern passenger cars 
may be lower than the default lifetime emission factor lower range, e.g. see Schwarz and Harnisch (2003), Japan 
Automobile Manufacturers Association (2008), Papasavva et al. (2009), Clodic et al. (2011), Kim and Kim 
(2014), and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (2017). However, in most of the studies, the presented 
emission rates include only regular leaks, or only regular and irregular leaks, excluding emissions during 
servicing. It is good practice to include emissions from all three sources when choosing operating lifetime 
emission factors.  
There are few studies on remaining charge of refrigerants at end-of-life (p) and recovery efficiency (nrec) in 
equipment, e.g. Kim and Kim (2014), Wimberger (2010), Schwarz (2012), Gallagher, et, al. (2014).  
As the practice for mobile A/C service and disposal procedures may vary considerably between countries and 
over time, inventory compilers should investigate the national circumstances when developing country-specific 
factors 
for 
emissions 
and 
recovery 
efficiency. 
In 
some 
countries, 
A/C 
RRR 
service 
units 
(recover/recycle/recharge) are used to significantly reduce emissions at the service and disposal lifecycle stages. 
This will decrease emission factors during use and increase recovery efficiency (nrec) at end of life. Some 
Volume 3: Industrial Processes and Product Use  
 
 
7.32 
2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories 
countries have started to require recovery of refrigerants at the end-of-life, in which case the recovery efficiency 
could be higher than the suggested ranges in Table 7.9.   
It is good practise to consider applying different emission factors in different years to reflect improvements in 
service and disposal practices and in equipment design and materials. Changes in emission factors over time 
could also be appropriate for countries that have introduced mandatory periodical inspection and repair 
regulations/schemes or similar incentives.  
Some import and export of used vehicles and end-of-life vehicles occurs between countries (mostly from 
developed countries to developing countries). It is important for inventory compilers to take into account such 
flows of MAC equipment when estimating emissions from MAC as it may affect the composition of vehicle 
stock at various emission stages (lifetime and end-of-life).

7.5.2.3 CHOICE OF ACTIVITY DATA 
Tier 1a/b method 
Inventory compilers in countries that manufacture refrigerant chemicals should estimate Annual Sales of New 
Refrigerant using information provided by chemical manufacturers. Data on imported chemical should be 
collected from customs statistics, importers, or distributors.  
Total Charge of New Equipment can be estimated using either: 
• 
Information from equipment manufacturers/importers on the total charge of the equipment they manufacture 
or import; or 
• 
Information from chemical manufacturers/importers on their sales to equipment manufacturers and 
distributors. 
Ensure this information only includes sales as refrigerant, not feedstock or other uses. The difference between 
the total sales of new refrigerant and that charged in new equipment is assumed to be used for servicing. Where 
information on new equipment charges is unavailable, it can be assumed that, in a mature market, two thirds of 
refrigerant is used for servicing while one third is used for new equipment. However, the adoption of such 
assumptions must be accompanied by some justification about the state of the market and how well these 
assumptions are likely to apply.  
Tier 2 methods 
Both Tier 2a and Tier 2b methods require the development of a matrix for each sub-application based on 
equipment type on the one hand and refrigerant type on the other hand. In order to derive the number of pieces of 
equipment for all the vintages, historic net consumption activity data is also required. The annual update of the 
matrix makes it possible to recalculate all emission types as detailed in Equations 7.10 to 7.14 each year. 
Moreover, the refrigerant choice has to be assessed on a year-by-year basis owing to changing national 
regulations (often relating to CFC and HCFC phase-out at different dates) and changing technological choices. 
In some countries HFC refrigerant regulations have started to enter into force. 
Where country-specific data cannot be analysed to this level, globally or regionally validated activity data can be 
obtained from reputable databases based on refrigerant charges and lifetimes provided in Table 7.9, for all sub-
applications, to facilitate Tier 2 methods. A number of refinements are usually necessary dependent on the 
particular circumstances of the country. Assistance for this can be obtained from application experts. 
Other shared issues 
Whether collecting country-specific activity data in support of a Tier 1 or a Tier 2 method, inventory compilers 
must take care in dealing with refrigerant blends. Table 7.8 illustrates the complexity already existing and blends 
are only expected to increase in popularity as manufacturers of equipment seek for further improvements in 
performance, particularly in respect of energy efficiency. Where blends contain both HFCs and other 
components, only the reportable elements need to be considered. This is even the case for other components with 
significant GWPs (e.g., CFCs and HCFCs). 
Inventory compilers also need to consider how to monitor the movement of trade in equipment and products 
containing HFCs and/or PFCs. The Box 7.3 below sets out some of the measures required to estimate imports 
and exports adequately.

BOX 7.3 
ACCOUNTING FOR IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF REFRIGERANT AND EQUIPMENT 
In estimating Annual Sales of New Refrigerant, Total Charge of New Equipment, and Original 
Total Charge of Retiring Equipment, as required for Tier 2b, inventory compilers should account 
for imports and exports of both chemicals and equipment. This will ensure that they capture the 
actual domestic consumption of chemicals and equipment. For example, if a country imports a 
significant share of the HFC-134a that it uses, the imported quantity should be counted as part of 
Annual Sales. Alternatively, if a country charges and then exports a significant number of 
household refrigerators, the total charge of the exported refrigerators should be subtracted from the 
total charge of the household refrigerators manufactured in the country to obtain Total Charge of 
New Equipment. 
GENERAL APPROACH: In general, the quantity Annual Sales should be estimated using the 
following formula: 
 Annual Sales  
= Domestically Manufactured Chemical  
  
 
   + Imported Bulk Chemical 
  
 
   – Exported Bulk Chemical  
  
 
   + Chemical Contained in Factory-Charged Imported Equipment 
  
 
   – Chemical Contained in Factory-Charged Exported Equipment 
All quantities should come from the year for which emissions are being estimated. Similarly, the 
quantity of Total Charge of New Equipment should be estimated using the following: 
 Total Charge of New Equipment  
  
 
=   Chemical to Charge Domestically Manufactured Equipment that  
  
 
      is not Factory-Charged 
  
 
  + Chemical to Charge Domestically Manufactured Equipment that is 
  
 
      Factory-Charged 
  
 
  + Chemical to Charge Imported Equipment that is not Factory-Charged 
  
 
  + Chemical Contained in Factory-Charged Imported Equipment 
  
 
  – Chemical Contained in Factory-Charged Exported Equipment 
Original Total Charge of Retiring Equipment should be estimated the same way as Total Charge 
of New Equipment, except all quantities should come from the year of manufacture or import of the 
retiring equipment. 
SIMPLIFIED APPROACH: In estimating Annual Sales and Total Charge of New Equipment, it is 
possible to ignore the quantities of chemical imported or exported inside of factory-charged 
equipment if these quantities cancel out in the calculation of emissions. However, inventory 
compilers that use the simplified calculation should ensure that: (1) they treat imports and exports 
of factory-charged equipment consistently in estimating both Annual Sales and Total Charge New 
of Equipment; and (2) they continue to account for imports and exports of factory-charged 
equipment in estimating Original Total Charge of Retiring Equipment. As new equipment will 
eventually become retiring equipment, countries may wish to track imports and exports of factory-
charged equipment even if this information is not strictly necessary to develop the current year’s 
estimate.  
The simplified formula for Annual Sales is: 
 Annual Sales  
= Domestically Manufactured Chemicals  
  
 
   + Imported Bulk Chemicals 
  
 
   – Exported Bulk Chemicals 
The simplified formula for Total Charge of New Equipment is: 
 Total Charge of New Equipment  
  
 
=   Chemicals to Charge Domestically Manufactured Equipment  
  
 
  + Chemical to Charge Imported Equipment that is not Factory-Charged 
The full formula, accounting for imports and exports of pre-charged equipment, must be used to 
calculate Original Total Charge of Retiring Equipment.

BOX 7.3A (NEW) 
COMMON DATA SOURCES FOR THE HFC INVENTORY  
This box provides a short description of common data sources for the HFC inventory, 
complementing Table 7.10 in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Examples of data are production, 
imports, exports and destruction of HFC and equipment containing HFC. Numbers of equipment 
units and growth rates in sales are also data commonly collected. 
Governmental reports 
Most countries have collected data for Refrigerant Management Plans (RMPs) or HCFC Phase-out 
Management Plans (HPMPs) through ODS-alternatives surveys. The consumption data generally 
contain information on: 
- total past consumption of CFCs, and total current and past consumption of HCFCs and possibly 
also HFCs. Data on ODS are often given in ODP tonnes, which can be converted into metric 
tonnes using the substance-specific ODP values;  
- sector-specific consumption of HCFCs and possibly also HFCs (e.g. amounts used in air 
conditioning, refrigeration, fire extinguishers, aerosols etc.);  
- breakdown of HCFCs according to their use at each lifecycle stage such as 
manufacturing/assembly (initial charge) or servicing (refill) 
 
Some countries have begun monitoring HFC consumption due to the inclusion of HFCs in the 
Montreal protocol. Countries that have ratified the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol will 
be required to report consumption data on HFCs (production, import and export) annually. 
 
European Member States report annually to the European Commission on production and imports 
of HFCs in bulk, in line with the EU F-Gas Regulation. 
Surveys 
There is often a limited number of companies producing, importing and exporting HFC in bulk; 
hence a way to obtain high quality data is to ask the producers, importers, and exporters for 
information. They should be able to provide information on the amount of gas they produce, 
import, or export in a certain year. In addition, they may be able to indicate the equipment types in 
which each HFC or blend is used.  
The number of companies importing equipment containing HFC can be large, and surveying this 
might be resource intensive. If this is the case, other data sources such as sales statistics or national 
customs registers (see below) may be used instead. 
Surveys can also be a way to obtain information on HFC from end-users. Generally, this requires 
good knowledge of the market and preparatory market research may be needed before launching a 
survey.  
Surveys can also be a way to discover areas and applications previously unknown to the inventory 
compilers.  
National Customs Registers 
National Customs Registers contain information on imports and exports of chemicals and 
equipment potentially containing HFC. If the HFC are subject to tax, such a register might provide 
the amounts of refrigerant contained in the products. If not, it will probably be necessary to make 
assumptions regarding the identities and amounts (charge sizes) of HFCs in different types of 
equipment, multiplying the charge size by the number of equipment units of each type to obtain the 
total amount of that HFC imported.

COMMON DATA SOURCES FOR THE HFC INVENTORY  
Other national registers 
Many countries have national registers of cars uses for taxation purposes. This data source might 
provide figures on the number of cars, and possibly other information like age and size.  
National Product Register/European Chemical Agency: In some countries, a national Products 
Register is used to store information on chemical products (including HFC) that are manufactured 
in or transferred or imported into the country and information on the ways in which these are being 
used.  
Industrial organizations 
Industrial organizations or trade associations often have statistics on mass-produced types of 
equipment, like numbers of household refrigerators, small air conditioning units, heat pumps and 
cars.  
If not, they might help with assessments of the size of markets, and hence the consumption figures. 
It is often challenging to get information on the number of large refrigeration and air conditioning 
systems. Industrial organizations might provide useful information like annual growth in sales of 
equipment and average charge size of various types of equipment. 
National statistics 
Many countries have national offices publishing annual statistics with useful information, like the 
stock of vehicles and buildings (number or area by type of building), or production of 
commodities.  
 
7.5.2.4 APPLYING TIER 2 METHODS – THE EXAMPLE OF MOBILE AIR 
CONDITIONING (MAC) 
The Box 7.4 below sets out the step-by-step approach required to assess the emissions from the mobile air 
conditioning sub-application of a hypothetical country’s inventory. The method adopted is primarily a Tier 2a 
approach, although there are also elements which would be equally applicable to Tier 2b. This example, 
therefore, highlights the reality that pure approaches and methods are rare in practice. There will often be a mix 
of emission-factor approach and mass–balance approach as well as a mix of country-specific data and globally or 
regionally derived data. As pointed out in Section 7.1.2.1, one method, approach or dataset will often be used to 
cross-check another. This example also demonstrates that a detailed implementation of the Tier 2a method 
requires a significant amount information gathering about a sub-application. Once established, it is less 
burdensome to implement the approach in subsequent years. Also note that assumptions made are for example 
only; inventory compilers should collect country-specific information rather than using the assumptions shown.

BOX 7.4 (UPDATED) 
EXAMPLE OF THE APPLICATION OF A TIER 2A CALCULATION FOR MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING 
Introduction 
National inventories and other studies to date show that emissions of HFC-134a from mobile air 
conditioners (MACs) contribute significantly to the Refrigeration and Air Conditioning (RAC) 
Application emissions and the ODS Substitutes Category emissions. For many countries, 
emissions from MACs will comprise 50 percent or more of the RAC emissions and possibly more 
than 50 percent of the total ODS Substitutes Category emissions.  This is due to many factors, 
including: 
• 
The phaseout of ODSs to HFCs in MACs occurred earlier and more quickly than other Sub-
Applications, such as residential (stationary) air conditioning and commercial refrigeration 
(supermarkets), which still rely substantially on ODSs. 
• 
MACs are subject to extremes in terms of physical shock and vibration and hence emissions 
tend to be large. 
• 
The lifetime of MACs tends to be shorter than many other RAC Sub-Applications, so that 
end-of-life emissions are seen earlier and equipment stocks relying on ODSs are replaced 
sooner with HFCs. 
• 
Due to the small charge of refrigerant involved, recovery from MACs is often seen as 
uneconomical and hence is not often practiced during service and disposal. 
In addition, data on vehicle purchases and registrations in a country are often known to a higher 
degree of quality or are easily obtained.  Hence, it is good practice to estimate emissions from this 
Sub-Application. The following text describes how the general equations for the RAC Application 
can be applied to the MAC Sub-Application. 
Data Gathering and Assumptions 
An accurate estimate of MAC emissions may be obtained by collecting some data at the Sub-
Application level and applying a few basic assumptions to simplify the data and calculations 
required, as follows: 
Refrigerant Type.  It will be important to separate each data point by refrigerant, so that emissions 
of each refrigerant are calculated separately. For MACs, this may be simplified by the fact that all 
MACs produced since the mid- to late-1990s use HFC-134a as the refrigerant. However, CFC-12 
was used in the past and still exists in some operating systems. Furthermore, for the future other 
refrigerants such as HFC-152a and R-744 (carbon dioxide) are being considered.   
Refrigerant Sold in Containers (RMt).  For MACs, refrigerant generally comes in three basic 
types of containers – ‘bulk containers’ sent to vehicle manufacturers to fill new MACs, ‘small 
cans’ containing about 300-500 grams of refrigerant generally used by individuals servicing their 
own equipment, and ‘cylinders’ containing about 10-15 kilograms of refrigerant used by shops that 
service many vehicles. If one assumes no losses from bulk containers (see below), then in order to 
calculate Econtainers, one needs to know the total refrigerant sold in small cans (RMsc) and cylinders 
(RMcy). It will be important to distinguish the refrigerant sold into different Sub-Applications (e.g., 
HFC-134a is also used in the chillers and domestic refrigeration Sub-Applications) so that only the 
refrigerant sold for MACs is used in the calculations. This data may be obtained from small can 
packagers and refrigerant producers/distributors. 
Container Heels (c).  For this example, we assume the heels from service containers are not 
recovered (e.g., the cylinders are discarded, not reused) and are csc = 20 percent for the small can 
and ccy = 2 percent for the cylinder.  Because bulk refrigerant containers generally go back to the 
refrigerant producer and are refilled, we can assume there are no heels that would be emitted and 
hence cbulk = 0 percent.

EXAMPLE OF THE APPLICATION OF A TIER 2A CALCULATION FOR MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING 
MACs Produced Each Year (Nt).  If the number of MACs placed in service each year is not 
known, an estimate can be made by multiplying the number of cars placed in service each year by 
an estimate of the percentage that were sold with MACs. These data may be available from 
automobile manufacturers, MAC producers/suppliers, or government agencies involved in 
transportation, infrastructure and highway safety. If more than one type of refrigerant is used, it is 
important to separate each Nt into the different refrigerants, e.g., N1994 = N1994,CFC-12 + N1994,HFC-
134a. 
Nominal Charge of Each MAC (mt).  This factor would likely vary by the type of vehicle; for 
instance small passenger cars will likely have lower refrigerant charges than buses or larger cars, 
especially those with multiple evaporators. Likewise, this could vary over time, for instance 
decreasing as manufacturers make smaller systems for the same vehicle size, or increasing as 
larger cars and more multiple-evaporator units enter the market. For this example, we assume a 
constant over time at an average m = 0.7 kg, which is typical of small to medium-sized passenger 
cars. 
Refrigerant Charged into New Equipment (Mt).  This is easily calculated as Mt = Nt • mt = 0.7 • 
Nt. 
Assembly Losses (k).  This is used to calculate the Charge Emissions, also referred to as ‘First-Fill 
Emissions.’ The loss rate is often small, on the order of k = 0.5 percent or smaller. For simplicity, 
we assume k = 0 in this example. 
Lifetime (d).  The presumed lifetime of a MAC.  This variable can be based on national data and 
can be different for different types of MACs (passenger cars, buses, etc.) For this example, we 
assume the lifetime of all MACs is d = 12 years. 
Bank in Existing Equipment (B).  The bank will be the amount of refrigerant in MACs put into 
service, minus the amount of refrigerant in MACs disposed, plus the amount of refrigerant used to 
service MACs, minus the amount that has leaked.  In actuality, a given MAC will probably leak 
over several years before being serviced. Rather than attempting to account for this, for this 
example we apply Equation 7.13 which assumes all MACs are serviced each year such that the 
estimated charge of each MAC is the same as the nominal charge. The annual emission rate is 
averaged to account for this assumption. This will only produce small errors unless the year-to-
year sales of MACs fluctuate widely. Hence the bank in any given year is the sum of the 
Refrigerant Charged into New Equipment each year from the current year back to the assumed 
average lifetime of the equipment.  Thus,

For example, using d = 12 years, the bank in 2006 would be B2006 = M2006 + M2005 + M2004 + … + 
M1997 + M1996 + M1995. 
Annual Emission Rate (x).  This factor accounts for both leaks from equipment as well as any 
emissions during service. Both of these items can be different for different types of MACs and can 
also vary by when the MAC was produced (i.e., older MACs may leak more than newer MACs).  
If annual servicing does not occur, the amount emitted at any servicing event needs to be average 
over the number of years between servicing event to obtain the annual rate. This amount is likely 
to vary considerably depending on national conditions and what type(s) of service is (are) 
performed.  Whether recovery of the given charge before service is performed must be considered, 
and may be deduced in part by examining the amount of refrigerant sold in small cans versus 
cylinders. For this example, we assume that 15 percent of the nominal charge is leaked each year 
and 5 percent on average is emitted during servicing.  Hence, x = 20 percent.  
Residual Charge in MACs Disposed (p).  Assuming that the MAC is serviced the year before it is 
disposed, and that the annual nominal charge is estimated, this is easily calculated as p = 1 –
nominal charge.  In our example, p = 1 – 15 % = 0.85.

Recovery Efficiency (nrec).  If no regulations or incentives exist to require recovery of 
refrigerant from MACs disposed, then likely very little will occur.  So, for this example, we 
assume that nrec = 0. 
Calculation of Different Types of Emissions  
Now that these data have been gathered and assumptions have been made, calculating the 
emissions may be performed.  An example for year t = 2006 follows:

EXAMPLE OF THE APPLICATION OF A TIER 2A CALCULATION FOR MOBILE AIR CONDITIONING 
If the emissions from refrigerant containers and from end-of-life are not included, for example if it 
is believed that service cylinders are completely evacuated and minimal MACs reach their end-of-
life in the given year, this equation becomes simply an activity (the number of MACs) multiplied 
by an emission factor (annual emission rate times average charge size, in this case 0.14 kg per 
MAC).  This calculation yields the total emissions in kilograms of refrigerant.  Keeping each 
refrigerant separate and multiplying each sum by the refrigerant’s GWP will yield kilograms of 
CO2 equivalent emissions.  Dividing by 1 billion (109) will yield emissions in teragrams of CO2 
equivalent (TgCO2eq).

Annex 7A.1 (New) Examples of national studies on emission rates 
for stationary refrigeration and air-conditioning systems 
The three sets of emission factors presented below are intended to serve as examples of emission rates (and in 
one case recovery efficiency at end-of-life) for stationary refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Only 
countries with similar systems and regulations or incentives in place should consider using these factors for 
relevant years. In each table, the IPCC sub-application (found in Table7.9) are amended for the purpose of 
reference.
